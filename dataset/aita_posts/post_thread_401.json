  "post content": "Where I live, real estate developers have started snatching up family homes, bulldozing them and building enormous 2 million dollar houses on the plots of land. The houses also stick out horribly in terms of aesthetics \u2013 think single level brick homes with a 3-level gigantic white and black box in the middle.\n\nMy home\u2019s been in my family for several generations. We have always been known for having a large, beautiful garden. We invited over kids to help with gardening, we gave away so many veggies, we\u2019d hold parties, etc. It\u2019s been a neighborhood treasure for years.\n\nUntil developers snatched up the lot next door, bulldozed and erected an enormous house that blocked out the light to most of the garden. Many of us tried to fight it with the city but everything was denied. It was heartbreaking. Our neighborhood has been changed forever. This was a link to my family and I almost have had to go through a grieving process for it.\n\nThe new owners moved in and were not welcomed warmly by people in the neighborhood. I avoided them for as long as I could, other than politely waving or nodding. It was a young couple in their early 20s.\n\nWe finally came face to face and the woman asked if we could chat. She said that they felt like maybe they\u2019d done something wrong when they moved in, or if they aren\u2019t pulling in their trash bins or something, being too loud, etc, because people haven\u2019t been very friendly. The guy says that he\u2019s surprised considering it felt like a \u201cnice\u201d and somewhat \u201caffluent\u201d neighborhood, and given the price, he was expecting friendly neighbors.\n\nI asked if they had done any research about the area. They said that they moved from California, so no. I said that maybe that was their mistake?\n\nThey said they didn\u2019t know what I meant, so I asked if they\u2019d ever looked in our backyard. They said yes and said they think the garden is cute.\n\nI said \u201cYes, the garden that now has about half less sunlight than before that house was built was a neighborhood treasure.\"\n\nThe guy said \u201cWell it\u2019s not our fault you built the garden there, is it?\u201d\n\nI said \u201cWell, you guys got what you paid for. 2 million dollars for a house that everyone in the neighborhood hates.\u201d I said that I hoped it was worth it and wished them a nice day.\n\nWhen I told another neighbor about the exchange, she told me that she does feel bad for them moving without having any idea what they were getting themselves into.\n\nAITA for telling them that they got what they paid for?",

YTA. \n\nThat couple did nothing wrong--they bought a house that was on the market. Now, if they had been the ones to buy the house/land from the previous owner, bulldoze it down, and then build their million dollar mansion, you might have a leg to stand on. But from what you say in the post, the neighborhood is taking out their frustration/anger on an innocent couple.",

It started with being angry at the developers but then devolved into making fun of the buyers\u2026\u2019they bought a $2M house but put up Ikea blinds\u2019 kinds of things.

Note that these are 70 year old ramblers that were part of a giant development at the time and many haven\u2019t been renovated since then.  And the sellers are getting top dollar plus the lots are mostly good sized so these aren\u2019t lot line to lot line houses.

The generations old homes are being sold off one by one so new, taller, more snazzy homes can go up in their place and it's changed the whole look of our once sweet little neighborhood with the individual flower gardens and its a shame. But who do we blame? The people who bought a home in our neighborhood because they've been told it's safe, the schools are great, there's both skiing and watersports 15 mins from us? Or the people who bought our neighbors home and is flipping it for double the price? How about blaming your dear old neighbor who sold it in the first place? Surely they could see what was happening around the neighborhood and knew their property they were selling would likely end up like all the other new homes?\n\nPoint is: OP is angry at the wrong person. These new owners only bought a good home in an excellent neighborhood,  can you blame them for that? Seriously,  if you are going to be angry at anyone, be angry at your old next door neighbor for selling out.  I think it's crazy OPs neighborhood are taking their anger out at the new neighbors rather than the old ones. As soon as you see that For Sale sign go up, go speak to your neighbor and address your complaints and concerns. They can probably find buyers who aren't  going to tear the entire home down to build a metal monstrosity in its place, if the neighborhood is that hot. I think these new neighbors deserve an apology from the OP and the others who are holding them responsible for their home taking 1/2 the shade. Blame the person who initiated this process, not the ones who unwittingly bought a house in a good neighborhood that was up for sale. How were they supposed to know their house was blocking the sun from OP beloved garden? You owe them an apology OP, YTA",

Google the neighborhood to see if there\u2019s anything in the news about it since OPs complaints went up to city level so there likely is an article in the local paper about it? And I don\u2019t get the impression that there is hostility. Just that they\u2019re maybe being cold? I think automatically expecting your neighbors to be warm and welcoming is strange but I also never had neighbors that did more than that little nod hand wave thing so maybe it\u2019s a cultural difference or something.",

Local planning authorities can really drop the ball at times and other times some individuals can really get their knickers in a twist on evolving aesthetics fixed from solely their view point/taste.\n\nBut to extend unpleasant behaviour away from the developer/authorities onto new owners, purely because they exist and purchased the property, is bonkers.",

There are lots of areas where these \u201caffluent\u201d homes are built that are planned in this way. Neighbors could have bought one of those. They are not absolved of any guilt just because they weren\u2019t the ones who bought and developed the land. We all have to participate in this society but sometimes people act like that gives us a blank check to take part in bad behavior because it\u2019s less convenient to do otherwise. We all have our own individual capacities to do good and act in accordance with our values, and it\u2019s okay that that\u2019s different for everyone. This isn\u2019t an issue of flying commercial while saying you are concerned about climate change.

You did NO research on the community, you don\u2019t know anyone in the neighborhood but you heard people were \u201cnice.\u201d You purchase a house that is significantly pricier and larger than a bunch of others around you with absolutely no regard for how that impacts this \u201cnice\u201d community you heard about. And then you have the nerve to act entitled to people welcoming you when you arrive. Gentrification does not only rely on developers, homeowners like these are absolutely a part of the problem. I\u2019d tell those same neighbors to tell all their friends to consider the impact of their movements and the literal space they take up before repeating the same dumb move.",

Most people my age are barely scraping by, regardless of state they come from, California or otherwise.
