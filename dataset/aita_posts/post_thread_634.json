  "post content": "Okay, so this happened last night and I'm still angry about it but my wife says I'm out of line.\n\nLast night we went out to eat for my dad's 60 birthday. There were 6 of us and we went to one of those Japanese steakhouses with the hibachi table. Those tables seat 8 people, and it was pretty busy so we assumed another couple would be joining us. We end up at a table with a seemingly nice older couple. We make some small talk and all order our food.\n\nWhen the chef comes out and starts to cook, my dad notices the chef is cutting the fat off of the steak and throwing it away. My dad nicely asked if he could just cook up the fat for him instead of throwing it away. (My dad LOVES the fat more than the steak itself). The chef cheerfully agrees and starts gathering the fat from all of the steaks to cook in a separate pile for him.\n\nThe women sitting at our table told the chef \"I don't want him to have the fat from my steak!\".\n\nThe chef was apologetic and said he didn't know she wanted the fat too and he will split it between them. The women assured him she didn't want any of the fat, she just didn't want him to have something that was hers.\n\nThis is when I spoke up and asked her why this was an issue. She replied saying that it was her fat and she could do what she pleased with it.\n\nI told her it was pretty selfish to throw it away just so someone else couldn't have it. She furthered her argument by saying that she didn't want his hands all over her food, which made even less sense because it wouldn't be touching her plate at all.\n\nWe went back and forth a little bit before I gave up and told the chef to throw her portion away and just give my dad the rest, not before I called her out again for being selfish though.\n\nThis all ruined the entire evening for my family and for theirs. My wife is blaming me because I shouldn't have tried to take another person's food. Which I understand, to an extent. But she was just wasting it for the sake of not letting my dad have it. So, AITA for calling this woman out and wanting her to give my dad the fat from her steak?\n\nEDIT: I know my title says I yelled at her, but I just used \"yelling\" more as a catch all for confronting her. My tone was super seasy going and chill the whole time. But my choice of words weren't the nicest.\n\nAlso, my dad was on my side and not embarrassed or anything if that helps. He is battling stage IV colorectal cancer right now and he said this stupid argument made his week. No blaming dad, please. He did nothing wrong and didn't ask for anyone elses fat, just his own\n\nI'm honestly surprised by how polarizing these opinions are. But I'll come to the consesus that we all suck here (but I'll stick to my guns and say mostly her)",
