  "post content": "My boyfriend (both 20, been together around six months) and I were getting drunk together on Zoom last night and playing a good-natured game of truth or dare. For my truth, he asked me if I would ever post/send nudes to make money and I said \"Hell yeah! I already have actually...\" He thought I was fucking with him at first, but when I told him I was serious he kinda freaked out and asked me what I posted, what type of posts, etc.\n\nI explained to him that my ex and I used to post videos of us having sex on Pornhub to help him pay his tuition and for his mom's chemo. All the videos were amateur and anon and none of our faces were ever in them. We developed a pretty popular profile and some of our videos racked up close to one million views. My boyfriend was shocked speechless at this point and kept asking me if I was joking, and because I was drunk I just kept going and trying to over-correct (I knew I was digging myself a hole, but I just kept talking). I told him we only did it for about a year and after we broke up, he deleted all of the videos from our account. My boyfriend asked me if I was forced into doing it for his pleasure/gain and I said no, I really enjoyed it. I really did not see a problem with it at the time\u2014and I still don't\u2014since I was so in love with him, we had a phenomenal sex life, I liked being filmed, and I was helping my him pay for college.\n\nWell, my boyfriend did not take to that well at all despite me reassuring him that I was always anon, the videos are deleted, and that I no longer film myself. He looked literally heartbroken and said that he was really upset and needed time to process this. He also asked why I didn't tell him earlier to which I responded that I didn't think it was something that I needed to disclose, but that I never tried to intentionally keep it from him. He then just hung up on me and texted me that he needed time. I respect that and left him alone.\n\nHe texted me this morning telling me he thinks he failed his midterm because he couldn't concentrate. That really hurt me because now I think it's my fault. I just really did not expect him to get that offended. He's definitely a fair share more conservative (raised in a very religious family) than the other guys I've dated, but our values and beliefs align on the biggest issues and we've never had a problem with it before. I don't know...AITA?\n\nEdit: Lol why do I feel like this post was infiltrated by incels?? There's a lot of hate here for women and the way they use their bodies for no apparent reason. \n\nUpdate: Boyfriend texted an hour ago saying he wanted to FaceTime and talk it out. I'm about to call him, we'll see how it goes down.",

I'd normally say that would be way over the line of TMI and the exploits with a past partner really should not be shared with a current one, but he did ask.\n\nI can see that being a very bitter pill to swallow.
