  "post content": "My wife(44F) makes quite a bit less than me(45M) so our joint expenses are split 70/30. For the most part things like vacations and where we bought a house are decided based on what she can afford, but there have been several times I've paid in full for vacations to places I really enjoy and wanted to share the experience with her.\n\nShe has a 23y/o son from her previous marriage. When she and I got together I told her I wouldn't mind paying extra for things here and there until her son was 18 and working or in school so she could take care of him. For the majority of our relationship, he has lived with his father. He decided against college or trade school and hasn't expressed any interest in starting to figure out a plan for the immediate future let alone his life. He floats from job to job, and his father is pretty much the same since the kid graduated. Therein lies the problem: every few months they'll call her for a few hundred dollars here, a few hundred there, 20 bucks this week, 80 the next. Sometimes it's her son calling for help, sometimes it's her ex-husband. This has caused her to be short on funds for our plans, or things she volunteered to cover on more than one occasion. Her reasoning when its her ex asking is that since their son still lives with him, she has to help him. I get that to a point.\n\nWe were supposed to go on a vacation later this month. Nothing major or fancy but just time away. We had agreed to split the cost and all that was left to pay for were the hotels, rental car, and some reservations. Her ex-husband called needing help getting his car out of impound and getting caught up on rent. Their son hasn't been able to get to work without the car because he doesn't want to ride a bike or take a bus. Almost 5 grand later they're set up but my wife told me she can't pay for her portion of our vacation, so I told her I was canceling it. She called me a heartless ass, that she's just taking care of her son and we've been arguing over it but my stance is this: they're both able-bodied adults that keep making a series of life decisions that keep them at a stand still (like quitting jobs over little things, smoking, going out) and her always digging them out of their hole is starting to impact our lives more and more, and I didn't sign up for that. AITA for canceling our vacation instead of just footing the entire cost myself?\n\n\\*\\*\\*To clarify: She contributes 30% of her pay to our joint expenses: bills/utilities, emergency fund, retirement. 70% of her pay she keeps for her personal expenses and to spend or save how she wishes. Dates, vacations, and fun things we choose to do together are budgeted and planned based on what we can afford from our personal funds. Pool that money together than pay together.",

You got a friend that's an alcoholic and spends way too much money on booze when they go grocery shopping and are often struggling to have food to eat. Giving them money so they can go to the grocery store again is not going to help. They'll just buy more booze. If they really want to help, they would go grocery shopping with them. They would help them get into rehab. They would go to their house and take away all their alcohol. Etc.\n\nThat's harder than just giving them some money though and actually having a conversation and helping her son actually plan for a future, budget, live within his means... and unbelievably her ex, is way harder than opening her wallet. Its pure selfish feelings of wanting that dopamine hit of being needed. Its almost intentional to avoid actual help because then they would stop needing her.

It's great to say that you should actually attack the root cause of an issue and that is defined as help. I agree with this assesment that the wife is not actually helping and just enabling the behavior. I agree that what she is doing will never allow for growth or change and that the husband is enabling her to enable them financially. But, sometimes help is not accepted. Let's use your alcoholic analogy but make it a child and not a friend. If her kid is an alcoholic that lives on his own and spends way too much money to the point that he doesn't have rent or food that's an issue. Adressing the root cause of it \"the kids alcoholism\" is the right move. Going with them to the grocery store or getting them in rehab are valid options, but what if the kid doesn't believe they have a problem? What if when offering to help address the root of the issue the mother is met with denial and anger? People that tend to have issues don't like to be reminded or even shown that they have an issue. Since the truth is they probably know but aren't ready to admit it yet. Common sense would say just cut these people out of your life because they are exhibiting toxic behavior that is now affecting the person trying to help. But, this person is your child. You don't give up on your children, you always try to love and protect them, and if they won't address the root cause of their issue you find a way to help any way you can. Even if for the time being it only allows them to keep doing what they are doing. I still agree that the new husband is NTA, he has no dog in this fight and should not be penalized because her wife's ex and kid cannot get their act together. Just trying to point out that in life most situations aren't as clean as \"just go address the root cause of the issue\"",

Speculations about OPs wife still being in a kind of relationship with her ex are really not helpful as infidelity is not a part of the problem here. \n\nOPs wife loves her son and wants to help him. But the way she tries to achieve this will not lead to success, as neither son not ex seem to be able to manage their finances properly.\n\nOP needs to sit his wife down and together they need to sit the son down and find a way where him getting money is connected with achievments like holding down a job or attending a college.\n\nI would like to add that people are mistaken if they think that young people are able to manage her life the moment they turn 18. Often the grown up behaviour does not set in before the age of 25, and they need a lot of guidance in the meantime. \n\nOP saying that he did not mind to pay here or there till her son was 18 implies that he expected her paying for her son to end then, and she being able to contribute to the lifestyle he obviously can afford more easily than she can. Of course it is his right to do what he wants with his money, and obviously he likes his wife to be with him on his vacations, but he seems oddly unaware of the fact a mother will never stop being a mother and will likely support her son no matter what. I have a feeling that he is quite distant to this part of his wifes life.\n\nHis wife needs to accept that her way to help her son does not work, and that she needs to either engage fully and help him to do better with all her might, or to quit helping and to let the son lie in the bed he makes. Both ways are not easy and she will need OPs help and not be able to be there only for OP.\n\nI really hope they can manage this.",

You don't seem to approve, but you also seem to accept it's her decision. She has a history of prioritizing her son as she should, but also she seems to be enabling her ex and son with her decision making. I don't think you are an AH for not wanting to supplement her ex/son with your income, which is exactly what would be happening if you continued to pay for the vacation with only your money. I don't see anything wrong with what you did, but I also see why others would not agree. It sounds like you had an agreement the vacation was to be split cost, and your wife tried to flip on that.",
