  "post content": "My(34f) wedding is at the end of June. I have 4kids all under the age of 6, go to school full time and am planning my wedding which as many of you married Redditors know, it's not just cake sampling and flower arranging. Fiance and I decided on a big party 8 bridesmaids 8 groomsmen. we both come from big families. Maybe I'm just stressed out and letting my emotions get the best of me idk.\n\none of my bridesmaid is J (33) whose been a friend since grade school. I love her but she can also be selfish at times. that's kind of why I feel like I'm an a hole I should have known something like this would happen but I guess I hoped she would suck it up for my wedding.\n\nJ has been job hopping lately. I like to take my bp (bridal party) out on lunch  dates, pedicures, dress shopping, just so they're all comfy with one another. I totally get if someone can't go but all of them have been great with scheduling and putting in an effort to make everything easy and fun. except J. whenever me or my maid of honors says about getting together her immediate reply: I don't know if I can get off like you guys. Whatever. BP decided to have a weekend getaway before the wedding. We all picked April to go, even J and we worked specifically around J's schedule. in April the hotel just has a better deal and saved us all some money. I collect the money, reserve the rooms ahead of time and guess what J gets a new job. April apparently doesn't work now. She doesn't want to ask so soon for a vacation from this new job. She wants to change it to early June so I cancel the reservation because June they're booked and it cost more. I find a new hotel in the city but it's too expensive for J. So I get a new one. it's just been chaos. To top it off yesterday I got a text from her with no apology: yeah I'm really hoping to get that weekend off for the girl's trip. But I don't think I'm going to ask for that weekend and the rehearsal day off. I'm going to have to skip one.\n\nI'm done. I'm stressed and losing my mind. she has shown no compassion towards all the changes I have to make for her and any compassion towards the other girls some who have more responsibilities than her. AITA ?",

Nothing more. All of the rest is icing on the cake.

I say she is an asshole, too, because she should not expect you to reschedule around her--she should just explain why she cannot attend, and also she should be putting in an effort to show up at the rehearsal as it is important.",
