  "post content": "My women in stem group is sponsored by the company. We invite both men and women to join. There\u2019s a part of the business called AI that is booming over the pandemic and lots of people are wondering about job opportunities in our department. Because of this, two girls who run the women in stem group thought it would be a good idea to have a series of \u201ca day in the life\u201d sessions.\n\nThe first session covered manufacturing and two girls who work in that group presented their jobs. The session was a big hit (lots of executives joined, and we had over 150 ppl on the call!) and at the end they sent a survey out asking what people would like to hear next. My group is marketing and had the most interest. \n\nNow my group is relatively small. There are 6 people total and I\u2019m the only girl. So It made sense that the organizers immediately reached out to me to ask if I\u2019d do it  and I said sure- I\u2019d love to present. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, my male, white, roughly 45 year old boss (who SAYS he\u2019s participates in our women in stem group for 10 years, but I never see him at any events...) reaches out a few days later to the organizers and volunteered himself to do the presentation. Queue the awkward moment where the organizers reached back out to me and asked if I\u2019d be willing to tag team with my male boss.\n\nThis is where i may be the a**hole (and my husband is saying I would be)- but i had already planned to reach out to one of the executive girls who is no longer in my group, but covered it for 8 years prior, to tag team with me. I thought it would be a great way for (1) me to network with this successful female and (2) for a successful female to showcase their progression from the group. I want to ask my male boss NOT to present with me. i talked to my husband and said it was just so odd that my boss, who manages the ONLY female in the group, reached out to present it himself rather reach out to me and see if I\u2019d be willing. But my husband is saying he\u2019s part of the group and he should have just as much of a \u201cright\u201d to present as I do. \n\nWIBTA if I asked him to bug off? The entire purpose in my mind of the women in stem group is to boost representation of females in the company. Doesn\u2019t a male presuming he is best fit to present the topic defeat the purpose? The series is getting a lot of executive attention and would be a great place to showcase the females actually working in their space.",

Also, I agree with all the other comments saying you should tell the organizers your original idea. \n\nAnd yeah, I had a boss once who actually underpaid his female staff and didn\u2019t necessarily give them the same opportunities as the men, and the made this hugely public (and very positively received) statement about the lack of equality in the workplace and the pay gap. He had the audacity to not pay his female workers a livable wage and the public proclaim how much he supported closing the wage gap and providing women with opportunities to grow. My other female coworker and I chatted about how it made us feel to be so disregarded, someone else overheard, got back to the boss, who then called me in to his office to admonish me about gossiping and how hurt he felt. I explained that I wasn\u2019t gossiping, I was just sharing how hurt *I* was that he thought it was ok to preach and not act. And that he not only underpaid us (excuse after excuse for that) and expected us to work longer hours than were scheduled, stated, etc, but when he announced new positions that were available, shit both of us down when we spoke about potentially applying. And then I reminded him that I was working a job that was supposed to be temporary so I could move into a different position, but they never even opened that position, so I\u2019m out. At that point, I was the office manager, assistant to a department head, manager of the department, and expected to also somehow be the receptionist (i straight up refused), water the plants, and man the catch all email. I put in my 2 weeks and left them scrambling in my wake. I got calls for 5 months afterwards about where was this or that (in the closet in the section labeled that) and what happened to this, even after I left a list of updated project progress and a guide to where everything was and how it was organized. They stopped calling when I started telling them that I had removed all their company files and information off of my computer so I couldn\u2019t help. \n\nSo I have a particular anger when I see male bosses trying to jump in to represent women.

By pure chance you can easily end up with a team full of minorities or a team without any minorities by simply picking the objectively best candidate in each interview.  \nAlso in many stem fields 15% women is relatively close to the ratio of women graduating with degrees in the field(I.ex. for both computer science and for overall engineering degrees its 15-20% each) so again there is nothing unusual or negative about that.",
