  "post content": "So recently my dad (54) and mum (52) have divorced, and I wasn't surprised, however remained friends. After a week after the final divorce, my farther got  new girlfriend, (Sof\u00eda, 26). \n\nI wasn't mad but I felt like it was a little to soon, but its none of my business, how ever I told my dad I couldn't accept her as my new step mother as it was too soon and she was only 2 years older than me. He said this was okay, however he hopes in the future I can come around to it.\n\nRecently, my twins(we will call c&k, both 3) met my dads gf, however they clearly do not like her. They were asking me stuff like whos she, wheres abuela, and more.\nAfter she noticed my kids faveouriteising their biological grandmother, she yelled at me and told me I was raising my kids wrong because they don't treat her like that.  I told her they will eventually come around, however she wouldn't listen and kicked me out of my dads house. \n\nA few weeks later, me and my husband found out I was pregnant, and wanted to wait a while to tell my family, anyways, at the next family dinner, I told everyone the news. Everyone was happy for me and my husband, but especially my dad's gf. Keep in mind she still hadn't apologised for her outburst, and I still felt as I couldn't accept her, so when she started saying things such as, I cant wait for My grand baby, I felt a little uncomfortable but assumed she just liked babys. That was until she decided that if it was a girl then we should call her Elia after her grandmother or if boy then Samuel after her grandad, I told her no as I never even met them, and she was mad. She said I never took into consideration her ideas and that she wishes my stupid baby wasn't born\n\nI stormed out and messaged my dad saying I decided i will not let her see me, my kids or my baby till she apologises. \nI have gotten many angry texts from her and her friends, and one told me what she said, and she flipped the entire story.\n\nSo Am I The A-hole?\n\n\nUPDATE:\nSo I went out for coffee with my dad and sofia. \n\nShe apologised with very obvious fake tears. And my farther said he was sorry. Then I told them I will accept it however they are no to see my kids until they are oldenigh to\u00a0 decide for themselves. Sofia ew up and called me a selfish whore then my dad yelled at her and broke up with her so she stormed out. \n\nMy dad told me he to was sorry and can understand why I didn't want my kids to see him for a while, truth be told I needed him next week for a Babysitter , so I said its okay \n\nHe told me how no one can talk to his \nlittle princess like she just did no matter how old i am. He also said how he was with her more for the fact of it made him feel good he could still get woth someone.\nThat was 6 days ago now and I have since seen my farther 3 times and my kids have seen him twice.",

I get wanting hard to be a mom or grandmom but those things are earned and not magically granted because you date someone with children and or grandchildren. It would've been better if she were cool about the entire thing instead of forcing the issue and throwing a massive tantrum when things didn't go her way.   \n\n\nYour decision to block out such a big stressor until she mellows down is a prudent move!",
