  "post content": "Ok so this is annoying me .please bear with me first time posting and on mobile.  By accident I found a package and opened it as I was wrapping the kids gifts. A package had gone missing my husband had orders and had been for my Christmas. Now in that closet I keep a bunch of unopened packages my mum sends to my kids and then open them the day I wrap them. Anyway I open this package and it is obvious it is not for the kids. It\u2019s a self help book 12 rules to whatever .. I\u2019m like what the heck. The guy who wrote it is a phycologist  Who is a misogynist right wing nut job. Who my husband likes and kind of falls in line with his own way of thinking. (Yes this is an issue as I\u2019m rather left wing I guess) anyway so I tell him I found this package and accidentally opened it and he loses it saying how his name was on it and it had gone missing. At this point I\u2019m like wait , no no no the only package gone missing was his Xmass gift to me\u2026 so THIS was what he thought was a thoughtful gift for Christmas. Basically telling me I\u2019m a shit human and I need to change and this book will help. And he can\u2019t understand why I am so pissed and was crying all night and most of the day. Am I wrong? This is not a gift you give on a holiday. This is expensive toilet paper IMO. I\u2019m humiliated and embarrassed and hurt. Like I was so excited that he thought of me in advance and it wasn\u2019t a last minute Walmart gift . I\u2019m so upset. But Am I the asshole for not appreciating this thoughtful gift he got me ?\nupdate: and a bit more info. 1.Yes I\u2019m fact he DID say it was my gift. And yes he said to help me change. 2.when we met he was not like this or at least it was never apparent . It slowly became more of a thing then hit overdrive when he started watching throw guy. 3. I actually have in fact listened to him speak and find him intolerable. For many reasons.  All this said , after realizing he somehow fucked up (at least to my POV) he actually went out and got me some movies I wanted to see that we couldn\u2019t because of covid. A couple of Xbox gift cards to buy a game. And a uno type game \u201ccuz I like that kinda stuff\u201d so he made an attempt to make me feel better and happier and not be as much of an ass even if he still can\u2019t understand why I\u2019m upset. For those who keep saying I should just be happy I got a gift. I\u2019d have been happier without it. Thank you everyone for your judgment .\nFor clarity: I never bought him love languages I owned it and asked him to read it with me once and let it go after he said NO.  \n Also to respond to everyone hung up on my crying . Holidays are stressful as is. I had not slept almost at all for two days. Emotions were high and I was also responding to his yelling at me for opening a package BY MISTAKE.  So yes I\u2019m childish but honestly I also don\u2019t feel it was that over the top of a reaction either. I\u2019m human and my feelings were hurt. \nAlso I never at first mentioned the Author by name. So it was not me trying to start a huge debate about the guy or be bait or whatever. It was about am I justified to be upset about a self help book as a gift. That\u2019s the yes I\u2019m TAH or NO it\u2019s not about my remarks on the writer. \nAnd Lastly it was not a quick google search of him that I based my options off of. It was diving down a rabbit hole for hours and feeling gross after the fact. But FINE I\u2019m a chaos dragon I except that!",

That is obviously problematic on its own, and you really should consider talking to him and seeking couples therapy, but this being a *Christmas* gift takes it to a whole different level of selfish thoughtlessness.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you on Christmas.

This is a severe character flaw that cannot be balanced by any amount of good deeds or good intentions. It taints everything down to the bone. It makes every single thing he does suspect, a reflection back on him and his ego. There is so \"making up\" for being self righteous and callous to this degree. To cite a cliche, Hitler was a vegetarian. It meant nothing.\n\nA man who is gives a Jordan Peterson self-help book to his wife for Christmas has serious issues. A short list of them include: poor judgment, lack of empathy, lack of social skills, inability to predict the consequences of his own actions, racism/sexism/probably several other bigotted -isms. \n\nYou need to seriously consider your future with this human. He is unworthy of your time. Being \"honest and a hard worker\" is the bare fucking minimum of being a decent human being. It's not enough to choose a life partner. It's not enough to build a marriage on.

If either scenario is true, it's time to take those reigns back and eject those people from your life. Including this man. \n\nYou deserve better.",
