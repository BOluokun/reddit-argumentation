  "post content": "My (F27) best friend (F27) and I have been bffs since high school. We both came from a small town but had really large goals that we both, for the most part, have achieved. We moved out of our small town together and lived together as we both went to schools in a much larger state. I went to school and got my Masters in Political Science and my best friend (who we will call Michelle) went on to culinary school and has done apprenticeships all over the world and is a REALLY good cook.\n\nThe only issue I have taken is, since she's done all these amazing culinary things and has become so in love with food, she CONSTANTLY shames people for what they eat. She is literally incapable of not making a comment about any food. If you crave a burger from McDonalds, she will tell you how disgusting that burger is and about a burger she had in Ireland from a small pub made from lamb. Once I was eating Cheetos and she commented that she would never put that in her body and suggested I started making my own cheese puffs and that they are easy to make (they are not). Every meal we eat together, she comments on everything and will then applaud herself on the choices she has made.\n\nThe other day we went to a restaurant (it wasn't a super nice one, it was just a little hole in the wall sushi place) and our boyfriends came with us. My boyfriend is mostly a vegetarian for health issues and tries to stay away from meats, but will very occasionally eat fish. Last night was not one of those nights. He ordered a roll with solely vegetables and Michelle would NOT stop harassing him about not choosing one with any fish. I told her that she really shouldn't care what he ate and that she needs to just enjoy her meal. She then proceeded to talk about this amazing sushi she ate abroad and then said \"I have such a refined palette, I honestly don't know why you all don't just order what I order anyways\" and told my boyfriend that he wasted his money.\n\nI was kinda at my breaking point, so I told her she was being overbearing and kind of pretentious. This upset her, because then she told me that with my boyfriends diet and \"how I feed him\" she's doing him a favor. I asked her what she meant, and she said that I don't feed him the most nutritious or enjoyable meals. At this point I called her an AH and told her just because she's good at cooking doesn't mean she can be rude. Then I told her about all her political opinions that I think are stupid but don't comment on, because having a Masters doesn't make me entitled to shove my opinions down everyones throat.\n\nWe aren't speaking, but she refuses to apologize and I'm starting to feel bad. AITA?",
