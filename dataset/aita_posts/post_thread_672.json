  "post content": "AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?\n\nI (36m) used to run a company with my (35m) brother and both my parents. It was supposed to be the dream of the sons taking over the family business. I had the ability to work in every department, so over the course of the last 10 years I progressed to running the company. My brother, who worked harder than anyone else, floundered with any real responsibility. He was the ultimate task doer, but ask him to manage anyone or anything, and it would be a dumpster fire.\n\nMy parents would protect my brother by tying my hands behind my back in regards to saying anything bad to my brother about the quality of his work, or how he was failing at being a manager. My parents did not want his feelings to be hurt. My brother would get moved to a different department, or have his job description change so he wasn't in charge of anything that would hurt the company. They would never tell him he wasn't doing his job right, they would never tell him he sucked at his job. It was easier for  them to lie to him, so they could avoid any conflict or hurt feelings.\n\nI was complicit in this. I kept up the lies, I played the game. Resentments grew. My brother was still getting paid the same as me, I was running the company, at this point he was basically still in a entry level position. So 2 years ago I started a different company and left the family one. Less than a year later, my parents asked me to come back. I accepted on the condition that my brother would be bought out of the company. They agreed.\n\nSo with my brother being bought out, I am now running the company solo, we gave him a group of our customers that he now services under his own company name, life is good, or so I though.....\n\nI found out by one of my employees, that my brother has been stealing product out of our warehouse. They were under the impression that we had some sort of deal worked out with me because we were family. NOPE..... He was just plain stealing.\n\nSo when I confront my brother, he admits to stealing, but went off on this rant on how I never respected him, that I was the biggest asshole because I was mean, and on and on. So then and there I decided to stop lying, and essentially told him all of the lies from the last 10 years. How he got the short end of the stick because no one ever told him what he was doing wrong. How our parents just didn't want to hurt his feelings, but knew he couldn't run the company. I was done lying, I just sat there and told the truth.\n\nSo my parents are now mad at me because he's mad. Like MAD MAD, and he has gone no contact with them, and they are worried that they wont be able to ever see him or their grandchildren again.\n\nSo AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?\n\nEDIT: To add to more information to this story, it was not like my brother was thrown into a situation without training. We provided informal training on how to learn more about the business (Like this is how we do the books, come with me on the jobsite so I can show you this). Formal training both trade specific and management courses. He was not thrown to the wolves, he just never cared to pick it up, or try to step up. \n\nI left the company because of the toxic environment and all of the built up resentments.\n\nI came back to the company because my parents retirements are tied to the company and without a son to run it or a sale, they would have lost everything. I still run the other company I started.\n\nLast, I knew I was an asshole for what I did to my brother. When I told him the truth, I was also apologizing to him for my part in all of it. I was asking if I was the asshole for throwing my parents under the bus in the truth/apology.",

It might not have been done in the kindest manner; but then again, we'll give OP some slack given that kid brother was in the process of stealing from him.\n\nRegardless of what prompted the revelation, kid brother now has honest feedback on his performance. Is kid brother using that feedback as motivation to improve his poor performance? Hell no! Kid brother took his marbles and went home. Kid brother is never coming back to the playground. Maybe, just maybe, this surly attitude is why OP and the parents didn't previously give kid brother honest feedback on his performance? \n\nOP and his parents were likely not malicious. They probably hoped that, if they pulled together as a family, they could keep the business running despite the fact that kid brother was dead weight. OP and his parents probably prioritized family ties over money -- after all, they paid the kid brother the same amount as OP, despite the fact that OP is competent and kid brother was incompetent. \n\nIt is naive to blame this situation on the fact that kid brother never received feedback. The proof of the pie is in the pudding: when kid brother received honest feedback, he went ballistic. \n\nActually, the fact that kid brother is the type of person who thinks it is ok to steal from big brother is another red flag when it comes to his personality (he lacks integrity). Kid brother is a weak willed incompetent who was lucky enough to be born into a family where they carried his dead weight for years, paying him far more than his contributions were worth. His family did so because they loved him, not out of maliciousness.\n\nNTA",
