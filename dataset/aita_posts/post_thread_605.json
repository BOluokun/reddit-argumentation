  "post content": "I was very fortunate to be one of twelve S3 (14 year old) students from my local area to get the chance to go down and stay in Exeter college in Oxford at the start of the summer- all for free!!!\n\nThe experience was A-MA-ZING and the other eleven students (and the teacher's who drove the mini bus) who I went with are the some of the best and most friendly people that I have ever met. It was one of the best experiences / weeks of my life.\n\nSince we were the first students in Scotland  to have this experience- there is a chance that I  (along with the other eleven people) get to go back next year with a new bunch of S3s and do it all over again and guide them through it as we've already done it. I did say that it would be great to come back next year.\n\nDuring the last week of term my school hosts a range of trips to a variety of places such as Holland, France, Leicester and the North West of England and you get to go to theme parks and everything. All of my friends have decided that they will be going on a trip to Paris where you get the opportunity to go to Disney land for a few days, then you get to go to the Harry Potter studios in London and you also get to see a proper musical in the West End. \n\nNeedless to say... they are all pretty excited about it. They kept pestering me if I was coming. Initially said that I wasn't  going to but I thought it over and I know that it would be a very fun experience and I would quite like to go and have fun in le Paris avec mon amigos. \n\nI talked to my dad about it and he said that if I go to Oxford again I won't really be doing anything new (he never likes to go to the same place for a holiday because he wants to have new experiences) as it would just be doing the same things as last year with a bigger and new group of people. He asked me saying... \"Would I be standing in the Bodlean library thinking that I would rather be with my friends cracking it up in disney land than here doing the same thing as last year. \" \n\nMy mum disagrees and says that I need to think about it more and that I was one of the first to go to Oxford and represent Scotland. She did earlier state (before she realised that I might be going back to Oxford) to not put off going to Paris because of the \u00a3650 cost. But I think she would rather me go to Oxford. \n\nI just don't want to disappoint anyone either and to not be perceived as selfish as I am not a selfish person (I am a BFG).\n\nSo would I be the ass hole if I go to Paris with my friends instead of going to Oxford for the second year in a row?",
