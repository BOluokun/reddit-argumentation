  "post content": "Throwaway account, English is not my first language, I\u2019m on mobile - I apologise. \n\n\nI (27F) have been married with my husband (M32) for three years and haven been dating for a little over 5. My husband has this friend (F31) \u2018Mary\u2019. They\u2019ve known each other since they were in high school and she\u2019s considered \u2018one of the boys\u2019, if you may. That basically means she\u2019s always invited to all the fishing trips and stuff, which I don\u2019t mind at all, I trust my husband. \n\n\nWell, my problems with Mary started when she first found out I\u2019m half Romanian. It started kinda innocently, with her asking me to say certain words, teach her some insults etc which didn\u2019t necessarily bother me, but it usually put me on the spot whenever we were out with my husband\u2019s group of friends. It only escalated to her googling stuff about Romania and asking me \u2018are you a vampire? do you bite your husband by the neck?\u2019 to \u2018are you a gypsy? I bet you\u2019ve got some of that gypsy blood in you\u2019 (which is just blatantly racist)\n\n\nLast week, me and my husband organised a mini BBQ with our friends and Mary was invited by my husband despite me telling him she makes me uncomfortable. He said he had talked to her about her remarks and she\u2019s been understanding so it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll say something this time.\n\n\nIt was midnight and there were about 4 of us left and I accidentally spilled some red wine on Mary\u2019s jeans when I tripped over a carpet. All hell broke loose. Mary started saying that I\u2019m a witch and I\u2019m trying to ruin her life and this whole thing is part of my ritual and I\u2019m just a \u2018immigrant gypsy trying to ruin my husband\u2019s life\u2019 and I\u2019ve poisoned my husband against her. I started crying and profusely apologising. When she wouldn\u2019t drop it, I kicked her out and banned her from ever coming to my house again. \n\nAITA for doing this? My husband insists that Mary was just drunk and talking nonsense and he would talk to her. He also told me I\u2019m way too sensitive about my heritage and I\u2019m an a-hole for banning her. Mary has since given me a half hearted apology but I\u2019m still not ok with her.\n\n\nEDIT: I guess this is the update some of you wanted. Sorry I\u2019m still a mess and idk how coherent I am. We\u2019ve talked. He admitted to being in and out of an affair with Mary in the first 2y of our relationship and she wanted to win him back I guess. I called my mom to come help me pack some stuff and im out. Thats it. Mary can have him I\u2019ve been gaslit for years and it took a reddit post to realise. Oh the irony. thank you reddit.\n\n\nEDIT2 and probably the last one for a period of time: \n\n\n\nA lot of people seemed suspicious of Mary and my husband\u2019s friendship/relationship etc and have asked if I ever suspected anything. No, I didn\u2019t. Me and my husband had (or I thought we had) a very strong relationship, based on communication and honesty (guess it only applied to me). Also, Mary is very close with all the boys in the said friendship group. The other wives raised concerns in the past but they\u2019ve all been shut down by the boys in the group or by Mary herself. I guess I always respected their friendship group because they were very close for so long and it felt unfair to change that because of me. As far as I\u2019m aware, the other wives feel the same - plus Mary has been in a LD relationship for about 2 years and always claimed she\u2019s focusing on her career, she\u2019s too busy etc so none of us ever saw her as a potential threat. \n\n\n\n\nBut now it just makes me think there could be more to this story. But I\u2019m tired, as of right now, I am just exhausted. My Romanian witch blood won\u2019t let me live until I find out the whole truth but I need time.\n\n\n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to reply to my post, message me (even the ones that insulted me further - it was semi-funny) and thank you for the awards! I\u2019m sending virtual hugs to all of you! Ave\u021bi grij\u0103 de voi!",

We are very against the fact that Romani engage in child marriage. We don't like to be associated with this. We want to let them stay because they need to be somewhere, but we don't approve of some of the parts of their way of life. \n\nAnd you are also correct that the Romani people are not Romanian. They are travelers who mainly settled in Romania because Romania was one of the few countries that didn't kick them out and let them stay without citizenship. We are one of the only countries that didn't force them to assimilate in order to stay in the country. They have their own culture and speak their own language, though many I've seen are able to speak other languages at least a bit to get around. \n\nIt's hard to compare what the slur is closest to (definitely not to the N-word though), but I think it would be close to a combination of wetback and terrorist)",

That immediately starts a huge inequality problem.\n\nIt's basically like saying \"women cant be trusted\" which is horrifically sexist. Similar to the lie that anyone that's Bi-sexual \"cant be trusted to be monogamous\" because they'd forever have a \"wandering eye\" for the gender they're not dating. Do you see how damaging both of those are?\n\nHetero women can be in male dominated friend groups or fields of work without things going thirsty. We're humans looking for friends with similar interests, in places that most other women dont have an interest which skews the gender balance.

He needs to step in here...and speak to Mary, with you,  as a couple. You both need to make it clear, that non of this BS is acceptable. She is racist,  offensive, rude and being drunk is never an excuse. She is being nothing more than a toxic bully and that you both have no problem in removing her from your lives.  A friend would not do this to her friends wife.  A husband would not put his friend feelings before his wife.   Ask your husband which woman he has married. You are not playing mistress to her. She sounds like shes trying to play it to you though. Husband needs to stop enabling her behaviour and making excuses. Mary needs to step off entirely until she can learn to be respectful. Or not be welcome at all. Your house. Your rules. Do not let this go.\n\nEdit...just to add...what exactly do you think she would be like if you had children? They would have a mixed heritage....she going to potentially bully them too?  I can just see how this will keep going if you dont stop it....\n\nSecond edit...thankyou kind strangers for the awards x\n\n\nEdit 3: op I have just read your update. Im so sorry you had to find this out in such an awful way. You deserve so much better. Do not think the other wives and girlfriends wont be tearing her down over this, and your husband.

POOR IGNORANT MARY THINKS I'M A GYPSY WITCH THAT'S GOING TO CURSE HER! POOR FUCKING MARY THAT WAS RAISED SO TERRIBLY THAT THE ONLY WAY SHE KNOWS HOW TO WORK OUT HER JEALOUSY THAT HUSBAND MARRIED ME AND NOT HER IS TO BE A RACIST SACK OF SHIT! OF COURSE I'LL FORGIVE YOUR BEING THE SCUM OF THE EARTH BECAUSE BEING A MEAN, HATE-FILLED,  EXCUSE FOR A HUMAN IS JUST YOUR NATURE.\"\n\nThen turn to your husband and say \"Did I do it right?\"\n\nIf he's going to pick Mary's feelings over yours, maybe he'll have her stop coming around if she's the one who leaves crying.",
