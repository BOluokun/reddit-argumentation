  "post content": "First post/throwaway and on mobile, here it goes - for my sides guests the only children invited would be my nephews and two children that will be flying in with their parents and grandparents(my aunt and uncle) from another country. They are all roughly the same age (8-12years). I have big families on both my maternal and paternal sides. My mother is worried that my aunts and uncles on both sides of my family will be offended that their grandchildren aren\u2019t invited. Couple reasons I don\u2019t want to invite all the kids - the kids on my paternal side can be very bratty. Straight up I am not a fan of them. The kids on my maternal side are much better behaved even though they are quite a bit younger and there are a lot more of them. \nIf we were getting married at the usual hall that everybody gets married at and is quite inexpensive I think I would put up with the bratty kids and invite them all. However, we\u2019re getting married where the groom is from and it is five times more expensive and much more \u2018posh\u2019. I know that you\u2019re not supposed to look at how much money you might make in gifts, but you hope to recoup some of the costs for at least the meal in wedding gifts. I know that we\u2019ll end up in the hole paying for the families with kids. That might make me the asshole just for thinking that. I\u2019m trying to save costs by cutting cousins kids from my list . . . Here\u2019s the kicker my fianc\u00e9 included kids on his list - there are about 5-6. He is convinced that his guests will cover the costs of their kids IF they decide to bring them.  I know that some of my cousins already intend on bringing their kids as they\u2019ve already made comments about getting their kids new outfits even though invites haven\u2019t gone out (it was not the time or place to say no kids when this comment was made). I\u2019ve dropped hints to my maternal cousins that I wasn\u2019t including cousins children and they seem fine with it and understanding even when it was explained that the out of country kids would be there. Again my mom still thinks that it will ruffle feathers if there are kids on fianc\u00e9s side but not mine. My fianc\u00e9 who is not as frugal as I can be thinks I should just invite them all. So if you made it this far and can get through the family tree . . . Would I be the asshole for standing my ground? (Invites haven\u2019t gone out yet - but will be soon)",
