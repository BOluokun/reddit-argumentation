Going around me, where is more of a hassle then going by me. To top it off we had another conversation. \n\nMe: are you ok? Like do you have any flu like symptoms. \nHer: No why? \nMe: well I've been gone for three days and i was just checking up to make sure you're ok. \nHer: Thats a strange question to ask out of the blue. You shouldn't be asking that. People don't just ask that randomly. You're the one whose been calling in. I've been here at work, working. I'm fine. \n(She says this flailing her arms around and with a annoyed, aggressive voice.)\nMe: why are you being so aggressive? Im only checking up on a friend. \nHer: you do that if they been gone for a long while. \nAnd if you ask anyone randomly they will think your not normal. \nMe: i might not be. I told you i don't feel normal, your the one saying its part of growing up. \nHer: well your right, your not normal. \nMe: thank you for finally saying it. (I say to her as I walk back to my area.\n\nSo am i the A- hole for checking up on a friend after being gone for three days. \n\nBonus: is it A-holish to ask \"are you ok? To random people?",

      "content": "NAH\n\nAfter reading your last post, I think the theme here is that this person doesn't like how you communicate, and your conversations end up focussing on the small details, and then pivoting broad, overarching concepts (double checking a bag to one of us is a liar, checking on her symptoms to whether or not you're normal). \n\nI don't think you have compatible communication styles.  I'm also getting the feeling that you might not be neurotypical (neither am I), and she feels like she is in a position where she has to teach you how the world works? Just from the three conversations you've posted (two in the last post), and particularly around the 'not normal' language in this post. And I feel like she doesn't want to have to teach you how the world works and she's exacerbated by this dynamic she's in. \n\nI don't think either of you are wrong, it just sounds like a series of unsuccessful conversations.",
