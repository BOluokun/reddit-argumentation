  "post content": "My dad [54] had a major heart attack last year in November. It was major enough that a hole ended up forming in his heart, and the doctors at the time gave him a slim chance of surviving. Well, my dad did, thankfully, but still has one blockage that needs to be looked at. He is home now recovering physically from the ordeal. \n\nAs expected, the doctors put him on a strict diet. He has to avoid foods that evolve too much sodium, fat, sugar, etc. Basically, all the bad stuff. The doctors gave him a limit as to how much he could have a day, as well as gave him only one cheat day a week. This has been affecting my dad as he loves food. For reference, he used to be a smoker before his heart attack. But after his surgery and everything, he no longer desires a cigarette. But he says he doesn't miss it, but he says one thing that he does miss is food.\n\nHere is the issue. He mentioned to me that he wanted to go to Waffle House so he could have something other than cereal. I was hesitant, even though he said that he would order eggs, grits, and toast. I thought that if he ordered, then he might surprise me and get hash browns or something. So I told my stepmother that he wanted to go as she had a more say in the matter. She said that he could, but he would have to tell the waiter to avoid putting butter on the toast and grits (she believes they automatically put butter on things while cooking). This discouraged my dad, and now he no longer wants to go to Waffle House. \n\nI knew this would happen, which was why I told my stepmother. My dad tells me that I shouldn't have told my stepmother anything. Said that I should have kept it a secret and that maybe he could live a normal life. He mentions how he feels like my stepmother and I are controlling him too much and not allowing him to choose for his own. He says that we are in the wrong for that. \n\nMy dad loves food. Begs for Whoppers and BigMacs, but...the doctors put him on a strict diet for now. I just don't want to lose my dad. I already lost my stepfather and grandfather last year, and I don't want to lose another. I know he will eat whatever he wants once he is clear to drive. We won't be able to stop him then... but for now, I want to keep tabs on it. Especially since he still has a blockage. But what he says makes sense. Technically, we can't stop him from doing what he wants. If he wants to eat unhealthy foods and potentially risk his life once more, then he can. After all, that's his choice. But I want to keep him around.",

And doctors are really good at insisting these type of changes must all occur immediately.  With some people the doctor\u2019s dire warnings are enough to make them change their life completely.  For others, they may never change.\n\nYTA because you are falling into the typical trap adult children often fall into when their parents have health problems.  You start treating them like a child.  I know from personal experience this never works.  He is an adult.  You can encourage him to eat better but you cannot police your dad\u2019s eating habits.  He is an adult.  He knows the risk he runs.  He may think that since he stopped smoking, he may have already sacrificed enough.  He may make gradual changes to his diet.  He may not do enough in time and he may suffer another heart attack.  But you cannot lecture him, you cannot police him, you cannot forbid him, you cannot gang up on him, and you cannot tattle on him.  If you do, he will get angry and he will be justified in doing so.  Just love him.  Be there for him. That\u2019s all you can do.\n\nYour dad evidently quit smoking.  That is a huge adjustment and he should be proud of that.",

I am assuming that your father is on the standard medications given after a big heart attack. These medications play a big part in improved survival so he needs to take them as prescribed. Consider helping him fill his pill boxes and set alarms on his phone to remind him to take the meds. It is also important that he follow up with his cardiologist so ask if you can help him make those appointments (eg drive him, accompany him etc). Cardiac rehab also improves survival so join him for walks/exercise as recommended by his rehab person. When it comes to food, eat healthier yourself and share that food with your dad. Additionally, a big part of post heart attack recovery is dealing with the psychological effects. Many people get depressed or anxious so be a good listener and if need be direct him to see a doctor/counsellor. Bottom line: help facilitate things that have been proven to improve survival. Make it the easy default if you can. After that it is up to your dad to choose what he'd prefer.\n\nIf you help out in these ways you'll know you've done your best to help even if he chooses more problematic actions.",
