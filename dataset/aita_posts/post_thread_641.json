  "post content": " Me \\[33F\\] and my bf \\[32M\\] have been together 2 years. When we met he was living with his parents\\*, and I was new to the area with a 1-bed apartment. I work an office job, regular 9-6 + occasional weekends for deadlines. He\u2019s a freelance arts teacher, part-time hours, and they can be at a different school every day. His salary's not 100% stable, but on average I make about 3x his wage. The rent on my place eats about a third of my salary.\n\nHe's such a sweet, creative guy and I fell for him from the first date - we're inseparable and he's been staying at my place 5 nights a week basically from the day we hooked up. 2 mornings a week he teaches at schools near his parents' place, and so those days he sleeps back with his folks otherwise he'd have to get up like an hour earlier if he stayed over with me. It sucks 'cos I want to go to sleep next to him every night, but nobody wants to get up at 5am, so I don't feel emotionally abandoned or anything by this.\n\nBut: in these 2 years he hasn't contributed a cent of rent. He contributes \"in kind\" a bit - cooks maybe a couple of meals a week (I can't cook, we dine out for the rest), does the washing up (though not very well, grr). Meanwhile, he pays rent to his parents for those 2 nights a week, whereas he's in my apartment 5 nights a week. So, the other day we had That Conversation: I said that I want us to live together officially, I want us to be a household, and that means him making reliable contributions. I don't need his money to make rent, but, I guess... I want his commitment, his investment? Idk if that makes sense. If we split the rent 50/50 that would be 1/2 of his salary going to rent, 1/6th of my salary going to rent.\n\nI thought this was entirely reasonable - romantic, even, we were finally going to have Our Home, not just My Home!\n\nWell. Nope. I got a lot of pushback. \"I'm so poor compared to you, it's not fair that you're asking for 50/50 when you make so much and I make so little\"; \"I'd still have to send money to my parents\\*, they're my parents, I can't just cut their income stream without warning\"; \"If I have to pay rent I'll have no savings or security!\"; \"If I do this, you'll pay for us whenever we go out to eat right? I won't be able to afford to go to restaurants or movies with you otherwise\"; \"You'd be lonely if I didn't come over, I\u2019m doing you a favor\"\n\nI was astonished. I was crying by the end of the conversation. I don't feel like I'm asking for something unreasonable. I'm not asking him to start contributing to my saving-to-buy-a-house fund that I hope he'll live in with me one day, I'm just asking for an equal split of the month-by-month, fundamental price of keeping a roof over both our heads. AITA?\n\n\\*(As I get to the end it occurs to me that it might be relevant to specify that he's Asian, so the whole lives with parents beyond 18 / sends money to parents thing is sorta the default for him)",

It\u2019s totally fine that you want him to contribute but perhaps it would be more fair for you to pay something more like 2/3 and he pays 1/3\n\nHe obviously reacted too intensely. It doesn\u2019t sound like he was willing to talk out options\n\nEdit: you should discuss all the options with him. If you guys want to move it together then it might make more sense to live closer to his job so his commute isn\u2019t so bad.",

Maybe she should let her BF rent a place on his own, and then she move in and pay only half the rent then. I think I understand that she wants someone who is a bit more serious about earning income as well, so they can enjoy the finer things in life, rather than her working and resenting him putting his feet up and sending photos to her of that (if you read her other comments)\n\nEdit - just wanna add that they need some counselling and arbitration.

They should definitely split the cost according to income, but there are some things the BF should offer to pay for, or make it a goal to make more money within a couple of years. Even if you split it by income, it doesn't make sense to only put a couple hundred dollars in for rent when your partner has already been supporting you for years and you continue to expect your parents and partner to put in the work and money for your lifestyle choices. Sounds more disgusting to me than figuring out a way to pay more towards the household or bills.",

In my situation, I would be paying 77% of total housing costs, they would be liable for 23%. \n\nYou have to look at it this way; it was not his choice to rent out the apartment you live in. He might\u2019ve wanted to live somewhere more affordable. When we look for apartments again in the future I expect my SO to contribute a maximum of 30% of their income (arbitrary recommended budget proportions you can find online dating back to an economic crisis). So for him I wouldn\u2019t expect him to ever pay more than $450/mo towards housing (rent+utilities). We are moving states at the end of the year and my rent will go from $2260 to 1000-1600 depending on what we choose. Let\u2019s say we go for a place that\u2019s $1300 (my target).  That means he would only be putting forward $300 towards rent, I\u2019d pay the other $1,000. If I wanted to go rent a place for $1900, which means per this analysis he would owe $560/mo (presuming $200 utilities) I would in no way make him shell out the extra $110 that exceeds his budget. It\u2019s my choice to contribute more towards rent to afford something more. \n\nIt makes zero sense that because he moved in that you should suddenly get a massive cost break bringing you down to 17% of your income going towards rent and him 50%. HUD defines anything above 30% of your income towards rent as \u201ccost-burdened\u201d and anything 50%+ as \u201cseverely burdened\u201d. \n\nYou\u2019re asking you SO to be put into an extremely rough financial state while you live extremely comfortably.

But to expect someone who cannot afford your lifestyle, to pay for said lifestyle is crazy. As I said in my response - they can find an apartment where he can afford half the rent (after he gets a full time gig). Make it more extreme. Let\u2019s say I live in NYC, I pay 10K in rent because I have a really successful job as a lawyer at a big firm, you went to college and work full time but make 20% of the salary that I do. You\u2019re saying you\u2019d pay $5K/mo for the right to live with me as a couple??? It\u2019s unreasonable at the income levels present in the argument. \n\nIf they were closer income like one made $60K and the other $75K I\u2019d understand you might want to split rent, and they may be able to come to a decision there. But he\u2019s making something like $15K/yr probably and she\u2019s making $50K. Her rent costs a full year of salary for him right now. \n\nMove to a cheaper place where he can afford to be your roommate and pay 50/50 if that\u2019s what she wants, or don\u2019t let him move in.",

You're not unreasonable for wanting/expecting him to contribute, but you went about it in the worst way.
