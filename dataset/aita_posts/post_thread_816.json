  "post content": "I (F 25) have been in a relationship with my fiance (M 25) for 7 years. We were best friends for 3 before we became a couple. The first year dating sucked, he cheated on me a lot so we were very off and on. My friends really didn't like him, understandably.\n\nFor the past 6 years, it has been very happy and healthy. We've worked a lot on healthy communication and the relationship has improved because of it. He helped me find ways to cope with my depression, anxiety, and anger management. Both of us grew up in poor, abusive homes and we have both helped each other face that reality and move past it to become better people. We have been through a lot together, and we have grown up together. He proposed, I said yes, and our wedding is planned for the summer of 2021.\n\nThis weekend I went to a b-day party for my BFF's kid. Several of her boyfriend's friends were there. After I left the party, three of these friends approached her to ask about me. She texted me to tell me, and we laughed about it. The conversation quickly turned sour.\n\nMy friend told these boys that I was engaged but that \"I don't like her boyfriend so you can try to steal her away if you want (crying laughing emojis)\" I said that she had no reason not to like him anymore as he had grown a lot. She said \"Yeah I know. But I just think he's a dufus.\" I kind of exploded and said that I'd been in a loving relationship for almost a decade and that I didn't appreciate my best friend encouraging strangers to steal me away from the person I want to marry. She said \"It was just a joke.\" I told her regardless, I love him and he loves me and it really hurts that my best friend is unsupportive of my happiness. She never responded, and hasn't since.\n\nI told my fiance about this and he found it really upsetting, naturally. He knew she didn't like him at first but had thought he proved himself to be \"worthy\" and that they were on good terms now. He said he doesn't want to see her anymore if that is the way she feels about him. I completely understand as I would feel the same way if one of his friends said they didn't like me after all this time.\n\nI have been festering about this conversation since. It makes me angry that she would talk about my relationship that way to strangers. It hurts even more that after I told her how it made me feel, she didn't even care enough to apologize. I want to revoke her place in my wedding as a bridesmaid. My fiance told me I might be overreacting because I am angry and that I should wait to see if she apologizes. The way I see it though, the woman doesn't like my fiance, she doesn't respect my happiness, and because of that, she has no place standing beside me when I marry him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My best friend told me she didn't like my fiance and wanted someone to \"steal me away.\" He cheated on me 6 years ago but we've been happy since. I feel she is unsupportive of my happiness and now I don't want her in my wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: So it was the general consensus that my friend's comments were rude, but that I definitely overreacted in this situation. I sent her a long text apologizing for my overreaction. I explained that her comments were really hurtful and while I didn't expect her to like him, I did need her to recognize that I was happy now and respect that, and not trivialize it with jokes about how she wanted me with someone else. I have also asked her to refrain from making comments about how she doesn't like him around me, because it makes me feel like shit. She said it was okay, and that she gets it and understands how I feel. I am feeling better about the whole situation, and a little silly for my petty angry reaction to the whole thing. Thank you all for judging me!",

After I left the party, three of these friends approached her to ask about me. She texted me to tell me, and we laughed about it. The conversation quickly turned sour. \n\nMy friend told these boys that I was engaged but that \"I don't like her boyfriend so you can try to steal her away if you want (crying laughing emojis)\" I said that she had no reason not to like him anymore as he had grown a lot. She said \"Yeah I know. But I just think he's a dufus.\" I kind of exploded and said that I'd been in a loving relationship for almost a decade and that I didn't appreciate my best friend encouraging strangers to steal me away from the person I want to marry. She said \"It was just a joke.\" I told her regardless, I love him and he loves me and it really hurts that my best friend is unsupportive of my happiness.
