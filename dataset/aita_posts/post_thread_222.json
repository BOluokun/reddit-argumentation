  "post content": "\nI am in college and I have a 2 person dorm to myself after my roommate dropped out last semester. So when something was put on my dorm room door, I know it was aimed at me.\n\nAnyway, I was getting ready for bed a few nights ago, and I heard a bunch of giggling and bumping right outside my door. I looked out the peep hole and I saw these two girls who room together on my floor giggling, looking really drunk, and sticking something to my door. They were having trouble doing it because drunk...\n\nI had my phone on me and I put it up to the peephole and took a picture through it because I felt like something nasty was going on, from the way they were giggling about me being trailer trash, and I really didn't feel like having some confrontation, I had an 8 am midterm and wanted to sleep. The picture came out... Unflattering, to say the least.\n\nSo anyway a few hours later, I got up out of bed to use the bathroom and saw that the thing on the door was the \"trash\" sign from the trash room where the garbage and recycling goes in the building.\n\nI was put off by that, there's honestly been a good bit of bullying going on in my dorm and the RAs don't really care. I haven't been the subject of it before but a girl I'm friends with has been treated like shit by a couple people on the floor and the RAs of the building don't do a thing but give platitudes like \"oh there's two sides to every story\" \"oh adjusting to college is hard and things can get tense living close by\"\n\nSo I didn't really think the RAs would do anything. I took a picture of the sign.\n\nThe next day, after my exam was done with, and I had some time to think about what I wanted to do, I decided to post the picture of my door, and the picture of the girls taping up the sign, on my dorm's Facebook page.\n\nIt's a page usually used to organize events and such, but here's what I posted.\n\n\"Jane Doe and Jen Schmo put this trash room sign on my door last night, calling me \"trailer trash\" while they did it. \n\nBut all I'm thinking right now is that this kind of nastiness and bullying is trashier than any damn thing I ever saw in the trailer park I grew up in. (No, I'm not ashamed to say that) \n\nNo amount of money can buy class, I guess..\"\n\nAnd this has kicked up a big fuss, like a lot of arguing in the dorm, which I've mainly steered clear of. And my RA was mad I didn't tell her, to which I said \"oh so you could do nothing at all like you've done when (my friend) gets disrespected and bullied? Lol nah\"\n\nShe was pissed I said that too, saying that the school has a disciplinary procedure that doesn't involve public shaming. I was like \"well, you could of fooled me.\"\n\nAITA for how I posted the pictures and called them out?",

Many teachers do care, but are forced to work within crappy systems and adhere to bully prevention policies that don't work.\n\nIn most schools, bullying programs treat, kids that have conflict with one another, occassional rudeness/meanness, behavior that is the reaction to ongoing bullying, and actual bullying as all the same thing. That dilutes the effectiveness of any efforts, because everyone is a bully and everything is bullying.\n\nGet tormented for a year, and finally tell your bully to go fuck himself? Guess what, now the school labels  you as a bully.\n\nTwo kids have a bit of beef with one another, but neither is actually a bully. School labels them both as 'bullies'.\n\nNext is the fact that most bully programs are based around the idiotic notion of reconciliation. That means that victims of bullies get to sit down with them, and try to find out ways that THEY can get along better with the person who's been tormenting them. Which is absolutely fucking stupid. In what other situation would you make a victim sit down with their attacker and figure out how to get along with them?\n\nLike i said, dumb. But teachers are forced to work within them. Most teachers I know absolutely hate it, especially when they are forced to give the victim of bullying a referral for defending themselves.\n\nThen there's the issue of social manipulation. Teachers are just as easily subjected to this as anyone else. Bullies know how to turn on the charm, and are usually very smooth in a social sense. They often target kids who struggle with emotional regulation, the kids they know they can needle until they get a strong reaction. Or just normal kids who hit their breaking point. But, because teachers are just as taken in by this kind of manipulation, they often see the bullies as well-spoken, charming, and popular, and the victims as maladjusted kids who just need to stop being so awkward/emotional/angry.",

Think about how ignorant it is to assume teachers as a whole don\u2019t give a shit because you\u2019ve read or heard about some that don\u2019t.

I know it\u2019s human nature to equate the majority with the minority we know about, but try to think more critically. \n\nDepending on the size of the school there could be as many as a couple dozen or more teachers in each. Depending on the size of city there could be as few as one school for all ages or as many as multiple for each age bracket. Class sizes are up over thirty students in each classroom in major population centres. Teachers with a full class load can have upwards of 120-150 students a day. Obviously some might be repeats if they\u2019re teaching multiple subjects, but you get the point. Some bullies are extremely adept at not being caught and even ingratiating themselves to the teachers. That doesn\u2019t mean the teachers don\u2019t care, just that they may not see. And often teachers have their hands tied if they don\u2019t witness the bullying directly. I\u2019ve often been forced to address issues with the entire class, rather than the individual, when I have no immediate proof something happened. It would be ridiculous to assume that because some teachers either don\u2019t care or are just oblivious all must be the same.",

I know that, personally, my opinion of how teachers handle bullying didn't come from movies or newspapers; it was personal experience as a bullied kid going to every single teacher and school admin I could contact to ask for help, only to be turned down every single time. I only stopped being bullied when I fought back against the guy who'd been bullying me relentlessly for year and broke his nose - but of course, then I was punished for it.\n\nJust like police screeching \"just a few bad apples!\" while actively protecting cops who kill innocent people, educators don't get a free pass for systemic issues that cause bullying. \"Zero tolerance\" rules are the most pro-bullying rule imaginable, yet they are the norm in schools, *criminalizing being a victim.* School administrations famously avoid taking any side when bullying happens (unless the bully is the son of someone rich, famous, powerful in the community or who gave money to the school, then the school will actively side with the bully), and teachers who let bullying happen just because it would be a headache for them to save a kid are never disciplined. This is a systemic problem fostered and encouraged by the set of rules that you guys keep in place, not an isolated incident or two.",

On one hand, the two girls *are* bullies. On the other hand, OP's action can also be considered that of a bully - *according to the school*.\n\nIf you had first shown the evidence to the RA and, after coming to no satisfactory conclusion, then decided to post the images, then I would've immediately said that you were n-t-a for sure. Instead, you did it preemptively, without considering the fact that having had evidence of the girls' actions to present on this occasion may have actually incurred some disciplinary actions on your behalf against the miscreants. By going around the procedures that have been put in place, this would likely negate any possibility of it being solved properly because now the girls could point to your actions as being the actions of a bully. By not presenting it properly, they might suggest that the whole thing was fabricated from the get-go. (*This is not a joke - I've seen this happen several times to the victims of bullies.*)\n\nPublic shaming can work, true, but if you have evidence and decide not to bring it to the authorities (RAs) in place first, do not be surprised if, the next time you need assistance from said authorities, that they will be disinclined to listen to you since your actions not only shamed the girls but also would've reflected poorly on them if they don't take action against your actions now, which is a concern I have for you. No, that action would not be appropriate, but RAs are still people and can make bad judgment calls the same as anyone else. (Remember to **CYA** \\--  *make sure to keep records of any unseemly behavior aimed towards you now from the RA*. If the RA tries to bully you, collect that evidence!)\n\nI do find it understandable that you might have jumped the gun in your fervor to dispense justice on those who did wrong against you and your friend. I would hope that maybe having some sort of mediation between you and the girls with the RA can get this poor behavior of their's resolved. If they cause more trouble and you get more evidence, go to the RA first... and if the RA still won't take appropriate actions to get them under control, then you go the public shaming route and, this time, be sure to include the reason why you did so - ***that your complaints are going unheard***. After all, public shaming works on those who are authority figures too.\n\n# Still, NTA.",

We'd just laugh and roll our eyes. Then one day we were all going to some dorm event in buses and they were on our bus. As some point they started in with the clever \"woo woo!\" train whistle and one of their *own* friends - a guy who was casually dating a girl I knew from school - stood up on the bus and said, \"Listen, it wasn't funny the first time and it's still not funny so how about you STFU and sit your asses down\" and they were so humiliated they shut their mouths and never bothered us again :)",
