  "post content": "Hi Reddit.\n\nI don't want to go to Christmas this year. I'm a 30 year old and have been unemployed since 2019, but my wife makes enough money to keep us afloat. My family does a gift exchange every year, but it has always been extremely limited due to our financial positions. Normally we just get each other a simple gift or a gag gift, and something for our mom.\n\nThe cast here is my mom, Sister 1 and her family (2 children, husband), and Sister 2 and her family (2 children, husband). Some years ago the \"agreed\" upon gifting routine changed. Each kid would pitch in a few bucks to get mom a combined big gift gift, and the grandkids (my nibblings) would get presents. This would take place on the first Christmas I shared with my soon-to-be wife. It kind of sucked. Each household received gifts except for mine, because I don't have children. I'm 30, Sister 1 is 33, Sister 2 is 36. Their kids are 2-8 years old.\n\nThen for Christmas 2019, I sent a group message explaining that my then-fiance and I felt very left out the previous year. I suggested that they get my dogs gifts. That didn't happen.\n\nSo for Christmas 2020, I sent this message when Christmas talk came up in the family chat.  \n>So time for me to be a debbie downer. Last year [Fiance] and I were pretty obvious about feeling left out and suggesting our dogs got some gifts. Gave sizes, favorites, etc. That didn't happen at all and we felt pretty bad about being left out. Each other household got to take home gifts. It sucked.\n\nI was laughed at, gaslit about not ever mentioning it, and told, \"We don't even buy gifts for our cat lol.\"\n\nThe last thing I said about the topic was November 23rd.\n\n>Which is why we don't hold it against anyone from last year, but in the interest of not feeling left out and hurt we headed it off at the pass this year. I don't appreciate being laughed at about it, though. It's out there now, you know how we felt about last year, and are planning for the same thing this year.\n\nSpoiler alert: Every household went home with gifts last year, except for mine. It sucked. My fiance and I spent over $200 between the 4 kids and my mom, and received no gifts. No one knows it, and I doubt I will ever share with my family, but my fiance cannot have children. We might adopt later in life.\n\nSo after three years of feeling depressed after Christmas, even after telling them about it, I don't want to have it happen a 4th time. Once Christmas plans are mentioned this year, I will simply tell them I won't attend. We can visit friends or have our own celebration. My fiance thinks that's a bad idea, because they are my family, and apart from this whole issue, they're not terrible.\n\n\nedit: I had confused myself a bit, and tidied up the post to make some more sense. This started in 2018, not 2019. Between quarantine and unemployment, my long-term sense of time is messed up.",

What I'm actually reading, though, is that you're asking your family to show you a form of love and value.\n\n\"Stuff\" and \"gifts\" aren't how everyone feels and shows love, but for some folks gifts are extremely important. What you seem to be asking is for your family to demonstrate a kind of thoughtfulness and reciprocity that would be really meaningful to you, but your word choice is just rubbing everyone the wrong way.\n\nI'm really not sure you can pose this to your family in a way that \"clicks,\" for them - but you can try. Maybe...\n\n\"I know I have brought up before that come gift giving time I feel left out. I've actually been reflecting on this a lot since nothing has changed. I'm trying to be introspective about why this matters to me, and I think I have an answer. When I gift things to the kids and to mom, I feel love for them. I look forward to seeing their joy, and it's very meaningful to me that I can demonstrate how much they matter to me. I\u2019ve realized that what I feel *for* people when I give gifts is what I feel the same *from* people when receive them. It doesn't really matter if it's a big gift or a little gift or a gift for the dogs - the physical token that I've been thought of gives me the warm and fuzzies (odd as that might sound) and it turns out is pretty important to me. While I realize that shifting to a model of kids getting presents isn't that abnormal, I was wondering if we could reassess our gift giving and maybe find a way to add this method of showing love and care back into our holiday tradition for me as well? I'm open to ideas - it doesn't have to be gifts for the dog. Maybe a secret Santa amongst siblings and spouses with a $10 limit could be fun?\"",
