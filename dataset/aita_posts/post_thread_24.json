  "post content": "Okay, so anyone in the video game world knows that next week the new Legend of Zelda game comes out after like 5+ years of waiting. I\u2019m a massive fan. When the release date was revealed I immediately requested PTO for that date as I plan on staying home that day and enjoying the new game. What I didn\u2019t realize was that the day I asked off for is the Friday before Mothers day.  \nMy company has had to limit the requests off for that date now as many people have been asking off for it. I had previously told some of my co workers I was planning on staying home to play the game, and I guess word got around because one of my other coworkers asked me after work to give her my PTO so she can travel for mother\u2019s day. I explained to her that i requested this day off months ago for a specific reason and I really wasn\u2019t willing to change it. She got pretty upset with me claiming I care more about videogames than family and whatnot. I honestly don\u2019t really care about her not being able to travel because I feel like if this was an important date then you would have requested off early, like I did. Anyways I firmly told her no, but she told some of my other co workers and they are pissed at me and calling me an A hole for not giving up the date. AITA?\nedited typos",
