  "post content": "Not going to be very long here...my wife and I had our first child last August. We were lucky enough to have our insurance completely cover a certain genetic test that would allow us to find out the gender extremely early so we decided to have a gender reveal party (cliche, I know...). Well we invited a lot of friends and family to this, but one friend in particular said she wouldn't come because she was having trouble getting pregnant and that it was hard for her to be happy for us given her circumstances...no big deal right?...Fast forward to now...she is pregnant and all of a sudden wants everyone to be happy for her and wants to talk all the time about her child and expects everyone to be happy for her. Maybe I'm a spiteful A*hole but I'm having a tough time being happy for her.  AITA?\n\nEdit: Maybe I should have included a few small details. 1) I haven't congratulated her *YET* ...I fully intend to.\n2) We struggled to get pregnant as well. So I fully sympathize with infertility.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for all the responses. It's pretty clear to me that I've been the A*hole here. Trying to justify not congratulating a friend based on their past actions is petty and I am not going to be that person. Thank you all!",
