  "post content": "This happened a little while ago, but it did lead to a sort of split and a lot of coldness on the side of my brother and his girlfriend. So I wanted to get an opinion, looking back.\n\nAround my 16th birthday, there was a little comic convention happening in my state. I was super, super excited to go to this. A friend and I made plans to go together on the second day, my birthday. My older brother (20) and his friends were going for all three days of the convention and were staying in a hotel nearby. My brother was also going to meet a girl (his now girlfriend) that he\u2019d been long-distance with for a while at the convention.\n\nI showed up on Saturday in my costume, and my friend bailed on me. I didn\u2019t really have anyone else to hang out with at the convention. I went to go find my brother and his friends. I know my brother thinks I\u2019m embarrassing, but let me join his group anyway because I was all alone. I knew they were annoyed I was there and I felt really bummed out. \n\nThey all decide to leave the convention and go back to their hotel room. There are like 10 people in this hotel room. My brother and his now-girlfriend get on the bed and start cuddling and making out. Another girl and her boyfriend were making out on the other bed. The other 6 were just watching them, drinking. I was grossed out and I said something like, \u201cthis is really weird.\u201d My brother\u2019s friend said, \u201cif you\u2019re bothered, you can just leave.\u201d So I did. I went to the lobby and called my Mom crying, saying I was upset and wanted to go home. She asked why, I told her.\n\nI wasn\u2019t here for this but my Mom called my brother and yelled at him for ruining my birthday, even if he had just met his then-girlfriend. She also said his friend who told me to leave was awful (she just hates him in general because he kicked a hole in our wall once). My brother called me and apologized, but sounded mad at me.\n\nNow this whole thing colors my relationship with him and his girlfriend, who thinks I was a drama queen. Was I an asshole for getting upset, leaving, and telling my Mom what happened? He did do me a favor by letting me hang out with him and his friends.",

But also, I understand if your brother got upset since he wanted to hang out with his friends. I honestly can't really see the problem. They took care of you at the convent and then invited you to their party, you didn't like it and left. Of course your mother was upset at your brother, but it wasn't really his responsibility. Just sounds like normal family interaction when things don't go as planned.",

Its also safe to bet that their brother was the one who brought them so its not like Op could have just left the party to go back to the convention. What were they supposed to do? Wait in the lobby for a couple hours for their brothwr to finish? \n\nAnd I say Op was the brothers responsibility the second he refused to let Op do anything on their own if they weren't with them.",

That 'friend' was the one that ruined your birthday, why did your brother had to face the consequences? \nHe did the right thing by bringing you with him, letting you enjoy a part of the convention, rather than non of it.
