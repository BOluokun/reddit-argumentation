  "post content": "I (20M) am a college student in computer engineering. In my university the CE program has a bunch of pre-req classes that everyone has to take so we know most of our batch mates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground: There are very few women in the program and most students men. One of these women, Lisa is very girly in the way she dresses, like coming to campus dressed like a model, wearing heels. bright pink etc. I did a group project once with her and we became good friends and ended up leasing an apartment together. She is really smart, has a perfect GPA and is good in computer networking and some aspects of computer graphics. I have good skills in networking as well due to some side projects I do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not get along with some of the other men as when I hang out with them they get quite rowdy and say racist and sexist things that make me uncomfortable. They make fun of my friend and how she dresses behind her back a lot before they knew I was friends with her. Eventually since she was friends with most of the other women in our program, I ended up with a friend group that is mostly women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a hackathon recently and I joined after an acquaintance reached out to me. Some team members were one of these rowdy people I disliked but I agreed anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe day preceding the hackathon we discussed recruiting one more team member and I mentioned having a friend who is really good and whose abilities would be useful. I kept using the pronoun \"They\" and not she. I asked my friend and she was excited to join and spent the day practicing some things related to graphics shaders which could come in handy. I did not add her to the fb group chat and just had her show up to the event to sign up there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I got her to meet the team, the self appointed team lead, was like Oh we decided we just want to be a team of 4, since it would be too hard to coordinate 5 people. My friend was visibly upset but said she doesn't mind leaving since she did not feel like being in a team alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt shitty and said I could form a team of 2 with her instead. The others had a surprised Pikachu face when I said that, and asked me if I'm sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey needed networking skills for their initial idea and had to come up with a new one. We ended up doing something requiring the same skills as their original idea but that was definitely a different idea. However we might not have come up with that if I had not known their idea first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end their project was incomplete and we ended up winning first place. 2 of the team members were very mad at me and called me an AH, told me some nasty things about me being a \"simp\", white knight and saying we only won because of her \"pussy pass\" and that I probably did all the work. They said it was misleading of me to not say who the friend was and use the pronoun they instead of she when they knew the person. They claimed it was not about her being a woman just that she sucked.",

When you're trying to avoid conflict, is it conflict that will be inevitable? Is there a better time for this conflict to happen than now? When the conflict happens, how will you manage then? Once you've answered that question, can you get an equally good or better outcome managing that conflict now instead?\n\n\nAnd this is 10x more important when someone else would bear the brunt of that conflict.",
