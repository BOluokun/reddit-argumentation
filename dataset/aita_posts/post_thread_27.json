  "post content": "Before i M40 got married to my wife 33 we talked about every in advance. It was silly stuff at first. How we squeezed toothpaste, which direction the toilet paper roll should face, that sort of thing.  But as our relationship progressed we talked about more serious stuff.  How we would discipline our children, living wills, and what we would do if we knew we were having a child with severe special needs.  We decided together that we didn't want to do that to a human.  To bring them into the world to suffer.  We were lucky enough that it wasn't ever something we had to deal with.\n\nI had told my sister this because she is my best friend.  She went running to our parents saying that we were terrible people who would terminate a pregnancy that wasn't going to give us a perfect  child.  I never said that. We had to spend days explaining that we knew what we could handle and what we could deal with.  My parents weren't happy. \n\nWell, unfortunately, my sister 36 did not have this talk with her husband.  When she was pregnant with their second child the doctor told them that the child would have many health issues. They prayed about it and went forward with the pregnancy.  \n\nMy niece is nine now. And my sister now has an ex-husband.  The medical expenses drained all their savings. And he could not handle knowing that caring for his daughter was going to be something he had to do for the rest of her life.  \n\nWe just had Thanksgiving and my sister is having a tough time.  My niece is in diapers and will be for the rest of her life. My sister can't work because she would need special child care. No day care would do.  Prescriptions are hundreds if not thousands every month.  My parents are helping her but my dad has had to postpone his retirement to be able to give her money.  My wife and I help with about $500 a month.  It's not much but it still puts a hole in our budget.  \n\nMy sister wants to move in with me so my wife, who works from home, and my MIL who lives with us to help with our children, can help her with my niece.  We don't have room for three more people.  Or the budget to make out house accessible. So I told her that we are not responsible for her life choices. \n\nMy parents are saying that I need to step up and help.  Or that they will give everything to my sister when they pass away \n\nI told them that this was a great idea.  My family doesn't want or need their money and that they should set up a trust for her now.  \n\nI guess that wasn't the answer they wanted because everyone in the family is calling me an asshole for not taking care of my sister and niece.  \n\nSo I guess I'm asking if I'm the asshole for not wanting to be in a situation I intentionally avoided.\n\nEdit\n\nHey. Thank you all for helping me get an outside.view.  \n\nHere are answers to the most common questions.  \n\n1. My ex-BIL pays child support and spousal support.  And he spends a lot of time with my nephew, my sister's other child.\n\n2. She can't move on with my parents because they downsized as soon as we were out of the house.  \n\n3. It was a religious thing.  Her, her ex, and my parents are very religious. I used to be.  \n\n4. She is already receiving assistance from the government.  \n\n5. This one is painful to write.  Without going into details let me just say this, I'm relieved that my niece has so little brain activity that she can't actually be experiencing all the pain her poor little body is undergoing.",

I\u2019m sure they steered her toward abortion, for the fetus\u2019s sake and hers, and if she was religious as OP says, she refused to consider it properly. Now a child suffers because of her hubris in deciding what God believed, and so she suffers alongside her child. It\u2019s a hard life, harder than anyone who hasn\u2019t lived it will ever know, but people like her who choose that life and cry about their burden really piss me off. Like most of the other parents I know, we had no warnings about our disabled kids. We accepted what we got, and learned to live with it, and none of us had relatives giving us $500 from this one, and at least that much from another one. There were a few that offered through the years, but it was always people who were struggling themselves, and we refused to take their money.

And your wife, just because she's WFH doesn't mean she has free time, she's...working (certainly busy enough to need help from her Mom with childcare already). Of course to add in 3 additional people, you would need to do some **serious** renovations to find the space (if you even have it), plus accommodating the specific needs for your niece. That's a whole lot of very costly renovation work!! \n\nThen there are your children, who would suddenly have people living on top of one another, virtually **all** focus going towards your niece, it would hugely alter their lives, obviously yours and everyone in your current household. It's simply not a fair request of you. (Realizing too, this is a **lifelong** commitment for all involved! Your kids will grow, move out, maybe go to college, get married, etc. You, your MIL, and your wife, will all be in the same position from the day they were to move in, until...well forever, how is this reasonable to ask/guilt anyone to change the entire course of their lives?!) \n\nJust to add, the fact you gift $500 monthly is above and beyond already imo and should be much more appreciated. Those criticizing you, all seemingly with far less people and obligations in their homes/lives, need to step up if they feel so strongly about it. Frankly your parents should upgrade to a larger home, using the money they're threatening to will to your sister instead, by using it now. However, I personally think it's an excuse to avoid the daily demand it would place on them, which is hypocritical towards you. (I do realize your Dad has postponed retirement to help, I'm only saying it's not realistic to shove this all on your shoulders.) \n\nYou are absolutely **NTA**, yes it's a horribly lousy situation, but it's just not your responsibility.

But when it has a debilitating medical condition, as much as you love it, or rather, *because* you love it, you set aside what you want (to have your pet with you) and you need to think about quality of life. If the issue is bad enough that it is affecting the pet's ability to have a decent life, and treatment to make it better isn't an option, you have to do what is best for the animal. It's alive, sure, but it's not happy. What kind of a life is that? If you knew your pet was going to be stuck with a painful sad existence, would you have wanted them born?\n\nI wouldn't want to bring a child into the world knowing that it would have such a poor quality of life that they wouldn't be able to even function. I kind of think to do so knowingly is...selfish. I also know that this can absolutely tread into a scary ethical grey area of \"where is the line drawn.\" \n\nBut I personally think there is a huuuuge difference between having a disability that might hinder some things but the person is overall able to have a meaningful and functioning existence, even if \"nontraditional\" (like me, to a certain extent) and someone who is effectively a vegetable and will never be able to have a quality of life that is kind (like this poor girl). I feel like it would be kinder not to subject someone to that kind of existence.

We did have good coverage for her through medicaid and dual coverage insurance.  My husband and I both worked full time.  We did have 80 hours if nursing, 40 during the day and 40 at night which was covered by medicaid.  Not sure where you guys are from, but I would have her get a social worker and have them help with assistance.  My husband has had a vasectomy, but if I were to get pregnant again and the child had PCH, I would terminate.  We mentally can't go through that again.
