While I think that\u2019s pretty cool, during her cutting season she tends to eat a lot of bland, gross, strong smelling foods (think like eggs and broccoli, she eats a lot of broccoli). Now this not normally a problem for me because I have an almost nonexistent sense of smell due to 24 years of bad allergies. But when I can smell something with really strong odors it tends to make me nauseous (this is important). \n\nThe woman is in her cutting phase right now and shes kinda...smelly.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s body odor because I can\u2019t usually smell that unless I\u2019m right up on people and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s her eating at her desk because she\u2019s a loud eater and I haven\u2019t heard her eating. \n\nI think she\u2019s letting out silent farts because she always gets up to go to the restroom after.

But this smell is so bad that it\u2019s making me gag and cover up my face. \n\nI don\u2019t want to embarrass her but WIBTA if I got a air freshener for my desk and sprayed it whenever I smell the broccoli farts?",

I mean, super mild as in when I went digging around to find my inhaler one time it was expired by two years because I literally never need it since I stopped exercising hardcore. (Mine is exercise induced) \n\nBut now that I\u2019m wearing masks and my breathing is just a little bit harder, I\u2019m definitely reaching for my inhaler about 1000x more than I ever was before. My doctor has even added a second inhaler to my regime. \n\nI mean, you obviously know your coworker and how dramatic she has a history of being, but if someone told me that I magically have asthma now hat I\u2019m wearing masks, it would probably really hurt because these masks have legitimately made it just slightly harder to get air sometimes and my asthma just isn\u2019t bad enough to begin with that most people don\u2019t know I had it at all.",

I do agree that the masks make it harder for me to breathe sometimes but I just choose to go out less. \n\nAs for my coworker, I cannot say for certain she\u2019s lying about asthma. But she has never brought up asthma as an issue until she started talking about how the masks irritate her asthma and how she had to go to the doctor to get asthma medicine for her boys because the masks are giving them asthma. \n\nI would normally not bat an eye at this if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that she\u2019s one of those people that talk nonstop about herself and her problems and she is notorious for lying or making up problems to tell people.
