  "post content": "I\u2019ve (m32) been dating Siobhan (f32) for 6 months now. She\u2019s always been very vague about what she does for a living (sati things like writing and working from home writing) but recently, one of her friends mentioned something and I finally dragged it out of her. She\u2019s an author, she write and self published romance and erotica stories and novels and while not rich, she\u2019s able to make a living out of it.\n\nI googled her name and couldn\u2019t find anything so I confronted her about this.\n\nShe said she\u2019s writing under a pen name so I demanded she gives it to me so I know what she does.\n\nShe refuses saying she doesn\u2019t want it to be leaked even by accident and no one knows.\n\nI accused her of not trusting me and she still refused which was really annoying.\n\nI tried nicer approach and told her that I want to know her fantasies so I can try it out with her and she told me that what she writes aren\u2019t her fantasies but her readers and she\u2019s still not going to tell me.\n\nAt night I tried to check her laptop for her pen name but she changed her password before bed. I was annoyed and told her she clearly doesn\u2019t trust me and it\u2019s not fair because I have a right to know what she writes especially since it\u2019s a sensitive topic and I don\u2019t know her if I don\u2019t know her pen name.\n\nShe was furious I tried to look on her laptop and told me to go home. Before leaving I told her when she calls to apologize, I expect to get her pen name with the apology.\nShe called me an asshole on my way out.\n\nI thought she\u2019d call by now but she hasn\u2019t. My sister told me I was the asshole and I should apologize but I just don\u2019t see it and need. Second opinion. Was I the asshole?",
