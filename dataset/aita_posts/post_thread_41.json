  "post content": "Whenever I buy something out of the ordinary with a specific dinner purpose in mind, my husband manages to find it and eat it. I am sure if I was planning to bake something and bought yeast, I would come home to find him completely distended and surrounded in empty yeast packets. I usually stick to the same grocery list every week, and I feel like if I buy something out of the ordinary that is clearly an ingredient for a larger meal, he could at least ask before devouring it. Last night, I bought two baguettes, which I have only every purchased to make French bread pizza for him and our kids. I bought these at 11pm, and they were not even here twelve hours when I saw them on the counter, with the first six inches ripped off of each loaf, scanned the house, and saw my husband chewing. If it had been one loaf, okay. If he had used a knife, maybe. But the fact that he didn\u2019t ask if they were going to be for dinner and then ripped the top off of both of them like that final boss bloater in The Last of Us that lumbers out of the hole and rips the guy\u2019s head off, this is unforgivable. He insists I should tell him when I buy things if they are for a specific purpose. I say I am already taking on the burden of grocery shopping and cooking and the least he can do is ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: Some pertinent information:\n1) We have two snack cabinets that he is free to snack from, not to mention whatever\u2019s in the fridge.\n2) The bread was in a cabinet that is mostly ingredients.\n3) There was regular sandwich bread for the taking that was unharmed.\n4) For those who have stated that this is raccoon-like behavior, it really does feel like I am running a wildlife rehab operation, but the only patient is a 37 year-old software programmer.\n5) To the dude who said that my husband is going to \u201cleave me for another woman who will give him peace,\u201d tell me you\u2019re still bitter about how things ended with Sheila without telling me you\u2019re still bitter about how things ended with Sheila.\n\nUpdate: Wow, I was not expecting this to blow up, or for so many people to have such strong feelings about bread. Thank you for all of your input, especially my sister who unexpectedly chimed in. This may be the most validating experience of 7 years of living together. I shared this with my husband, and he accepts his AH status and apologized. We are going to work on communicating better, and he is going to work on his weaponized incompetence. He wants you to know he occasionally cooks rice and beans, and lately has been making us late-night quesadillas when the kids are asleep. But most of all: \u201cI was just hungry.\u201d -my husband",

How has it gone on this long?\n\nAs others have picked up on, it would seem that there are tastier things available to eat if \"I was just hungry\" was the true motivator, plus \"just hungry\" would explain eating one full loaf, even both of them, but does not adequately explain *half of two separate loaves*. That behavior, it's conspicuously destructive nature, is what suggests something more going on. And the fact that he still falls back to a \"just hungry\" defense suggests he's still refusing to be honest with himself and/or his spouse.\n\nI completely dismiss the possibility that this is due to stupidity, but I also think it is too deliberate for it to be mere selfishness. I think there has to be something deeper than that going on to act in such a way... One of the things I wonder is if he exhibits other instances of poor impulse control, but what I think is probably more likely and interlaces well with how childlike his actions are is that this is some latent response to being a kid raised in a household that was repressive in a similar way as far as what could be eaten and when.",
