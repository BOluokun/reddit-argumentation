  "post content": "Using a throwaway for privacy. Not giving real ages, but we're both in our 20s.\n\nI married my husband a year ago. Even though I've always had it drilled into me that anyone wanting to wait until marriage for sex is hiding something, I stupidly agreed to wait until marriage because I never learn from a single mistake.\n\nAs it turns out, my spouse is essentially impotent from childhood medications (ADHD). I didn't know the full extent of this until the honeymoon. Suffice to say that that honeymoon was one of the most depressing weeks of my life. We tried to seek medical care for it, but Viagra and other ED drugs wouldn't be safe for him to take due to some heart issues, which I completely understand.\n\nI was at first trying to hide the issues from family/friends but as things declined, I had to be more honest. He slowly stopped trying to show any affection to me, and we haven't slept in the same room for over a year now.\n\nMy mental state has been on a slow decline, so a friend of mine offered to have me come out to her state for the weekend to get away. I wasn't planning it, but while there, I ended up having sex with someone at a club. Sounds gross, but it was GREAT.\n\nOf course the aftermath has been very harsh. Most of my family understands that I'm extremely sexually frustrated and have been put in an impossible situation, but obviously a good deal of my \"social network\" thinks I'm a *slur*. They hold that with the exception of severe abuse, marriage is forever. \n\nI'd like to try to be okay with an asexual relationship, but honestly it's incredibly hard. I didn't marry to stay a virgin and sleep alone. I don't know if I have a high sex drive, or just A sex drive. I had a pregnancy scare from it and realize that I deeply want children one day, which obviously can't happen in this situation. \n\nI'd like to try sex again, but obviously that's not happening. I'd also love to have a sexual high without a crash of guilt afterwards. Everyone else gets that, why am I held to an unachievable standard?\n\nMy spouse doesn't want to accept an open relationship, not that we're talking much these days. In my state lack of consummation isn't reason for an annulment, so I'd have to prepare for a full divorce. I make more than he does and our condo is in my name, so he could take a great deal away from me.\n\nAm I really in the wrong here?\n\nEdit: \n\nI've gotten some preliminary advice that I should offer him a flat settlement to sign no fault divorce papers (say 10k plus I pay his moving costs, or even just a flat 15k). It sucks, but it would get him out of my condo quickly, prevent further legal battles, and end this quickly and quietly. With a ~2 year marriage, no kids, and the fact that 10k would about cover every financial contribution he made in the marriage, that actually looks like an amazing deal for him in front of any judge.",

The husband she was married to before she met me never wanted to have sex with her the entire length of her seven year marriage. She said they didn't even have sex on her honeymoon. She said they only had sex every 3 months or so only because she would get into a fight with him about it. If it was up to him, they would have never had sex.\n\nThis really destroyed her self-esteem to the point she was considering suicide. Instead, she eventually met up with someone from online and cheated. After doing so the one time I guess it gave her at least a small enough boost in self-esteem that someone would want her that she finally had the courage to divorce the guy.\n\nI didn't understand why she didn't just divorce the guy in the first place but if it was between her cheating or committing suicide, I would obviously prefer she do the former. I always told myself I would never get involved with someone who had cheated but in this case I felt there were extenuating circumstances. I figure if your husband doesn't want to have sex with you for seven years then it seems kind of messed up there should be any expectation of sexual fidelity.\n\nI feel like the same reasoning applies here. Just because the OP's husband can't get an erection doesn't mean they can't enjoy other forms of affection or sex. He could go down on her or give her a hand job at least and she could do whatever she could for him. If he's not willing to work something out with her and is completely ignoring her physically then the idea there should be an expectation of sexual fidelity after a year or more of neglect seems maybe a little unreasonable. My take is if he doesn't want her then he can't complain if someone else does. Obviously the correct way to handle this is to get a divorce, but I'm not going to crucify someone when they were misled going into a lifelong commitment. It's always wrong to cheat, but in this case I wouldn't go so far as to say she's an asshole.",

I have entertained the idea of cheating, but I haven\u2019t. Honestly my depression makes me not feel like sex anyway.  I want children as well.\n\nI know your hurting and I honestly think you shouldn\u2019t ave to stay in a relationship that makes you miserable. But that being said, I think your husband needs to see a sex therapist, he likely feels like he isn\u2019t a man, like he isn\u2019t good enough and the decline in the affection could be his self fulfilling prophecy. Best of luck with this complex issue.\n\nNTA",
