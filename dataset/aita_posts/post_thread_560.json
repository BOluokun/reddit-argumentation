I doubt her company lets her go for this, least I hope not. \n\nYou'd be an incredible customer if you acknowledge the issue, talk to her and tell her you're disappointed but understand things happen, and don't want to get her in trouble because this is her livelihood. Ask her to tell you if anything happens in the future, and I'm sure she would.",

She didn\u2019t even message me about it. I really don\u2019t want her to lose her job (although that might happen no matter what I say, I had to call her boss about the damage so their insurance would pay for it.)",

It's worth chatting about, have her present the info to the company to soften the blow, and have them call you to say you're frustrated but understand things happen.\n\nI don't want you to feel guilty for doing essentially the thing I told you to do, but I get the sense you're also looking out for her and I think it could be handled more tactfully to ensure her livelihood is protected.",

Bit of an established relationship with your current person who just had an accident this time and didn't handle it totally professionally. That happens. New cleaner might be worse and less invested, you never know!",
