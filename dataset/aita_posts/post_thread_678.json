  "post content": "Husband (56M) loves shopping.  This drives me (52F) insane as we have way too many \"things\", but if it brings him joy to have 37 cases of tomatoes and 8 litres of olive oil, whatever. We can afford it, so I just ignore his semi-hoarder habits and carry on. If this is the biggest problem we have, life is good.\n\nHowever... this sunny afternoon, the Sunday before Christmas, we were out for a nice day running errands.. UNTIL he suddenly decided to go to Costco. \n\nI HATE shopping - period. I especially hate Costco. Going on the Sunday before Christmas is a hard NO for me and I said so in a bitchy tone  as soon as he entered the zoo like parking lot because hey, I was bitchy about it ... who TF goes to Costco on this day - during omnicron surge -  unless they are insane. The parking lot was overflowing, can only imagine the inside. \n\nHe peeled out of the parking lot very angry and said IWTA for not sucking it up and going to Costco with him. He likes it and I should join him in doing things he likes. \n\nHe goes to Costco weekly for random shit we don't need, is retired and can go any day, any time, and without me. Every day of his life, alone, I DGAF. Or, could ask me to go any  quieter afternoon with him. \n\nAITA for not turning my frown upside down and enjoying F-ing Costco w him. He is totally sulky about this now.",
