  "post content": "So Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom came out today on the Nintendo Switch and I have been looking forward to, and planning for, this game for years. Zelda has always held a place in my heart where I can escape the mundane of daily life, especially as an adult who works a full time job, pays the bills, etc.\n\nNo kids in the household it\u2019s just me and my wife. Starting 6 or so months ago I told my wife that when this game came out I would essentially become and hermit and go into a hole for the entire weekend of its release. I would eat, sleep, breathe Zelda. I continued to reiterate to her my plans every time the topic came up and even more so as the game got closer to release. I took time off of work as I put this on my work calendar as soon as I knew the launch date.\n\nFast forward to earlier this week, I reminded her again that I would essentially disappear this weekend to do what I want to do which is to play the new game all weekend. She then plans a movie night with a bunch of neighbors for tonight, on launch day. I made sure to clean up the house, do the dishes and even did like 4 loads of laundry and re-organized the linen closet in preparation for this weekend. The time for the party rolled around and I took a break from playing, made all the popcorn and set everything up in our home theater for her and then went back to play my game. As guests showed up I welcomed them in and showed them the way to the theater room and continued to play my game. When the movie was over I greeted them again as they left and then I helped clean up the kitchen on another short break. \n\nFast forward to now, my wife is mad at me for playing my game downstairs while she hosted the movie night alone. She said it was weird and stupid that I couldn\u2019t carve out a couple hours for this movie night. It\u2019s just a stupid video game she is saying. I reminded her that I made my plans for this weekend months ago and that what I did doesn\u2019t contradict what I\u2019ve been telling her I would do for months now. So AITA for playing my new game while she hosted the movie night?",

Did she do this just to mess up your Zelda weekend with malice aforethought? If so, why? ETA 2 is this some kind of power play. \"I don't care about your Zelda weekend, you're going to do what I want!\" ?",

The result is almost always the shut-down partner stops sharing as much in general, and ends up hiding things because they don't want to expose themselves to that negativity.\n\nI see it in my in-laws all the time. My FIL has all kinds of interests that my MIL brushes off or puts down so he just doesn't talk about them anymore, and has stopped doing some even.

But why should i get upset with him spending one week out of many doing his own thing? There will be other Saturdays and other chances for sleep ins and i see him most nights of the weeks  anyway",

When the finale of the campaign I am the Game Master for was coming up, I told my wife that I needed her to let me be a hermit for the entire Saturday so I could prepare. I had so much to get ready for. \n\nAnd this was for a literal imaginary game.\n\nAnd this absolute queen of a woman not only gave me that time, but brought me a homecooked meal to make sure I ate because I had been working for 6 hours non-stop and staring at my computer. I was just going to subsist on cereal that day and she went out of her way to do this for me for the hobby that I loved.\n\nShe went on a weekend cruise with her girlfriends and I cleaned the entire house while she was gone, finally took care of that work in the backyard I had been putting off, and installed our new water heater. \n\nSupport your spouse's hobbies with love and they will often give more love right back. Treat them with disdain and take a guess what will be coming your way.",

Had to tease her a bit as she considered canceling session today so we could play more and I had to remind her that it's 4 hours and our players would be sad and also, like...today is 'give trauma to one of our players' day and he's been looking forward to it for two weeks so that did the trick. Dnd and Zelda today. Best weekend tbh.\n\nOn that note- Op 100%, not at fault, and I'm so sorry you're stuck with a spouse who power-plays you instead of supporting your hobbies. Have fun with TotK. It's been breathtaking so far!",

It was a pretty crazy session.\n\n**Long Version**\n\nThe Bard is a minority refugee who was separated from her mother when they were crossing the border to leave the Empire behind. She hasn't seen her mother for 5 years. The party is infiltrating the Empire to assassinate the Empress, so they meet up with the underground resistance movement.... and the Bard's mother is there.\n\nOne tearful reunion later that my players pointed out was very appropriate considering Mother's Day was a few days away, they're all sitting around a table together laughing and eating home cooked food.... when the poison in the wine takes effect.\n\nThe party is paralyzed while the Bard's mother stands up. She congratulates the Bard on a fantastic performance, but she knows she isn't really her daughter because she watched her daughter die. The Bard is obviously confused by this but cannot answer because she is paralyzed. And so Mother cuts her throat. Critical sneak attack took her right to unconsciousness.\n\nNext session they're trying to track down the mom because someone has clearly messed with her head and implanted a false memory. Our Paladin is very worried that The mother is being used as an unwitting spy to take out the underground resistance movement. As he put it during the session.....\n\n\"Oh shit, the machines are in Zion\"",
