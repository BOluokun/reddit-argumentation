  "post content": "\nMy partner has just come out of hospital after a 2 week stay in intensive care. We were visiting his family abroad (staying at his mums) when he became unwell. We have been here almost a month now when we only planned on two weeks.\n\nI have an almost 4 month old son who is exclusively breastfed so very much dependant on me. We were also unwell during this visit, which was frightening, exhausting and expensive as we needed some medical care. He is also having some sort of sleep regression so I'm only getting 1.5hr stretches of sleep at a time.\n\nEvery day I went to the ICU for two hours (between feeds) to do some of my partners personal care as he didn't let the nurses do it. This involved feeding my son in the hospital, rushing to ICU, donning protective clothing, tending to and reassuring my partner, then rushing back out when my baby began crying with his grandma. It was exhausting mentally and physically as I was still recovering myself, eating poorly through worry, breastfeeding and extremely hot on the ICU. \n\nMy partner is home now here and I think I might now be an arsehole as I've made the decision to fly home with my son on the 26th December. My partner cannot fly yet, drs orders. I'm sure my partner would like me to stay but I'm mentally and physically exhausted by these last few weeks full of worry, illness, sleep deprivation, back and forthing to the ICU and caring for my son single handed in a foreign country...in my partners mums home. \n\nMy partner will be here for an extra 3 weeks possibly longer undergoing rehab. I know he has missed me and his son while in hospital and it's been a scary experience all round. My son needs some medicine (not available here) and his second set of jabs in our home country which is part of the reason why I want to go home. But in all honestly I'm want home because I've been exhausted, scared and homesick...and now wondering if I'm a total A-hole for booking this flight.\n\n...........EDIT/INFO\n\nInfo: it's not a foreign country to my partner. It's his country of birth where the majority of his friends and family are. It's also where his long term Dr is.",
