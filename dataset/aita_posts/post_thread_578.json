  "post content": "So this isn\u2019t like a big tea spill, but I just really feel like a huge a**hole for doing this, so I wanted some opinions.\n\nI went to community college for a term, right before the pandemic began, and I made an awesome friend. She was cool and we did a lot together. I didn\u2019t have a job at the time because my parents insisted I should focus on classes instead of a job. But me and my friend talked about moving out of our parents\u2019 house all the time. It was something we really wanted to do together after we got jobs and after I got my license (she won\u2019t be able to drive due to a joint disability; she\u2019s decided it\u2019s not worth the risks).\n\nAnd then COVID happened.\n\nJust as I was about to get my license, the DMV shut down. I was so upset. This threw a BIG hitch into my plans to get out of the house. I\u2019d have to wait until the pandemic thing blew over and the DMV opened again. I skipped the next term, as it was all online and I\u2019m not good with online classes, but I stayed in contact with my friend. We even hung out sometimes (we waited until we\u2019d been isolated for about a month and didn\u2019t leave the house at all, and we still tried to use social distancing whenever possible). The dream of moving out together seemed far off.\n\nThen things started opening up again. HUZZAH! The DMV opened and I tried to schedule an appointment. But the DMV wasn\u2019t doing drive tests. They called me to tell me they wouldn't be doing a drive test for a new, non-commercial license. I was even more upset than before. I\u2019m still mad just thinking about it. I\u2019m a very independent person, and I wanted to be responsible for myself entirely. My friend wasn\u2019t super happy about this either, though it didn\u2019t affect her quite so directly. We just agreed we\u2019d wait even longer to move out.\n\nMeanwhile, I got a job! That was the best thing I could do to bring myself closer to moving out. I immediately started saving money, making sure I only spent money when necessary. My bank account was slowly but surely growing in amount and I was excited. First I could afford a car, and then, after I got my license and got myself to a financially stable point, I could move out!\n\nToday, she texted me saying she couldn\u2019t wait anymore. She needed out. Now. I was immediately hesitant. I told her I couldn\u2019t as I didn\u2019t have my license or a car or even really enough money saved up to last us very long. She said she got a job though! She made 1200 a month! She had food stamps! Surely, we could do it. I just...couldn\u2019t budge. Without a way to get to work, we would have to move back almost immediately. I wanted to be smart about this.\n\nI feel so guilty. She constantly feels like an outcast in her own home. I know she won\u2019t tell me, but I KNOW she\u2019s upset. Her reaction made that clear. Of course, I\u2019d *love* to move out with her, but the timing is all bad. Am I just being a bad friend? Am I the a**hole here?",

You, however, are being very practical about it, and you're definitely playing it smart here. It suck for her, but it's definitely the smart thing to do right now to wait until you're sure you have the resources to do it successfully.",

Not being able to move for awhile longer, or moving out, failing and having to move back home? If you don't feel you are able to do it, then don't. A good friend should be able to understand and accept when you say no.\n\nIs there any way to compromise? If not then that's fine, sometimes life happens, and plans get derailed by more then expected. Anyways, good luck on getting your license when everything opens back up!",
