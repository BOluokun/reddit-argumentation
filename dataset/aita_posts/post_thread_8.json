  "post content": "I (37f) do not permit Alcohol in my house, and I haven't for 15 years. There is a lot of alcoholism in my family and in my late teens/early 20's I was a problem drinker. Fortunately I realised before things became too bad and have not drunk a single alcoholic drink since. I don't object to others around me drinking, I just won't myself and don't want it in my house. All of my family and friends are aware of this and the reasons why.\n\nA group of my friends and I enjoy playing board and card games. We have decided to have a games night once a month, taking turns to host in our homes. The first two were fantastic and we really enjoyed ourselves. Some people were drinking alcohol, and others weren't.\n\nMy turn is coming up, and in making the preparation, I reminded people that I don't allow alcohol in my house, but if they wanted to bring non-alcoholic beer or wine, then that's OK, and I could make up a few different mocktails. I thought that would be a reasonable compromise and that people would be fine with not drinking for a three hour event.\n\nUnfortunately that was not so.\n\nTwo of the group were extremely unhappy with that. They said that whilst they were aware of my house rule, they just thought I meant that I don't have alcohol in my house, and that I wouldn't object to others bringing some. I don't know where they got that idea, because all events in my house they have come too were alcohol free (although I've only really hosted brunches and lunches where people tend not to drink anyway).\n\nThey also said that not permitting them to bring alcohol was inappropriate and showed I was a bad host and a bad friend.\n\nWe did end up in an admittedly petty argument, where they said that I was a hypocrite for not letting them drink, because I was practically an alcoholic at one point, and if I still can't be around alcohol after all these years then I needed help. I responded and said that if they can't go three hours without drinking then it was them that needed help.\n\nWe tried not to get the others involved in the argument, because we didn't want them to feel like they needed to take sides, but the argument ended up going from an in person one, to an argument on our friend group chat. This has of course led to people taking sides, even those friends who are in the group chat but don't attend the games nights. \n\nI'm thinking of withdrawing from the games nights because of all the fighting. I still don't want alcohol in my house, but other people have been saying that I'm in the wrong for not complying with our countries social norm of drinking alcohol at events and parties. Others have said that there is nothing wrong with me having boundaries and that people shouldn't automatically expect to be allowed to drink alcohol at every event. \n\nI don't really know what to think about it, because they are right that where we live has a huge drinking culture and it is more normal than not to drink at evening events.\n\nAITA for not allowing people to drink alcohol in my house?\n\nEdit: it's been mentioned a few times that people don't understand why I won't allow alcohol in my house when I am fine being around people drinking elsewhere, so I thought I should address that.\n\nA lot of my worst memories around drinking happened at home. I'm not even sure I can properly describe the pit of self-loathing and despair I felt when things were at their worst.\n\nI was also at home when I realised I had problems, and I felt so disgusted with myself and then so trapped that I left and stayed with my mother for a whole because I couldn't face going home. Some family friends cleared my house of alcohol for me before I went home.\n\nIt took a long time to feel comfortable in my home again, and when I did, it became my alcohol free sanctuary in a world where drinking is so common. I have this bizarre feeling that my sobriety is somehow linked to my home being alcohol free and am afraid that by allowing alcohol in, I will slip back into the hole I was in before. I also feel I can be around people who are drinking because I know I get to go back to my safe place.",

It took five house for them to find everything, and they ended up with one and a half bin bags of bottles and cans. \n\nIt took a fair while for me to learn to be comfortable in my own house again because I had such negative associations with my house. Eventually, I began to see it differently. Having it completely alcohol free was a large part of what helped, and it got to the point where I could relatively easily handle being around people who drinking, because I had my alcohol free sanctuary at home.\n\nI still have this extreme fear that bringing or allowing alcohol in my house will send me straight back to the person I was then. I have seen other people with similar issues relapse after years of sobriety.

It was the most intense, visceral feeling of dread. All of my memories in that apartment involved drinking. The mere thought of being left alone was enough to turn my stomach. \n\nWhen our lease was ending my husband considered signing another to save the hassle and cost of moving. As laissez-faire as I usually am when it comes to that sort of thing, I said with full conviction that we were getting the fuck out of there. I'm not big on \"vibes\" but that apartment just has bad juju for me. \n\nThese days we don't keep booze in the house aside from a bunch of expensive whiskey/bourbon (blech, never my thing) and the occasional six pack, but those are never for me. I've personally come to the realization that I CAN have just one or two, but only socially. A drink at dinner is fine, as long as I'm not picking stuff up on the way home. As long as it isn't IN my home. \n\nMy addiction is still there, waiting. It still tells me just about every day to go get a drink. It's fine, we're fine, we're doing good, one night won't hurt, it's right there, it's so easy, he'll never know. But I know. I know if I give in I'm gonna feel like shit. I'll have let myself down.\n\nI don't count days, I don't go to meetings, sobriety isn't my identity, and I don't feel like a failure if I have that drink or two. But I know what I'm capable of. \n\nStick to your boundaries. When they say \"but you used to drink a ton\" as if you're a hypocrite just say that it's BECAUSE of how much you used to drink.\n\nIf you don't care that they drink just host elsewhere.\n\nAlso, congratulations.

You can expect there to be alcohol there, but you can also not worry about it staying around you or bringing it home.

Think of it like smoking pot or cigarettes, you may be okay being around it, or even at somebody's home where they smoke indoors, however that doesn't mean you want it in your home. Excluding the smell portion of it, alcohol is a drug, and many simply don't want drugs in their house. On top of that, what happens if one of the party goers leaves their extra cans/bottles? That's a habit I've noticed at every party I've hosted, booze left for the host due to forgetfulness or a \"good will gesture\". OP seems to have a strong handle on themselves, but imagine they run into a drink left at their home on a really bad day, bad day just got worse because now they have to fight the urge that is always there with addiction, or it could even cause a relapse.",

Definitely it is your house so do you, but you probably should not have volunteered to host,  I do not drink. I get no enjoyment from it. Like I will have a glass of wine with dinner when I go on vacation to a country that specialized in wine (i.e the one time I went to Italy or to France) but in all honesty  it's just kind of being a bad host,  no one is forcing you to drink and if it was such a problem you would not have gone to previous game nights",

Part of the reason I won't have alcohol in my house is that I have such bad memories of drinking in my house when I was at my worst, I'm afraid that if I allow alcohol in I'll start drinking again. It's not the same when I am at other people's houses, though. I don't feel that same fear elsewhere. \n\nI don't know if that makes sense to other people. \n\nI remember the darkness I felt at the time and the panic and fear when I had that realisation that I had a problem. I walked out of my house and couldn't go back for a while. I stayed at my mother's for several days whilst some family friends searched for and got rid of every bottle of alcohol I had. \n\nDespite being sober for so long, I still am terrified that I'll slip. It has gotten worse recently because my family is in the process of losing my father to alcoholic liver disease.\n\nI am going to suggest a sit-down conversation with the other two people to see if we can get past this. If they agree, I'm going to try and explain more about why I just can't have it in my house. I will definitely suggest that we skip me hosting, and I can help someone else when it's their turn.",
