  "post content": "Dummy account because the relevant parties are on Reddit.\n\nI (31 F) am pregnant with a girl. My husband\n(33) has a younger brother (31) whose he's very close to. However I recently told my husband that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of his brother spending much time with my daughter\nonce she's born. It's not because of my BIL himself. We're not close but he's fine. The issue is his life choices.\n\nHe's not married, has no intention of getting married or having kids, and dates only for sexual purpose. He dates multiple women and the only thing he has in common with them is that, like him, they are extremely good looking. He's highly intelligent, yet he has no interest in meaningful relationships. I spoke to him about his choices a few years ago, and after accusing me of being\n'moralistic', he claims that he always uses protection and he never leads the women on. Which I call BS on, as I can't imagine\nany woman with an increasing ticking biological clock would willingly be in a relationship which she knows doesn't have a future. Not to mention, what woman would want to be with someone\nwho may not even remember your name in a year's time?\n\nI mentioned this to my husband, however he called me an AH, and said that it was ridiculous to limit our daughter's access with her uncle just because I don't agree with his legal dating choices.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I probably should have clarified that he generally goes onto apps like Tinder. Which makes it worst, as the women he dates tend to be of a certain type.",

That made me realise if I want to achieve every point of that list I should take a step back from casual dating and look for something serious. When I got chronically ill at 25 I decided to reduce the number and put the whole thing on the back burner. Good decision. My partner left me in the third year of my illness because I wasn't able to go to bars with him anymore and because when I couldn't bury the symptoms of my CPTSD in work anymore they broke free and the subsequent therapy made me stand up to him more. Well, bullet dodged. At 27 I decided I'd most likely not have any children at all. Now I'm 30 and moving in with my mother because I can't always care for myself. I'm glad there are no children I'd burden her with and whose care would wear me out beyond my strength. I don't know when that clock broke but it's been broken longer than it ever ticked",

              "content": "I completely agree, but it's more than just sex. She's devaluing his morals because they don't align with hers.\n I remember being in my 20s and the constant nagging from everyone. \"You need to find a nice guy.\" Why aren't you dating/married?\"I can introduce you to someone.\" Like, I couldn't be single and happy on my own. Then \"when are you getting married?\"You should get pregnant.\"Don't you want kids?\" It's like no no and NO. I'm a woman, and I wanted marriage and kids. But I also wanted freedom and time and to be my own person. Also, all of that is so over rated like come on, we get to live so much longer now. What is the rush? Personally, I purposely told everyone, \"No, I don't want to get married or have kids.\" The faces people made or questioning looks were worth it. If I had been honest, it would have just continued with the nagging. I did get married and have a kid. But I took my time, I made choices, and I had fun. There is nothing wrong with not wanting those things until you are ready or if you never want them. Judging someone because they want something different is bs. Sleeping around or having fun relationships is no one's business but the people involved. It just sounds like OP is just jealous of her BIL's freedom and sex life. She needs to look at herself and question if she really understands her choices. Is she happy with herself, her life, her sex life, and her choices? Does she enjoy her sex life? If so, why can't her BIL? If not, doesn't that mean there's a bigger problem? Does she believe women can enjoy sex? Would she force her daughter into a loveless marriage just because she's a female? Is her daughter sex life or enjoyment of sex going to bother her? Sex is completely natural, and everyone does it. There's no shame in it. So why judge. Also, what if her daughter doesn't want kids? Would she disown her daughter for not wanting them or thinking differently?\nSorry I rambled.",

Is it so impossible for you to fathom that maybe there are women so comfortable with their own sexuality that they, too, are just looking for a fling with your BIL? Not everyone gives a shit about their \u201cticking biological clock\u201d or getting involved a long-term relationship. \n\nI could see wanting to prevent access to your child if your BIL\u2019s choices were rooted in misogyny, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here. In fact, you\u2019re the one being misogynistic by failing to recognize that not all women care about having a family or a relationship, even. Get off your high horse, OP.",
