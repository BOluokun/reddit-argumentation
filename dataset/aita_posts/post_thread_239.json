  "post content": "My husband and I have been together for 4 years. I have two kids (17m /19f). and their half brother is 3 years old.\n\n\n\nthis past week. My husband had an emergency (dad had a medical emergency) and wanted someone to watch our son. he asked my older son and he refused because he was going out with friends. he also asked my daughter but she locked herself in her room to study. I was at the restaurant with my brother meeting his girlfriend for the first time. My husband ended up taking our son with him to the hospital and his mom watched him from there.\n\n\nHe came home and was lashing out on everybody. Calling us selfish and unfeeling. I tried to explain that the kids were busy but he told me to get the f out with that bull because my older son could've skipped the hangout and watched his brother and, my daughter could've watched her brother while studying instead of locking herself in her room. He scolded me as well but I told him I couldn't leave lunch with my brother since he was visiting town and this was my only chance to meet his girlfriend.\n\nHe yelled some more than told us that he was canceling the family holiday trip for christmas this year. The two older kids were upset and said it was unfair. I called him unreasonable to cancel the trip and punish the kids (and possibly me) like that. he refused to discuss it later. Now me and the kids aren't speaking to him and he's saying \"good riddance\"\n\n\n*edit My husband was supposed to watch our son at the time. That's why I went to see my brother at the restaurant. The kids aren't used to watching their brother when neither parent is home.*\n\n\n*update My husband just told us that he'll be spending christmas with his family saying he needs to be around his dad anyway. the kids said they will just go to their dad since they and my husband are still not talking. neither of the kids are happy with how things turned out. so I feel like things have gotten out of hand and the problem got bigger. He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings.*",

So, if I'd called the eldest and told him to keep an eye on his little sister until I got there - he would just help me out. Its his family too, after all. I just never think that older children should always have the responsibility of managing younger siblings like I did. (My problem with it was that I had all of the responsibility and absolutely no authority to impose consequences for unsatisfactory behavior. I got yelled at and harassed and told how incompetent and and lazy I was when my younger siblings refused to do whatever they'd been assigned by our parents to perform. But, even with that disastrous modeling behavior - I still don't think that kids in a family don't have to help out. I just think they are no reasonable substitute for the parents.)",
