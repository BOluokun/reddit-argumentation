  "post content": "This is a throwaway and I'm using fake names.\n\nI am 26F and my \"adopted sister\" Ally is 14F. The way we're \"related\" is that my younger brother Michael (24M) has been with his wife Maya (24F) since their freshman year of high school. Maya and Ally had a really bad home life and my mom is very much a \"my home is open to everyone\" type of person, so over that year Maya began spending more and more time at our house, eventually bringing Ally over as well since she was always babysitting. By the time Michael and Maya were 16 years old, Maya basically lived in the guest room and Ally spent after school, most weekends, holidays, and summer vacation at our house.\n\nMy mom and dad say that they love both Maya and Ally like their own children. My other siblings (18M and 16F) also treat her like she's a part of the family. Even after Maya and Michael moved out, Ally is still at their house the same amount, if not more than she was before. Now to preface, I have nothing against Ally. She's a good kid and I make an effort to be nice to her. However, I've never really liked how she was foisted into our lives. She's not actually adopted and she \\*still has parents and her own family\\*. Yet my parents spend so much time and resources on her, it's ridiculous. Everyone else has started unironically calling her their daughter or sister and I've refused. I just don't consider her to be family.\n\nAnyways, I got married recently, which is where the issues start. I invited Ally to the wedding, of course, and she came with all of my other family. When we were doing pictures of the wedding parties, I decided that I wanted one with all of my immediate family (so my parents, my siblings, and Maya, and Maya and Michael's daughter). My mom brought Ally up to come take the picture with us and I was forced to tell her no. My mom started to get upset but then Ally said it was okay and sat down by herself. My mom isn't a very confrontational person so she didn't make a big deal of it but then everyone else realized that Ally wasn't there and they got mad as well.\n\nUltimately, we took the photo how I wanted it because they \"didn't want to do this at my wedding\" but my entire family is pissed at me now. My mom said that Ally cried when she got home because I don't love her, which I don't. I feel like they forced into a position where I had to do an asshole thing by forcing this kid onto me. I don't think I should have to consider her family if I don't want to. AITA?\n\nEdit: After the ceremony but before the reception, the wedding party and both of our close family's took photos. I did not include Ally in this photo session and she sat with the rest of the regular guests waiting for dinner. I did not intentionally exclude her from any of the photos taken. I'm sure she's in some of them from throughout the night especially because she was there with my family. I hope that clears some things up.\n\nEdit 2: Maya and Ally are sisters. Sorry, forgot to explicitly say that in my post.\n\nFinal edit: \n\nThe people who are agreeing with me are starting to convince me that I'm wrong. To the people calling my parents nasty things in my pms or just saying that they aren't good people: you're dead wrong. My mom is the most caring and kind-hearted woman in the world and I should have made that more clear in my post. \n\nTo be clear, I am also not a monster. I don't mistreat Ally. I get her birthday and Christmas gifts every year. However I am starting to understand that I did do a shitty thing by publicly excluding her at my wedding because I wanted it to be how exactly how I imagined, especially because my mom was apparently blindsided by my feelings.\n\nI was 16-18 when Ally started coming around a lot and I didn't form the same bond everyone else did. I never super liked being around kids, including my sister who by all accounts behaved way worse than Ally ever did. But I recognize that she's become a part of our family. And I think I'm going to make more of an effort to get to know her properly, because I do know she is very mature and intelligent for her age.\n\nAlso, I don't mean to minimize what Maya and Ally have gone through. By saying she wasn't physically abused, I moroso meant to explain why she hadn't been legally removed from her mother's house. She does have extended family that actually cares about her but they live at minimum an hour away so she stays with my parents the majority of the time.\n\nThank you for all of your input.",

Your words sound resentful as if you started being neglected at that time.\n\nBut you're taking it out on Ally like her sister/babysitter removing her from her really bad home life as a preschooler was her fault. Like she had designs on worming her way into your family.\n\nThat's not what happened. I hope you understand that. Perhaps therapy could help.\n\nEDIT FOR CLARITY. YTA Because you were a dick to Ally at your wedding. You could have gotten your immediate family photos in a much nicer fashion.\n\nEDIT 2 (because people keep trying to give me information that I already have):I *know* Ally is not adopted. I *know* she is not OP's family. I *know* that Maya is really Ally's sister. I *know* that OP has every \"right\" to exclude whoever she feels like on her wedding day. I *know* she owes Ally nothing. I *still* think she's an AH for the way she behaved. I'm not sure why everybody wants to change my mind about it.\n\nEDIT 3: Michael and Maya's relationship did not start when they were 16. I question my \"math\" because I'm not sure how old people are when they're freshmen. I was 14/15 so I went with 14.",

Second, it was OPs wedding. This sub loves backing up brides who make decisions for their wedding because it is their day and their decision. OP, the bride, wanted a picture with select people. Her family may view Ally as a sister/daughter but OP doesn't. Maya was in the picture because that is her brothers wife and the mother of OPs niece.\n\nI feel like if worded the right way this posts top comment could easily have been NTA, just so happens the YTA comment got momentum first.\n\nEdit: OP does mention her disagreement on her parents spending time/resources on Ally, I don't view that as resentment, I saw it as disagreeing with their choices.",

I don't believe wedding photographer bill by the picture yet lol\n\nAs someone pointed out, the thing with weddings is that you can do whatever the heck you want but you have to live with the consequences. And OP chose to piss everyone off and make a young girl feel bad to avoid one consensual picture. \n\nThen again I'm leaning towards soft YTA because she doesn't seem to have done anything to make that rejection any smoother - and a 14yo girl's emotions can get big over sometimes like this. It's not really gracious or graceful from how she told.us the story.\n\nChoose your battles I guess?",

I can also see OP just flat out not wanting to do that and I think that is her right given this is her wedding, not Ally's. \n\nOP shared she wasn't excluded from any other photos, seems just these ones and as someone who used to work at weddings, it is very common to have 1 or more photo sessions within the wedding with select people.",

While you could have taken the extra photograph to keep the peace the day of, the fact is, you would have felt weird including someone neither you nor your fiance consider family in a photograph, and likely preferred the photograph without her as is. If that's the one you chose to display at any point, it's just tabling the same fight for another time. She was essentially invited to keep tge peace, as is, not because you wanted to celebrate your wedding with her. You just didn't mind her coming along. It's your wedding day and supposed to be celebrating with family and the people supportive of the couple- which Ally technically is not because you guys have no real relationship. \n\nThere might actually be a slight A H to the parents- if they want you to accept Ally as a sister, what have they actually done to build a relationship between you guys? It kinda seems like they expected you to just have one, and it doesn't work like that with older children. We actually see a lot of that in this sub with step and half siblings- this is really the same scenario. OP just has no personal relationship to Ally, so it makes sense OP would feel weird about a stranger to her being in the wedding photos",

Any child under 18 isn't expected to be forced into a \"step sibling\" relationship, or the parents are assholes, but if you're an adult youre immature and an asshole for the same thing they would excuse if you were just a tad bit younger. \n\nAdults are also allowed to not be forced into \"step/adopted\" relationships just like children are. You cannot force a familial bond that just isn't there and its gross that all these commenters think that you should.",
