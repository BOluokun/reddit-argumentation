I dont know where to start so I'll start abt my parents. they got together after school had finished and had me and my baby brother when they were 18 and 20. My brother and I are 2 years apart. 4 years later, filed a divorce because my bio-dad is an abusive a-hole. took my brother along with him but i have been living with my mom's side ever since i was a baby so that didn't make much of a difference. (Dad lives in another state) I grew up with my grandma up until now, shes also registered as my Foster parent. Not living in the same roof with my mom. My mom married my stepdad back in 2009 and i have 4 stepsiblings. Theyre ok. Often visit me during school holidays.\n\nits been 18 years since the separation. Im 22 now and hes 20. I do think of him every now and then but its just multiple occasion of something important in life like, \"Hope he passed the school yearly test\" etc.. My mom mentioned his name to me a few times like \"Oh he must be 19 this year..\" \"I wonder how he is right now\" and ngl she has been searching for his name on Facebook every now and then. and she told me few years back that a child will always runs back to their mom. \n\nLong story short a few days ago she found him on Facebook. It was obvious because his background picture was my mom when she was young. And she took the initiative to approach him. I dont know how their conversation went but it was enough to know that hes living alone now and has no stable job. My mom asked me if it was okay that shes approaching him, i'd say go for it. thats what she always wanted anyway. \n\nSo last night she asked me if its okay for me to contact him? \"hes really happy he found us\" \"he keep on asking about you. he remembers you\" \"if you dont know what to talk about ask about what hes up to. tell him to go find a stable job\"\n\nAm I the asshole for not getting giddy? I dont even know the guy and i feel like im intruding his life to go and say \"u should look for a stable job\" In all honesty i feel like this is all too sudden, and i have a busy life to keep with. With the pandemic, online classes, my degree, finance and stuff. Throughout my whole life I was ok for not knowing him, I knew he exists somewhere but I dont have the urgency to look for him. And because of my living situation i'm not even a family person. Thanks to my mom I have his contact with me but I really have no ideaa what to say to him. Nor do I want to to keep in contact with him. But i will feel bad if i dont. But i dont want to.\n\nTl;dr found my long lost brother separated for 18 years, mom found him few days ago and I am asked to contact him but i dont feel excited when this all happened. In defense, hes a stranger to me.",

It's a difficult situation and maybe your mother is asking too much for you just to embrace your brother, you know? \nSometimes things take time and it's not like you can flip a switch and become this stranger brother. \nYou say you will feel bad if you don't contact him.... I would too. Maybe just explain him the situation like you are explaining it to us? Very logical and sort of baby steps? Getting to know one another slowly?",

He\u2019s had a rougher life being raised by your father & left alone with nobody to comfort him. Could you having a conversation with him really be the end of the world?
