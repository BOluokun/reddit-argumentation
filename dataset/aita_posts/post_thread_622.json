So my wife and I started bickering because I forgot to buy her favorite kind of ice cream both times I went grocery shopping this month. I told her I'd go out and get some but she started yelling at me. She works a really stressful job so I just figured it was that.\n\nShe didn't want me to go and make a trip to the store just for the ice cream where our local food store is about an hour and a half away (living in a rural place sucks). I insisted, she said no, I said I wouldn't worry about it then. She got mad and said she would go get it and that I could sleep on the couch. I told her \"I'll be godamned, I bought the bed and if you have a problem, you can sleep on the couch\". She countered with the fact that her name is on the lease so it's her roof and I wouldn't be sleeping on the bed under her roof.\n\nby this point it's escalated pretty bad just because of a childish quarrel. But I decided to take it a bit further. While she was gone, I took apart the entire bed and drove it to my friends house.\n\nI'm currently laying in it and I'm about to turn my phone off to avoid the oncoming storm.\n\nAITA?",

Curious if there are deeper issues that are at play here, like the wife is constantly flipping out over little shit and taking her stress out on OP and he never sleeps in the bed and is fed up, or he never does what he says he's going to and the ice cream was the straw that broke the camel's back, or what ever else.\nI'm gonna go with- INFO or ESH if the situation is literally just as he wrote it and they normally get along well.",

Are you going to burn the entire relationship over this? It\u2019s not as if being upset for a week (or to be more accurate, making the active effort to remain upset even when you\u2019d like to move on) is effective either.

So we went through a painful three weeks where I did nothing of his, no laundry(while doing my own), left his dry cleaning while picking up mine, went grocery shopping for food I was interested in and cooked meals for one.  Week one he was fine, but by week two he was annoyed, then week three he had friends over and I had intentionally not cleaned his man cave or the adjoining bathroom and someone commented on all the carry out food and overflowing trash. He finally came to talk to me about chores.  They are split a bit more fairly although I still have about 75% of everything on top of a full time job.
