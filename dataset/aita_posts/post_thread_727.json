  "post content": "I (17f) am a high school senior who just started my last semester. The only credit I need to graduate is a government/econ credit, which I completed at a different high school, but the credits didn\u2019t transfer so here I am staying in hs for an extra semester for a class I\u2019ve already taken. So I can tell after one period with this teacher that she sucks. She puts on videos for us to watch and our assignments are to collect info from the videos. When she lectures she reads from a powerpoint she got off the internet,  clicks through it too fast and doesnt tell us what we should be writing down for our weekly tests. During class I\u2019m thinking to myself, I was forced to stay an extra semester for this lazy teaching and third grade level work? Today she was teaching in her way and assigned us a word search to do after. School is all online so she just posts a picture of the word search, with no instructions on how to edit the picture so that the words could be highlighted. Several students voiced complaints and questions and her responses to all of them were \u201chaha i have no idea\u201d So I take it upon myself to ask a concise question so all of us can have a clear answer: \u201cThis isn\u2019t working for me, what program do you want us to use to be able to edit this picture and do this word search?\u201d And she responds to me \u201cI really don\u2019t care, that\u2019s up to you\u201d just dismissing me and leaving us all to fend for ourselves. A girl unmuted herself to give me some help. And then a couple minutes later the teacher asks \u201cDid that work?\u201d I\u2019m pissed at her at this point and so I mutter to myself \u201cEat my ass, don\u2019t ask me anything\u201d  and look up to see MY MICROPHONE IS UNMUTED SO THE CLASS DEFINITELY HEARD THAT. I closed my laptop after it happened, thought about it and realized that I didn\u2019t feel that bad about it. Am I an asshole?\n\n\nEdit: Guys I didn\u2019t unmute the mike to tell her to eat my ass\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 I muttered it to myself in frustration and the mike happened to be on\n\nAdditionally, this word search was clearly busy work, there was no \u201csearch for definitions and find the thing\u201d it was literally here is a word. look for it in this scramble. does that sound like work 12th graders should be doing? and all of the work shes given us are pictures of what we\u2019d normally be doing in class, word searches, coloring all that kind of bs; the pandemic hasn\u2019t hurt her teaching style. I see though that my anger was justified but my disrespect wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t meant for her to hear so the my move going forward is to apologize,explain my frustration and hope for the best lol",

But I will also say that the lecture style at least sounds a lot like how many college professors teach class, so you're probably going to have to focus on other problems than just \u201cshe shows us videos and slides and expects us to take notes and figure out what's important for ourselves\". Like \u201cshe goes through the slides too quickly, it's really hard to keep up\", or the other busywork she gives and particularly the word search thing and how no one could figure out what they were doing.\n\nEdits: to clarify things after OP posted clarification of their own",

This sounds like a shitty teacher; of course there are also terrible college profs, but this is not what a good government class looks like. The only absurd suggestion here is that the teacher tell them what notes to take. But teachers who read quickly off slides are mocked by those of us who actually want to teach students things.\n\nIf OP talked like that in my class even under his breath I\u2019d boot him immediately. That\u2019s a horrifying way to speak aloud during a class, and I\u2019d either need a real apology or some sort of mediated disciplinary conversation. OP also obviously has no leg to stand on wanting to be told what notes to take, and needs a real attitude adjustment on that before college.\n\n(Source: am college government professor)",
