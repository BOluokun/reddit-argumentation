It might be hard, but you really should talk to her.\nShe genuinely cares and wants to help, and it\u2019ll be painfully draining on her until you communicate. I didn\u2019t want to tell my parents why I spent every day in my room with blankets hung over the windows, but life got so much better when I did.",

Has to be the right person though, and your mom doesn\u2019t sound right to be the first person you talk to. Maybe try and find a counselor at school, get some stuff off your chest and some advice.

You\u2019re being homeschooled, and that can be isolating, especially given how easily it is (for me at least) to isolate yourself when depressed, and you don\u2019t have the resources of a guidance counselor who at least a little bit of training on how to handle this. You aren\u2019t the asshole for being depressed & not being ready to talk about it, but while your mom isn\u2019t handling this in the best way, she\u2019s not wrong that you need resources beyond what she can provide.",
