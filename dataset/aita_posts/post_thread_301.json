  "post content": "\n\nMy M30 brother in law M20 \"Sean\" moved in with me and his sister after my father in law passed away few months ago.\n\nHe is the private type and keeps to himself. He goes out and never say where he's going or how long he'll be out, eats at random times during the day, wears earpuds while me and the kids are sitting with him. See, all of these are uncool behaviors and a bad influence on my children. I've already talked to Sean about certain house rules I have and how he was violating them maybe because he didn't but now he knows and still nothing's changed.\n\n\nLast night, he came home late at around 10pm. I wasn't thrilled with that because he knew the rules but he said that he was an adult and I shouldn't be policing him but it's not about that, it's about the fact that he's repeatedly disrespected the homeowner and the rules...So I told him this: \"If he won't respect the rules which are: Being home at 8, not eating at random times, and not using his electronics just like my kids aren't allowed when the family is gathered to spend time together. He ranted about how he wasn't a child, my child and called me unreasonable to treat him this way just because he lives under my roof, I told him it's not hard to show respect really but my wife went off asking what was wrong with me to be giving Sean who's still grieving, ultimatums and treating him like a child. I explained to her that I'm just making sure the kids won't be influenced by her brother's reckless behavior and she laughed asking if I think Sean being on his phone was reckless but that is besides the point. She called me a control freak and told me to get off her brother's back and leave him alone. I replied that she's just saying this because he's her brother but she said I overstepped and should back off and stop trying to control her adult brother. I asked her if she was happy with him coming home late and she said she was sick of arguing then went upstairs.\n\n\nAITA here?",

You are setting a terrible example for your children when it comes to empathy. This is a real teachable moment for an impressionable mind about how to deal with someone who is hurting and how to actually help them. And quite frankly you\u2019re fucking blowing it big time.

Be home at a reasonable time OR don't make a ruckus coming in (ie don't wake up the household if you are staying out past 10 or 11 PM and you come home)\n2. Clean up after you eat, including washing dishes or putting them in the sink for sister if she is okay, OR eat with the family. (IE, don't create a ton of extra work for the sister to clean up after the brother)\n3. If we are in a family setting where talking is expected, please don't use earbuds. \n4. basically be respectful that you are living in a house with other people, including children, so don't create a huge mess/noise.",
