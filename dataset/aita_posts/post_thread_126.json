  "post content": "UPDATE: First of all, thank you all for the comments and the valuable insights. I tried to respond to everyone's questions and advice but it became impossible, what with hundreds of comments flooding in which is not something I expected so yes, thank you!\n\nI'm not sure this is how you do an update so I hope everyone who was interested in the update will be able to see this!\n\nFirst, let me address one thing that I now realize I'd left unclear in my OG post: The fiance did not REFUSE to say where he spent the money. I was the one that clammed him up by impulsively saying I didn't care (I was so upset I couldn't even be in the same room, let alone listen to what he had to say and that's on me).\n\nSecondly, a lot of you suggested he may be gambling or cheating - he is doing neither, thank goodness LOL I can vouch for that.\n\nNow, update!! I got up this morning and woke him up saying I wanted to re-address the money thing. He immediately got up and we started to talk. I told him that I wanted my share back as soon as possible, within this week preferably. I didn't care how he would get the money back and I told him he was free to sell the comics if he needed to. Now, onto the COMICS. He didn't lie about the price. He showed me the receipt and yes, it did cost as much as he had told me it cost. I just wanted to clear that up too now that I also have proof.\n\nAnyway, I asked him about where the money went and here is what he said, (and provided texts for me to see): He started off with an apology and said he'd give me the money back. He re-stated the gift thing. He ordered it in back in February and, as per the shop site, didn't expect it before the end of March (it may sound strange to people from normal countries, but I've waited for my packages for up to 2 months sometimes). He expected he'd get his salary right on time to pay for the comic but this didn't happen as his pay ran two days late (which it was, I remember) and the package arrived on time, so he (in his own words) carelessly took the money with the intention of returning it. I asked why he didn't return it, he apologized and said he wanted to but that wasn't enough for me. The rest of the money went to pay a bill from the apartment he rented prior to us moving together. Long story short, THAT SAME BUDDY I MENTIONED had moved into that apartment when my fiance moved out (and he and I moved in) and the buddy stayed for like a month and left without paying that month's utilities. Instead of calling the police, the owner of that previous flat called my fiance. Since he knew his buddy couldn't pay for the damn bill, he ended up paying it so she didn't call the police on the buddy. I saw the text message exchange. When asked why he didn't tell me, he said he knew I'd be very upset but that he felt it was the right thing to do (to pay for the bill) and that he now realizes just how stupid he was. Kept on apologizing and for calling me an ass for being mad.\n\nI told him my trust is very hard to be earned back and that, should we stay together, I will not be interested in mutual savings or anything similar to that. I gave him a two week deadline to give me my money back and he said he'd give it back sooner than that. I told him I will save on my own and that he's free to do what he wants with his money. He asked me if I could reconsider and start a travel fund again (this time, using a proper bank account, etc.) but I refused and will not entertain the idea.\n\nWe have decided to stay together but I am super cautious about going forward. I have suggested couple counseling so we can figure out why in the WORLD he does such mindless things without asking me or even trusting me and he has agreed to the idea, so we will see. There's a lot to (re)build but at least now I know what actually transpired. Still mad at him but yes. Thank you!!\n\nEDIT: Wow I...didn't expect this kind of response and I'm not sure how edits work here and if any one of you who have given me advice will see the edit. Thank you, first of all, for helping me go forward. I will have another serious discussion with Jack and see where the rest of the money went because its not like he flatly rejected telling me, its that i was so mad I just told him I didn't care about any of his excuses so...Hopefully I shall resolve this mystery soon. I will update properly tomorrow so if anyone wants to read more about my drama, feel free to check back tomorrow at this time haha \ud83d\ude05\n\nHello! Long time lurker/commenter in need of judgement.\n\nA few months ago my fiance whom I will call Jack and I decided to start a small travel fund. I told Jack that, when I was in my 20s, I used to save money for trips and that I never used my travel fund for anything else (like being tempted to grab some cash from it when I really needed it). It helped me save plenty without burning a hole in my pocket once I was on the road and he liked the idea. I made it explicitly clear that this was super important to me because we don't have super high earnings and anything we can save for the fund would be lovely since we were planning to travel to Italy this year.\n\nFor 3-4 months we both contributed to the fund and we saved up enough to cover accommodation expenses which made me excited.\n\nA few days ago, I was cleaning up and something made me look into our fund. Now, the fund is an envelope (I know, I know) and I opened it just to remind myself how much we saved, only to see the fund was empty. The money was gone.\n\nWhen Jack came back from the store, I asked him where the money was and he said he spent a half of it on a gift he recently bought me (it was a hardcover comic book I knew was pricey and was very happy and grateful when I received it). Jack wouldn't say where the other half was. I was livid. Not because he spent the money (though that also upsets me) but because he spent it without telling me.\n\nHis excuse is he didn't take me seriously when I said this was important to me. Jack said he would put the money back and that he was sorry and that he didn't think it was going to be such a big deal. I told him I didn't trust him anymore and that the fact he used the money I contributed to either buy my own gift or to spend it on god knows what was a severe violation of trust from my pov.\n\nJack said I was being an asshole about it and we're still just as upset at each other.\n\nWas I really TA? I'm sorry if this text is confusing, I'll answer questions or make edits if something is unclear. :(",

You are \u2018in a relationship\u2019 with him so everything that was yours is all his now, right?  You are no longer a person - you know, like his buddy.  He wouldn\u2019t go over and steal all of his buddy\u2019s cash, would he?  Because he is a guy.  \n\nIt\u2019s up to you to find your backbone - or to accept his limp, pathetic excuses.  \u201cI didn\u2019t think stealing from you was that big a deal.\u201d  \u201cOh, I used part of the stolen money on a gift for *you* (that you didn\u2019t ask for) so it\u2019s okay, right?\u201d  \u201cYou are being an ahole about this so it\u2019s all your fault we are upset with each other\u201d.   \n\nI\u2019d rather live alone than be a mark to be taken advantage of and stolen from.

Are women permitted to have their separate money and bank accounts?  \n\nAnd if you don\u2019t know him well enough to have a really good guess on where the money he stole went, then you don\u2019t know this guy at all; you\u2019ve never paid attention or he\u2019s just good at secrets.  I\u2019m doubting the \u2018buddy\u2019 is the recipient of all of his largesse.  Maybe some, but he makes a convenient cover story for some expenditures.\n\nAlso, reality called.  You are never \u2018going to Italy\u2019 with this guy unless you pay.  For the sake of all things worthy, secure your money and valuables before everything you have is gone.  Quadruple your birth control while you are at it and get an STD check up.\n\nNTA, but I\u2019m side-eyeing some of your actions.  Not demanding the money back?  Continuing to \u2018discuss\u2019 the ~~situation~~ THEFT ad nauseum?  Thinking that his \u2018buddy\u2019 is the only thing he is spending extra money on?   \n\nYou are lucky.  This is a canary-in-the-coal-mines scenario.  The amount of money you lost wasn\u2019t huge; it could have been much worse.  The lesson is that you and this dude-bro are fundamentally incompatible.  He doesn\u2019t want to abide by financial rules or save to go to Europe or respect your property as separate.  He doesn\u2019t want anyone to tell him what to do with his money or to have to explain what he spends money on.  He wants someone at home to do all of the domestic stuff, plus generate income, while he and his buddies do the real things he likes.  But now the blinders should be off.",

The question is, *why* is he taking money from there. Convenience? A card is just as easy to use in 90% of places these days and transferring people money is easy. \n\nSo why did he really go into your fund, and not take out his own money? He is playing stupid, but he knew you would find out and it would cause a fight. Even if he has no respect, most people wouldn't consider that worth the agro ... Unless he didn't have that kind of money to spend himself. \n\nOP if you choose to  stay, you cannot marry this man without a full understanding of his financial situation. This is perfectly sensible for people looking to marry and he should have no issue with the two of you being open about savings, shares, assets  and IMPORTANTLY debt, credit cards and loans. Especially when he has just majorly broken your trust specifically around shared savings. \n\nIf he goes nuts and tries gaslighting you about wanting to see his financial situation then there is something going on he does not want you to see.
