  "post content": "Sorry for formatting, am on mobile.\n\n\nI (16M) am diagnosed autistic and have been for around ten years now. I\u2019m currently living with my mom, stepdad, and two sisters who are 12 and 7.  The 7 year old is the only one referenced in this post, so we\u2019ll call her M.\n\nSo because I am autistic, I get overwhelmed fairly easily and often have to do some form of stimming, such as flicking my hands or playing with a small toy, to calm down. Recently I found a weird squishy thing laying around the house that I really enjoy using. It\u2019s one of those balls with holes in it and a sac of little colored balls that come out of the holes. I can\u2019t paste a link here because of character limits, but just Google \u201corbeez mesh ball\u201d. The thing is, it\u2019s painted to look like some sort of green spider, and it\u2019s got a fairly realistic spider body hanging off of it.\n\nNow this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, but it is as we\u2019re pretty sure M has a few issues of her own (she was in the process of being tested for autism as well but we have to wait due to COVID). Relating to that, she\u2019s got a lot of anxiety about certain things. Mostly bugs.\n\n... I\u2019m sure you can see where this is going, right? Today, I had the spider thing laying on the couch next to me while I was doing schoolwork, which at times will leave me a bit overwhelmed if I get stuck, so I had it there for easy stim breaks. M came in, sat on the floor, and started watching TV. She didn\u2019t notice the toy up until I started squeezing it. \n\nIt makes a little noise when you squeeze it, so she heard it, looked over, saw only the spider body hanging out of my hand, and began crying and screaming for our mom (she\u2019s usually the only one able to calm her during the meltdowns). Our mom came running in to comfort her and I got up with my stuff and left the room, because loud noises and shouting also overwhelm me and it was getting pretty loud in there.\n\nFast forward a few hours, my mom comes in my room and she\u2019s clearly upset. I asked her what was wrong and she exploded about how I \u201cpurposely triggered my sister with a disgusting fake bug\u201d. I didn\u2019t even understand that she was talking about the spider toy until she grabbed it from my table and insisted that I give it up to her.\n\nI basically told her, that\u2019s mine and it helps me calm down. I forgot about M\u2019s anxiety. I love my sister, I would have never done something on purpose to upset her. I won\u2019t use it in the room with M again but no, you can\u2019t take it from me. She yelled at me a bit for being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d, but eventually left it when she saw I wasn\u2019t going to give up my toy. \n\nIt\u2019s been another hour since, and her and my stepdad (who I assume was told the story by her) have both called me an asshole. My other sister (who heard it from me) said she doesn\u2019t think I was an asshole per se, but I still should have just given it up.\n\nSo, was I an asshole?",

You mentioned leaving the room when she started yelling, because it's triggering for you. Now pretend your sister now uses yelling every time as a way to calm herself, even though it's upsetting to you. It would be difficult for you to be around her not knowing if she would yell. That's how she feels: it's uncomfortable for your sister not knowing if she is going to come across that bug ball thing. \n\nI would talk to your sister and apologize for unintentionally upsetting her, and explain it is something that helps you feel better. Ask her if you promise to keep it in your room, if she can handle that. Even better, go get one without a bug on it! \n\nI don't want to assume you have difficulties with empathy, but this is a perfect situation where empathy is valuable; being able to put yourself in your sister shoes can help you see that keeping your ball might be more trouble then it is soothing.",

I\u2019m sure you can see where this is going, right? \n\nYes, and so should your mom have done, whether she's neurotypical or not. \n\nEveryone makes a thoughtless mistake every now and then that fails to take into account someone else's feelings. Having autism makes you more likely to make these mistakes, which the people you live with should also know. It's not like you were waving the toy at her, your purpose was innocent. So too was your poor sister's reaction. \n\nYou overplayed your hand in telling your mother what she couldn't do in her own house: She most certainly can take whatever she wants from you. I imagine she gave you the benefit of the doubt, and took you instead to mean \"It would be a really bad idea to take this from me over this\", which I think it would've been. \n\nIt would have been more appropriate for others to give you the opportunity to apologize for accidentally hurting her feelings, instead of skipping straight to denouncing you. If this hurt your feelings, it would be good to tell them that. \n\nConsider apologizing to your mother for backtalking her. Definitely apologize to your sister for frightening her with the toy. The holiday season is coming, maybe you can buy her one to give to you as a two-way peace offering... one that doesn't look like a giant horrible arachnid :)",
