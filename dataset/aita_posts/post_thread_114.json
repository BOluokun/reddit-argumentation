  "post content": "My boyfriend(32m) and I(35f) have been together for 1 year. I haven't got any kids. He has got a 4-year-old son who lives with his mom(my bf's ex). My boyfriend fetches his son every weekend. He has recently introduced me to his son. We get along really well. He's sweet & very talkative. \nI have helped raise my nieces & nephews, so I think that I  am good with kids. I don't believe in hitting kids. We talk things through. This has been my approach with my bf's son, too.\n\nHe is always up to something, taking things apart or pressing buttons, but that's because he's curious. I always speak to him calmly & have started explaining things to him. So now, he asks me questions like, \"What does this do?\" \"What is this?\", and we explore things together (less things being broken). \n\n I recently received a call from the mother of my boyfriend son, a\u2078sking me to stop using all these \"new age phrases\" on her child. She said that my \"funny things\" are interfering with her parenting style. Apparently, the boy said, \"Don't shout, Mommy. Speak soft like Auntie.\" He also said,\"ok. take a deep breath, mommy, \" whenever she would raise her voice at him. At first, I told her that I wasn't trying to interfere with her parenting style, but that that is how I deal with children. She told me to \"go make my own kids and then teach them shit.\" That hurt me, and I told her that maybe her parenting style needs an update. \n\nNow, she refuses to let the child be around me. She is starting to refuse my bf access to his son because of my interference. My friend thinks that I shouldn't have told her that her parenting needs an update & let my bf handle this instead. I feel terrible. Am I the ass hole?\n\nEdit: \nJust an update. My bf & I are moving in together, so we had to resolve this. The three of us had dinner together and talked things through. I apologised for telling her to upgrade her parenting style, and she apologised for what she said. All of us want what is best for the child, so we've decided that should any issues arise, she is to talk directly to my bf & not me. \nMy bf has also consulted with a family lawyer & they  are in the process of drawing up a custody agreement.",

We women can be so terrible to one another when it comes to parenting. Everything is a problem and no-one is respectable when it comes to watching other people parent. It's a sad state in society that I would urge you not to participate in.\n\nBut the reality is that she's a bit unhinged and this custody thing is going to be a problem.\n\nEvery divorce has a custory arrangement. If she denies Dad his time with the child, he needs to bring her to court. She'll likely bend when she realizes that it's being brought to court, but if she doesn't, the likely result will be that he ends up with full custody. Courts take child estrangement and not following the divorce agreement very seriously.  \n\n\nEdit. I changed my mind, looking at the options, and went from YTA to ESH. That's a better fit.

It's really easy to criticize someone else's parenting when the only \"parenting\" you've ever had to do is caring for a child minimally part-time with the full support of a loving partner. It's easy to be endlessly patient when you're not the one single parenting 24 hours a day with no backup, feeling exhausted, touched out, and there is no break nor another parent to pick up the slack if you aren't feeling well, are overtired, etc. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with OP's parenting methods, but her deeply self-righteous attitude grates. It's easy to say, \"You should never yell at your child.\" It's also easy to be the perfect parent when you've never had to parent around the clock, by yourself . . . and have it made WORSE by a co-parent's new partner shaming you for being human and fallible. \n\nAnd I say this as someone who was a lot like OP. I don't have kids of my own, but I've worked with young kids for over 30 years, and helped raise my niblings as well. And I used to be just as self-righteous about parents I thought were \"harsh\" and \"not patient enough\" . . . until I grew up a little and REALLY STARTED WATCHING AND LISTENING to my sister, the actual parent. And she was really smart when she gently pointed out to me that as wonderful as I was with her kids, and as much as she appreciated all that I did (including bedtimes, school runs, sick days . . . all the tough stuff), I didn't have to do it 24/7/365. I didn't have to take care of the sick kids when I was also really sick and trying not to vomit; I didn't have to do the school run if I was too exhausted. This other mother may not always be \"gentle parenting\" and she may lose her temper sometimes . . . but she's doing everything herself, and doing the best she can.\n\nOP is a massive, self-important AH, and if she thinks she's a better parent who has any right to say anything because she \"helped raise\" someone else's kids, she needs to pay closer attention.",
