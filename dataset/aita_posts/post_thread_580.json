Anyways, last week she did something that kind of hurt me, and Ik looking for advice on how to go forward with this.\n\n2 weeks ago she told me she was sick and couldn't make it, but this isn't the part that upset me: people get sick all the time and need to stay home from work, so that was no big deal. I was a little bummed, but it was no bug deal. So last week I showed up to the office and waited for a while before someone asked me who I was there to see, and a few minutes after I told them another person came out and told me my therapist was out for the week.

Rejection sensitivity makes me feel nauseous, dizzy, it makes me feel like there's a hot iron on rhe back of my head, and like there's a hole in my chest. Rejection sensitivity makes things as normal and small as this hurt.\n\nI know I'm really sensitive to this kind of thing, but I don't know if I'm being overly sensitive.

I'm afraid if I bring it up I'll be an asshole if it makes her feel guilty or like she's bad at her job, because she's not; she has nothing to be guilty over and she's great at her job. But on the other hand, I feel like I need to get this off my chest and it's her job to help me work through this kind of thing. I also feel like it would overall be the right move to just talk about this and clear the air.\n\nI know that she's not an AH here, but I'm wondering how I should go about this or if I should bring it up with her at all.\n\nTL:DR\nMy therapist didn't let me know she was going to miss a session, and I'm not sure if/how I should bring up that it made me feel shitty.",

Trust is the single most important thing you need from your therapist - how are you supposed to open up to them if they don't feel like they are a consistently safe presence in your life? I have left therapists for similar reasons, because I need to have safety in that relationship.",

I am sure it was just a mistake and they are only human but it gives them a chance to acknowledge their mistake and how you feel about it. \n\nIf they are a good therapist they wont be offended by this, trust me, they tend to have thick skin and should not take this to heart.\n\nAlso congrats for working through therapy!",
