  "post content": "I(22F) was taking a 10hour bus. The seats were tiny and considering I am pretty skinny I was fitting normally. However, my seat mate was a severely overweight lady around her 30y. \n\nI didn\u2019t wanna be mean so I shoved myself in the window and even then our sides were joined and I was feeling like she was leaning on me. I was by the window and her by the isle. I glanced back and saw a grandma sitting by herself and smiled at her and asked if she minds if I join her.\n\nShe smiled and nodded and the lady next to me frowned and said. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d I told her honestly I was cramping and had no space to even shift around.\n\nThis woman got so upset after that and started saying I was fat-phobic, skinny hoe, a-hole.. I told her honestly I cannot last 10hours like this and I am not staying in the seat to save her feelings and she can think whatever she wants.\n\nShe then proceeded to make an hour long phone call calling me white trash and what not. My mom said I should have waited for a rest stop and just sat down behind the lady as opposed to saying she has left me no space. Idk, I don\u2019t think I was mean. AITA?\n\nEdit: for everyone saying this story is fake, there is a lovely person down in the comments that said they wish I will get health related issues, gain weight and get my ultimate punishment. All kinds of people out there",
