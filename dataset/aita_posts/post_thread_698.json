  "post content": "Some background - I have a small 12 lb dog that barks a lot at other  living creatures. He's super friendly and not at all aggressive, but he  likes to say hello with a passion, which can sometimes startle people  and his barking gets very annoying when he\u2019s out in the yard chasing  birds and squirrels.\n\nThe other night I was coming back from his nighttime walk at about  10:30pm. Neighbor a few houses away who I\u2019ve never met is out with his  dog, who is much bigger than mine maybe \\~40 lbs. The dogs will bark at  each other, my neighbor isn\u2019t friendly, and so when we encounter each  other we typically just walk past each other as quickly as possible  pulling our respective dogs along as they both bark away. On this night  its dark and his dog is peeing on a tree, and they don't see us. I pull  my dog in close to me and work on keeping him calm, but as we get closer  he starts barking like a mad dog. My neighbor's dog gets startled, and  immediately charges at us. Neighbor has a retractable leash, and the dog  reaches the end of it and snaps around 180 degrees. He doubles back  towards us and this time the neighbor loses the leash. The dog attacks  mine and throws him up in the air. I shove the neighbor's dog aside and  pick mine up. Neighbor grabs his dog and everyone calms down. He  apologizes and swears his dog has never done anything like this. My dog  seems shaken but ok, so we go our separate ways with him saying to let  him know if we need anything.\n\nOnce I get in my house I see my dog is bleeding, shaking like crazy,  and wont' put any weight on one hind leg. So I decide better take him  into the doggy ER (at near midnight on a work night). Luckily there was  nobody else there and other than some cuts and bruising, my dog is ok.  They provide some pain meds and send us on our way with a bill of $280.\n\nThe next day I walk over to my neighbors with the bill and other ER  paperwork. He is surprised as he thought my dog was ok, and offers to  split it with me. I suggest as he is the one that lost control of his  dog, that he should pay the entire bill. I also mention that the ER  suggested I file a police report to get an official record of the  incident in case it ever happens again, which I did not do. The neighbor  flips out at me, saying my dog instigated the attack, and he lost the  leash because he\u2019s recovering from back surgery. He says he is trying to  be nice by offering to split the bill with me, and that my response to  his neighborliness was to threaten to call the police. He further adds  that he is our rep for the HOA and that my dog is a nuisance with all of  his barking, and he could file a quality of life complaint (we don\u2019t  let my dog out at all at night/early morning, so he\u2019s never making noise  when noise ordinance is in effect). In the end after some back and  forth, he begrudgingly paid for the ER bill.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for asking my neighbor to pay the pet ER bill after my annoying dog instigated his to attack?\n\n\\*EDIT: I have no idea how to interpret the results here.  The majority of comments saying I'm NTA, but these comments are all being downvoted while the minority saying either ESH or YTA are being upvoted, and my total Karma from the post is -92.  I see the post has been tagged as Everyone Sucks so I think that means I should probably just leave things alone with the neighbor and hope that this is the end of it.",

So I posted here hoping someone would explain to me why despite being in the \"right\" I still felt like an asshole.  You've helped me recognize, I could have prevented the entire situation by just being more aware of my surroundings and either turning around or giving him a heads up I was near.  Still don't think that excuses him losing control of his dog, if he has a bad back he probably shouldn't be using a retractable leash, but I failed to recognize my surroundings and the approaching situation despite knowing my dog's tendencies.

On the advice of our trainer, who were were seeing weekly we tried using a choke collar, but that didn't help much and caused my dog to throw up.  Vet said to never use a choke collar on such a small dog.  So we stopped going to that trainer.  Tried a shock collar, that helps when he's around the house, but he ignores it completely when we're out on walks and he sees another dog, even at a high setting.  We've had some luck using a spray bottle coupled with treats (negative feedback for negative behavior, positive for positive). I think I am going to try one of the group classes at the local Petco next. The crazy thing is when we bring him to the dog park and take him off the leash, he shuts right up, ignores the other dogs, and just walks around sniffing their pee.",

Group classes could help desensitize things, but you might want to try and find a in home behaviorist. Because while training does help, somethings you need to get to the root of the problem which could be behavioral. I wish you luck! And you should be proud of yourself you are trying to do right by your dog, some people would have given their dog up for even less.",
