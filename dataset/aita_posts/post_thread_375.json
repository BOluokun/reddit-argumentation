  "post content": "So I (35M) was in a motorcycle accident earlier this week. My wife (35F) has 3 kids from a previous marriage (17F, 10M, 5M) and we have a 1 year old together. I had a collapsed lung and had a chest tube put in, a broken leg and arm and torn ligaments in my knee. I've been in the hospital since Monday. She came out the day of my accident and stayed until about 4 am. Was back that same morning but has gone home each night. Yesterday she only stayed until about 1 pm to prepare the house for the hurricane and didn't come at all today because the weather wasn't great and she said she didn't want to leave the kids. \n\nI told her I was upset that I basically went through everything alone. That I would've done anything to be with her. She told me she's been there as much as possible and it's not fair to dump all the kids on her daughter especially since I'll need a lot of help when I get home and her daughter will need to help with the kids when she works. I told her marriage means through thick and thin and I feel abandoned. Now I'm getting one word answers from her. AITA for feeling like an afterthought?",
