  "post content": "I'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. I've lived there for 6 years. My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.\n\nSo I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great.\n\nThis is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food.\n\nI asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.\n\nOverall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.\n\nEDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",

So many people on this sub are just struggling for self-awareness, wading through uncharted territory, or trying to figure out how to navigate a complex situation with many moving parts and lasting social repercussions. Sometimes it's hard to know what to say, how to reach them, and especially how to reduce the situation down to a single three-letter acronym. But you, OP, are a 100% bonafide asshole. Let's count the ways.\n\n1. You're clearly making her extremely uncomfortable. You've caused her to feel like she has to walk on eggshells when leaving and entering her own home, because a strange man down the hall keeps insisting that she... cook for him? What the fuck? Hell, she might even feel like you're monitoring her movement in and out of the apartment in order to ambush her about cooking for you, which will **obviously creep her the fuck out** and **make her feel uncomfortable in her own home**.\n2. Why **on earth** would you think that you're entitled to this person's cooking? Even if she were your spouse this would be a problem, and you don't even know her! How did you hear her say 'no' and decide to keep pressing the issue? She's calling you a stranger because *you are a stranger*, and she's telling you no because *NO*.\n3. \"I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man.\" Damn, dude. Fuck off with that nonsense.\n\nYou ***are*** a jerk, you ***were*** being creepy, and you should be **way more embarrassed than you are**.\n\nStop harassing your neighbor, learn to cook, and **leave her the fuck alone**.\n\nChrist, OP. She said no.",

Creepy men always love pointing that out when they get called out for their shit as if to say \"don't worry sweetheart, you're not good enough for me to be creepy towards and if you were then you should be flattered.\" STFU dude, you're a fucking creep!\n\nGuy did this to me once. At a party, went to sleep in a room right next to my then-boyfriend on the ground. Didn't know everyone at the party but knew the hosts well. Woke up in the middle of the night to a man masturbating on the bed to my left. It was pitch black and no one had been in the bed when we went to sleep so I had no clue who it was. Couldn't get my boyfriend to wake up and when he finally does he leaves to go to the bathroom and the man quickly lays down so he goes unnoticed. Fuck no! I get up and follow my bf to the bathroom to tell him what's going on. He comes back and turns the light on to find it was one of our friends boyfriends.\n\nThe next day I remember him pointing out that he wasn't even attracted to me so therefore what he did wasn't wrong and I just wanted attention. My then boyfriend started to doubt the whole thing. Now I do think that the guy was just drunk and not thinking.... But how about just acknowledging how freaky it would be to wake up and see someone masturbating next to you? Say you were drunk, and sorry that it happened, you didn't mean to scare me. But no, instead it's made into I'm not attractive enough to assault and I should let it go.\n\nEDIT: grammar",

I nudge him off again even though it was actually pretty comfortable because I am awake and letting it go would have been odd. \n\nWhen he woke up in the morning and I told him he was HORRIFIED. He could not stop apologizing. He apparently is a cuddler from childhood on up but normally didn't sleep that close to people he want in a relationship with. He apologized and made no excuses other than \"I'm such a weirdo, I'm so sorry. I promise I was asleep. I know I cuddled my ex girlfriends when I slept but it never crossed my mind that it would be automatic. I'm so incredibly sorry, can I buy you a coffee? Please don't hate me.\" \n\nI am telling you this to point out that this very invent mistake was taken more seriously than this creep masterbating next to you. This is how I would've expected someone to react if they messed up. Everyone else found this funny, myself included but he did not because it was his reputation and his actions. \n\nI offered to provide an objective written reference if his A+ cuddling skills and we let if go bye.

The worst part was that of all the people that called in with their opinions, more than half of them were on the husband's side!! Even women were calling in and agreeing that it just wouldn't be the same if the husband cooked. WTF. Watch some youtube videos and figure it out, dude. Thankfully the hosts sided with the wife and in the end they agreed that he would cook a few dishes and order the rest from a caterer but if the wife stepped one foot into the kitchen he had failed her as a man.

You talk as though your only options are either takeout or Katie and they're not.\n\nYou assumed it wasn't the other person cooking because he's a single old man? Single old men eat too, there's no reason he couldn't be cooking? What a weird assumption.\n\nWhen she said she was busy, that was a polite way of saying no. It doesn't matter that she's cooking for herself every day, the socially appropriate thing to do would be to gracefully back off with the offer. Instead, you doubled down. You weren't asking her to split cooking though, you were asking her to do 100% of the cooking, including planning and buying ingredients. It's one thing to do this when it's your job, because you are paid for your time and so on. You keep saying it's not a big deal cos she's cooking anyway, but I think you're overlooking things. What if she doesn't want to cook one night? What if she stays late at work? What if she's sick? Speaking for myself I wouldn't want that sense of being responsible in some way for your meals, particularly when I don't know you well.\n\nAlso you can be creepy even if you're not into someone, you know. Being creepy is about not respecting boundaries, which is exactly what you did when you pushed the issue after she'd already declined. Making sure you told us that she isn't your type makes you sound like an asshole.",

Luckily I can get healthy take away food where I live.\n\nI'm not friends with anyone in my apartment building but I know them and we are on good terms. I have a really good relationship with one couple especially and we've known each other for 10 years. The woman is especially nice and she's helped me with all kinds of stuff before. Like sewing a whole in my jeans and stuff like that.\n\nThe thought of me asking her to cook for me everyday is so cringe worthy I can't even describe it.\n\nEdit: Since this post has been locked I'll answer the reply from /u/Welcoming32 here.\n\n> Without commenting one way or the other, could you possibly express yourself in a manner that would be more hurtful?\n\nYes I could easily be more hurtful. I didn't say anything negative about OP at all. Only about the actions he took.\n\n> Are you trying to send someone into a shame spiral?\n\nNo. I was giving my opinion about how I'd feel if I had done what OP did. I'm not sure exactly what made you think I was trying to do that. Is it \"cringe worthy\" that did it?\n\n> Are you one of the people that acts shocked when people break and do harmful things to society, despite contributing to the problem with your hurtful vitriol?\n\nNo I'm not shocked when that happens. It's also not my responsibility to stop that from happening. I don't want to be rude to other people but other than that I'll speak my mind. If that somehow affects society negatively then so be it. \n\nIf you think I was rude in my original post I'd like to know what specifically was rude.\n\n>  The fact that you can\u2019t muster up some constructive advice despite being in your 30\u2019s is likely why you are single and angry. Get some help big guy.\n\nI did muster up some constructive criticism/advice.\n\n1. Get healthy takeaway food.\n2. Don't do something as cringe worthy as asking a stranger to cook for you.\n\nWhy do you think I'm mad? I was reading through the comments of a post and since I'm in a pretty similar situation to OP I thought my perspective on the matter was relevant.. I honestly don't see how you get mad from my comment at all. Please enlighten me.\n\n\n**Edit2:**\n> Making OP feel estranged and humiliated was clearly your goal. Words matter. If he was your brother, you\u2019d choose your words more carefully. Instead, he\u2019s an internet stranger, so hey, who gives a shit, make him feel like scum garbage.\n\nSo I asked you to enlighten me on exactly what word(s) you found to be rude specifically. You can't do either but can only call me a dick and throw out a generic \"words matter\". Sure they do, tell me which ones exactly got your panties this much in a bunch?\n\n> Just another keyboard tough guy.\n\nI'm the keyboard tough guy? I haven't resorted to name calling or anything of the sorts.\n\n> Hope things get better for you, bud.\n\nYou're not my bud, pal!\n\nAlso do you have some sort of prejudice that single guys are not happy?

Does she use hers and do you factor in that cost).\n\nThink about it, you two would have to be in constant communication now re. meals, if you expect food every time she cooks and assume that is every evening then she now has to let you know every time she doesn't, so every time she goes on holiday, or is out for the evening, or is having friends round and they are getting pizza etc etc. She also now needs to take into account your tastes and any dietry needs, if you don't like what she cooks will you still pay her?

Do you still pay her for what she makes or is she now out the cost of that food? \n\nThat is all actually a lot of planning, organisation and constant communication ie. work and emotional labour.",
