I worked but I didn't make anywhere near enough to be on my own. \n\nRecently, that changed. I pushed myself, stayed focused and managed to get a really good remote job that pays well.\n\nI want to get out of here. I would leave right this second. The thing is that part of the culture I come from is that family is #1 priority. My family would be saddened and even insulted if I would just leave.\n\nI owe them so much. They took care of me for many years and I can't just leave. My wish right now would be to go away and just live elsewhere for at least a year. The problem though? Christmas is right around the corner. It might be my 88 year old grandma's last one.\n\nWould I be a-hole if I would just leave or should I wait until Christmas?",
