  "post content": "I'm 18f, I have one jacket, leather jacket ive had for 5+ years. Its fucked. Its held together with safety pins, staples and pure spite. Its torn, both outside pockets are ripped and my inside pocket has a hole that i keep losing money in. To be fair, I didn't actually have a jacket before this (lacking parents, grew up in foster care).I  Iove it. I also can't afford a new one so this will do until it can't \n\nI do not, however, like when people point out the issues. One of my classmates kept asking why I dont get a new one when the sleeve is close to falling off and there's holes everywhere. This friend has a dad who works for a major airline and managed to keep his job and a GP for a mother. She doesn't really get not being able to afford something. (Example of this is I said I don't qualify for financial aid for college since I cant declare myself an independent and I don't have parents to list a parent income and she just said take it out of your savings as if i have any). \n\nI told her to stop a few times, and she just kept saying that I get a new one. She's said the same about other things, especially when she came over to my place. But the jacket one annoyed me since this is the most obvious od the problems. After a while I said \"If your really want me to get a new jacket, you fucking pay for it or shut your rich mouth and drop the subject \".\n\nShe was upset, she called me an asshole and said I shouldn't have snapped at her. I don't think I'm an ah here but I may as well get a judgement. AITA?",

You are absolutely being scammed here/something is wrong, if you have no parents and are a foster child how do you not qualify for financial aide due to parents or dependency? And if someone is claiming you as a dependent, then they should be supporting you financially.\n\nAnyway, you need to squeaky wheel (as in the squeaky wheel gets the grease). You need to openly use your past and current situation, e-mail/call/talk to various finical aide, counselors, the office of the ombudsman, etc. Tell them you are a foster child but were still denied for foster aide, your clothing is falling apart and you can't afford it and everyone keeps commenting, and whatever else your financial woes are, and you have no family to help you and are struggling alone. Tell them you don't understand why you don't qualify for financial aide, you feel there must be some mistake, and can they help you? If they can't, say who can you talk to that can help you resolve this issue?\n\nDo NOT accept the first no as a wall you can't get past. I had a friend sort of like you. They were an orphan disowned by other family and had to leave school for a while due to a medical crisis. Then they were having trouble getting back in since the school wanted student loan payments first they could not make. They were told it was absolutely required. But then I wrote a (completely true) very sympathetic letter about their situation, contacted some people, what can we do, who can help them, etc. And it was eventually resolved. They got back into school, graduated. \n\nIf this is real you need to fix this. Keep asking. Keep talking to new people. Keep asking and looking to who else you can talk to. Don't  be ashamed to make them feel  bad for you. Be honest about all of your hardships, spell them out, and say I really need your help, please help me.",

They keep their social worker, often receive stipend checks, and continue receiving money to what's called an \"emancipation account\" which they get access to once they exit foster care, whenever that may be.\n\n\nHowever, our program actually requires these young adults to be working or going to school in order to be eligible for the free housing we provide (they pay their own bills minus rent). And our case workers help them get financial aid and other benefits without any kind of issue at all. If OP is a NMD then the county he's a dependent of shouldn't be blocking any kind of financial aid - most of the county social workers I work with are trying to get any and every support for these young adults while they're in the system!",

From the inside of the jacket lining, use heavy tape to close all the gaps in the leather while trying to line up the edges of the tears as best you can. Use needle and thread (heavy duty thread or 2-4x single thread) and make cross stitches  (very simple stitch where you make a line of Xs in a row: make a line of angled stitches down the line then on the reverse cross the angles with new angles making an X) where you taped. You can get creative by using contrasting thread colors or use the same color as the leather (whatever you prefer or can get your hands on). The tape holds the leather together while you stitch but will also provide reinforcement on the tears and stitches. Once you get the outside done, start with stitching the pockets and lining. If not enough fabric there to work with, you can cut patches out of scraps from donated clothing you can pick up for nothing at donation boxes. When you're done you've made it your own and with today's styles it will look deliberate. Being poor means you have to get creative in all things. I would push on the school aide. Maybe see if you get in to see a lawyer for a free consult for some pro bono representation to go after your government for cutting foster kids loose at 18 with absolutely no support and no assistance until 23.
