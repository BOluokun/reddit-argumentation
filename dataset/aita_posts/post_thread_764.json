  "post content": "My fianc\u00e9 is American, I am French and we are currently spending time in Paris. Today we had my friend wedding where most of the people were French native speakers.\n\nWe arrived at 11am, had a brunch, the wedding ceremony then finish the afternoon by having dinner & talking. Some people spoke a bit with my fianc\u00e9 in english but of course a lot of french was happening. At around 7pm, my fianc\u00e9 said she was tired and thirsty of her zero sugar drink at home and wanted to leave. We left almost right away even if I would have loved to stay longer and enjoy the rest of the day.\n\nOnce at home, we had her sugar-free drink and she started to get dressed and preparing some props for visiting Paris and taking pictures of her (she is doing some photography work). I immediately reacted as I found that unfair that she wanted to go out right now as I though she wanted to rest at home and was tired of the day, and I would have wanted to stay longer at my friend wedding.\n\nShe started sulking and laying silent on bed. I come and cuddle her and said that it's ok we can still go and take her pictures wherever she wants. She got crazy about me saying that and starting to yell about she spend 8 hours in a place with all french speaking person just for me and I should not complain about wanted to go take pictures with her. I stayed calm and try to spoke clearly but unfortunately I got some insults (you are an asshole, go suck your friend d\\*\\*k, and so one) and she throw out some cloth in my face. She started to say that spending 8 hours for me is not enough and I should not be demanding to spend more time at my friends place.\n\nI am really sad about her reaction, but AITA here for saying that?",
