  "post content": "My parents had me (16f) and my sister (14f). We lost our dad a few years ago. My mom has heavily favored my sister since she was born. To the point she has raised my sister to be a pretty shitty person to be around. At least she is to me. Dad noticed it and called mom out and at some point they did therapy where apparently it came to light that the grandmother she named me after, was a person my mom had a lot of resentment toward. Why she named me after her then I will never really know. She claimed not to realize at the time. But she at least has some resentment toward me based on that. She also had some PPD when I was born and claimed the early months with me were a very dark time. \n\nWhenever we fight, she takes my sisters side regardless of what happens. Sister takes food off my plate? Won't get in trouble. If I yell at her for it? I get punished. If I take food off my sisters plate in return? I get punished.\n\nSister takes something from my room? Nothing said. I bang on her door after she locked it and try to get it back? Punished for harassing my sister and making noise.\n\nI tell my mom about this stuff happening? She says something about learning how to share or my sister being the baby or my sister needing more so let it go.\n\nMy sister loves to gloat that mom loves her more. My sister has told me that mom has told her she loves her but tolerates me. My sister told me mom wishes I had died instead of dad. She told me they talk about that stuff. She also told me after dad died mom pulled all the money from my college savings and put it into hers.\n\nMy sister also lies to mom and claims I did stuff when she feels like I didn't get in enough trouble recently. In June she got me grounded for the whole month by breaking her laptop and claiming I had done it. She knew it would be believable too because I resented mom for buying my sister a brand new gaming laptop while I had to buy a really cheap second hand one myself, with money from my birthday and Christmas. Mom didn't even let me say anything and my sister gloated that mom will always believe her over me.\n\nIt came to my mom's attention a few months ago that my sister is struggling in school in a couple of places and she can't seem to catch back up easily. But I always had good grades. I could even graduate early in theory, if my school offered that. They don't. My mom is aware of this from past years. So she told me a couple of weeks ago that I need to start tutoring my sister before she gets into a hole she can't climb out of. I told my mom I won't help my sister. Mom told me I will and it's my duty to help. I told her to spend money on a tutor for her favorite daughter because I won't do a thing to help either of them with this. I told her they don't deserve my help.\n\nMom asked how I could put my sister's future at risk. I shrugged. Mom called me names and slammed a door when she left me. The tension is high because of this and my sister is loving it. AITA?",

You can finally know if they were lies or not. \n\nIf she doesn't deny the allegations tho, just walk out. Stay in the library longer, or think of getting a part-time job.

                      "content": "Dear OP you are NTA and bravo you stood for yourself. I may not have kids but I want to tell you something: You are NOT responsible for your sister's academic progress and you are NOT responsible in tutoring her either. You are actually right that she needs a proper tutor but mum is not listening to you. My sympathy goes to you and I am truly sorry that your mum is parentifying you and treating you badly\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0OP, you may think this is a totally unfair world to you but remember to seek help. Do not suffer in silence but please talk to your teacher, a friend's parent, a school counsellor or someone at a local teen/child community organisation. If you ask them whether you are responsible for sister's academic progress, they will agree with what I said. I want you to remember this: telling a trusted adult about your mistreatment at mum's hand is not airing dirty laundry. Do not let anyone tell you that because anyone who claims that talking to someone about being mistreated by a family member will bring disgrace is actually enabling familial abuse. Speaking out is seeking help\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0You said that you have good grades right? Since you said you are 16 now time is of the essence and you must taken action quickly. Talk to your school counsellor or teacher into looking for grants, scholarships and bursaries that can help you to cover your studies when you enter university or vocational school. Any application to uni or vocational school as well as scholarship approval letters should be posted to a safe address e.g. friend's address, employment address or school address so that mum does not sabotage your chances by hiding the mail or lying to the university that you decline the offer\n\n\n\u00a0Are you also working part-time? If you are, do make sure you talk to your employer or a trusted coworker to get a bit of moral support and at the same time work hard to prove you are a capable part-time worker\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0My next advice to you about what you need to do the moment you turn 18 two years from now: if you plan to move out by the time you turn 18, you best do it at least three or four months before turning 18 by slowly moving out your stuff (e.g. school certificates, awards, clothes) little by little and get your friends to store them temporarily for safe keeping. That way you will not go on panic mode on the day you leave. Crash with friends for a couple weeks or months until you find a suitable place to live and rent\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Make sure you don't just get important documents before leaving but also do a full credit check to make sure your mum is not commiting identity theft under your name to apply for loans or credit cards just to feed your sister. Getting a dented credit history no thanks to identity fraud/theft is no laughing matter. Once you get all that done, do consider seeking legal advice to create a will with ironclad rules to ensure that whatever money you earn right now and in the past few years will not fall into mother and sister should something happen to you\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0When you get out at 18, try and find out if you can change your social security number and protect your bank account too. OP I am not sure if you like the name you were named after your grandmother, if you want to legally change it to make yourself happy then go for it when you are 18. But if you are happy with that name I want you to know this: a name after a person does not define you. Then again it is up to you\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0You wrote about your sister's behaviour right? I bet she behaves the same towards her own schoolmates. Focus on your academics and tell yourself that you are doing it for yourself and sister's failures are none of your responsibilities. Tell yourself that sister is responsible for her actions alone. I can promise you this: one day when you go far in life, she will not progress much. If she and mother deearest blame you for sister's failure, ignore them\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Lastly, don't forget to seek counselling to maintain your mental health as well. Hang in there OP and give us an update\u00a0",

Picture what you want your future to look like and lie lie lie to get there. You can go back to being an honest person after you escape living in hell.\n\nAlso please be very cautious with drugs and alcohol.
