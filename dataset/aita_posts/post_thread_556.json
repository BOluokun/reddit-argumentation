I have seen them sporadically throughout my childhood but haven't had contact with them for about 4 years now.\n\n  \nSo my Grandparents (Mom's side) are having their 50th wedding anniversary in July and most of my family is going. They live on the east coast and I am on the west coast, so flights are not the cheapest. I was planning on going out for the event, but my cousin (dad's side) called me out of the blue and invited me to a family reunion over the fourth of July. Now I haven't seen them for so long so of course I want to go, But I can only afford to take one trip. I go home to see my Mom/Grandparents about three times a year and was just out there for mothers-day, so I chose to go to the family reunion. \n\nWhen I told my mom she was PISSED, like really mad. I understand that a 50th wedding anniversary is a big deal and I would love to go to it, but I just don't think I can pass up an opportunity to reconnect with the other side of my family.\n\n  \nAm I the ass hole here?",
