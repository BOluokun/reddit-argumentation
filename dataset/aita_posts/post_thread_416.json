  "post content": "\n\nMy wife and I had our babyboy 5 weeks ago. Everythibg's going fine, no health problems or complications whatsoever. However, my wife is often exhausted so I let my mom come over to help out with cleaning and stuff (I can barely have time to work) and also, at the same time, Spend time with the baby and bond with him a little bit.\n\n\nThing is my wife acts strange whenever she sees my mom with our son. She'd make a face and talk to her in a descending tone, even raises her voice at her causing mom to feel hurt. I asked my wife about it and she said it was because of what my mom is doing. I asked her to elaporate and she complained about mom holding the baby for long and taking forever to give him back to her. mom argued that my wife could ask nicely instead of outright yelling but my wife defended herself saying that she only starts raising her voice after she's already asked a couple of times and mom won't listen. They started arguing and mom started crying. that's when I felt enraged,  pulled my wife aside and told her to stop acting out and that if she keeps this up then we won't get anymore help from mom. She argued that she was trying to feed our son and that it was awful of me to think of it as \"acting out\". I said I understood her frustration and yes mom can do things that require some patience from us. but a little kindness can go a long way in keeping the peace in this difficult time. She called me selfish and said that it's easy for me to say when I'm not the one \"dealing with this\". from there the argument escalated despite me trying to cut it short. I went outside to calm down and after that my wife started cold shouldering me. I told her this was not okay but she told me to go sc*ew myself and that from now on out I should deal with taking our son back from my mom when it's time for feeding since I \"condone\" this behabior.\n\nI really am not condoning anything and really think she's stressed out yes but the way she behaves around mom is, in my opinion, not okay.\n\n\nETM:: My goodness! I'm seeing so much anger here. I'm sorry I can not respond to you all but I just want people to calm down and understand that I in no way  agree with some of my mom's behaviors, just how my wife reacts is......not okay and that's all. really. thank you very much though! Ok. have a nice day.",

Puh-leeeeeeeeeeze.\n\nIt's pretty clear you're letting your mother run roughshod over your wife, and you're doubling down by saying she should manage her reaction. You need to get control of your mother, apologize to your wife profusely, and start directly helping out with your son and household. Yesterday.\n\nETA: Verdict.\n\nINFO: What is your mother actually doing to help out you and your wife, in regards to cleaning and household management?\n\nIf by \"helping\" you mean holding the baby while your wife takes care of all the household drudgery...that isn't helping.",

Relaxin starts right away in a pregnancy, because the uterus needs to grow right away, and reaches a peak level in time for the main event. Relaxin is the reason pregnant people aren\u2019t supposed to do heavy lifting - too easy to dislocate something.\n\nBut! Relaxin does not leave the body immediately! It stays in the parent\u2019s body for up to a year!\n\nI have heard horror stories of parents going back to exercise too early to drop the baby weight, and permanently fucking up their joints. The ligaments that hold our bones in place aren\u2019t ready for a normal load. Personally I\u2019m nearly a year postpartum and I still have pregnancy posture (though this is aggravated by many things, primarily not finding time for my preferred exercise). Tried doing a minor ab exercise the other day and I was physically incapable, even though I did it fine pre-pregnancy. It sucks.\n\nSo on top of everything else (dinner plate sized wound!!!) her bones don\u2019t wanna stay together yet \ud83d\ude43 give the woman her damn baby already",

There were a couple of people that did try and take advantage of me and my most vulnerable and it did mess me up. Honestly, 7 years later I still have my guard up around them and it\u2019s a shame.\n\nYou are putting your mother ahead of your wife. Your wife just had a baby and needs time to bond with her own baby as well as rest. Having to deal with your mother regularly and deal with her not giving her baby back, comments and whatever BS you consider small is going to cut your wife so much more.\n\nYour wife has enough energy to be a new mum, taking care of her baby and herself. Nothing more. You are a major major AH asking her to have patience for your mother.\n\nHonestly, your wife will not forget this. I\u2019d be surprised if she wanted any more babies after this.\n\nMy friend went through this and the only way they had baby number two was after intense marital counselling and the mother in law staying in a hotel 2 weeks after the new baby arrived. Visits were 2 hours max. They\u2019re still married and happy now.",

Just clean the house, make dinner, and let us care for the tiny human for a few months until we are safe and viable. Stop choosing your mother's wants over our needs. This is not a transaction if mother wants to help then help, with no strings attached. If it is just an excuse to swan in and hold a baby, then GTFO.",
