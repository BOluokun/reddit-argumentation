  "post content": "\n\nI (m28) have been with my fiancee (f30) for a year an a half. I have a stepson (4) that I adore and treat as my own.\n\n\nMy older brother's wedding is soon. I was intending on going but after I found out that my stepson was not invited, we started having issues. My brother explained that it's the nature of the wedding they chose which is child free but my fiancee was upset that this rule was forced on family as well. She got into arguments with my brother and his fiancee and ended up deciding to not go to the wedding. As a result I called my brother and told I no longer want to come after what happened. He began arguing saying my fiancee is the one being unreasonable and now has \"convinced\" me to miss his wedding. I told him that this is just me supporting my family after the way he and his fiancee treated them. His fiancee said they don't owe us anything and that this is a wedding rule that applied to everyone. I said \"fine then I'm not coming\". My brother is pissed my parents are calling me unreasonable for being willing to miss my only sibling's wedding and basically let a woman I've only known for a year an half drive a wedge between us. They said if I go through with this then I might lose my brother, who's my support and comfort forever, and so much damage and hurt will come out of this.\n\n\nI stopped responding to them but members of extended family are saying that me and my fiancee are creating the problem trying to control my brother's wedding.",

Your stepson wasn\u2019t targeted - it\u2019s a CHILD FREE wedding (which is becoming more & more the norm given how some people allow their children to act).\n\nThere is NO logic to getting irritated that family children are not excluded from the rule. Since the majority of wedding guests ARE family, what is the point of making a wedding child-free, but then excluding almost all guests from the rule? That would make NO sense. NONE.\n\nThis had NOTHING to do with your stepson - but you & your fianc\u00e9 tried to make it personal. Since I cannot believe you found your fianc\u00e9\u2019s gaslighting (trying to pretend children of family should all be entitled to attend regardless of the rules) to be an actual legitimate argument, I can only assume that you chose to back up her ridiculous position to prove your loyalty to her & the boy (rather than actually believing she had any real leg to stand on).\n\nI\u2019m glad your brother is finding out how quick you are willing to shank him to validate your position in your own relationship.

I went to a wedding a couple years ago that was supposed to be child free, but they made leeway for one of the guests whose babysitter backed out last-minute, for their five year old.

And the parents made no effort to take him outside of the hall, where he would not be a distraction during all the speeches, and everything that were happening at the tail end of dinner. It was incredibly fucking rude on the parents behalf, considering they were given leeway, and had made many promises about how well behaved the kid would be. [See my comment here for explanation on why the kid was attending, and why none of us made a big deal during the nuclear meltdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4j7te/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_brothers_wedding/ixuq26v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)\n\n\nThis is only one instance of something like this happening and I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of thousands of similar stories of people making an exception to a child for a wedding and then the kid has a full fucking meltdown and ruins part of the night. People are allowed to want child free spaces as adults. Sometimes you just wanna get drunk and celebrate and not have to worry about keeping an eye on all the kids. \n\n\nOP and his fianc\u00e9e are massively entitled to take this as a personal attackwhen it\u2019s a blanket rule for everybody attending",

Check all that apply.\n \n     __ Is very quiet during meaningful ceremonies that\n          involve content he can\u2019t possibly understand. \n     __ Loves to sit still at long dinner receptions where\n          expensive adult food is served.\n     __ Frequently engages in adult conversation.\n     __ Allows the invited parent to celebrate the couple\n          late into the evening because he doesn\u2019t require\n          constant supervision. \n\nHmm, that\u2019s right. This is an event for loved ones to celebrate someone\u2019s marriage; not a family party.",

I have a 4 year old and if never dream of bringing her to a wedding neither she, nor myself would enjoy it and likely would end up disrupting the ceremony. You can only keep a 4 year old still and quiet for so long. OP, you and your fianc\u00e9e are childish and being very unreasonable.",
