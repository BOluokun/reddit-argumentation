  "post content": "So super weird situation and need a judgement. I (32M) have been engaged to Amanda (34F) for about a year, we dated for 3. She has a 12 year old daughter named Alexis. Me and Alexis have a good relationship. Me, Amanda and her ex all have a good relationship for the most part. I\u2019m totally comfortable with my role. So Amanda, her ex and Alexis have this weird thing they do. They all get together on Sundays and hangout the three of them. I guess it started as a family tradition and then once they divorced they kept it going. They make breakfast, watch movies and just hang around all day together. I find it really weird tbh. Like I\u2019m not insecure about it, but why you would want to spend a day a week with your ex is beyond me. I said how weird I found this when we started dating but Amanda said that Alexis looks forward to it weekly so she never stopped it. So at first I would just hang in our room or the basement all Sunday. But I got tired of being trapped in my own house so I started leaving the whole day. Amanda would never ask where I was going or anything. Wouldn\u2019t even notice I was gone. \n\nSo at first I was golfing or getting errands done. Or would find a bar. But then I reconnected with my old friend Bella. Bella and me dated 5 years ago and have remained good friends since. She just broke up with her husband and moved into a new apartment. I told her one Sunday that I was just planning on going to the movies and she instead invited me over. We smoked some weed, watched some movies, cooked and just hung out. It was nice and ever since it\u2019s become my weekly tradition. Whenever Sunday would come I\u2019d head over to Bella\u2019s and we\u2019d just hangout all day. \n\nI didn\u2019t see the need to bring up to Amanda where I was going. She never asked or even wondered where I was every Sunday. So yesterday Bella stopped by our house to drop off my phone charger because I left it at her place. Amanda asked why Bella had my phone charger. And I told her that it\u2019s where I was on Sunday. She asked why I was there and I told her that was my Sunday hangout spot. She flipped out. Saying how rude it was to not let her know I was hanging out with an ex. I laughed and said \u201cdo you really not see the irony with that statement\u201d. She said it\u2019s different because she was forthcoming about her/ex\u2019s relationship and that if I had an issue with it then I should have said so. I said I did already bring it up and that she said it was important to her daughter. Was I supposed to interfere with the highlight of her daughters week in order to make myself feel better? No I\u2019ll just sneak out the back door and head to my friends house. And that I didn\u2019t see why this was even an issue at all. We trust each other and are adults. Amanda doesn\u2019t want me over there anymore and said she wants me to find another way to spend my Sundays. I said then I don\u2019t want your ex over here on Sundays anymore if that\u2019s how we\u2019re playing this. AITA?\n\nUpdate: some shit has already hit the fan with the whole situation. I\u2019ve put my foot down and said I\u2019m not being forced out of my house anymore. That they can do Sunday funday at her ex\u2019s place moving forward. I\u2019ll post a complete update when I can. I did want to clarify that the reason I don\u2019t hang out with them is that I was asked not to at first. Then I always felt awkward about the whole thing. So at first I stayed away because I was asked, then I felt like the fourth wheel so I decided to quit trying. Bella has really helped because she went through something similar with her SO.",
