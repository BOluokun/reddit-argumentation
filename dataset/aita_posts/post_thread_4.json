  "post content": "My fiance (31m) and I (28f) have two girls aged 4&2. Last year I had a stillborn baby daughter. I said I never wanted to be pregnant again. It hit me really hard and I've never known pain like it. \n\nApparently, your super fertile after a loss and I ended up falling pregnant immediately after our loss and I'm currently 8 month pregnant with a boy. Something my fiance really wanted.\n\nI hate being pregnant. Never enjoyed it. I hate even more how long I've been pregnant due to the back to back pregnancies. I'm miserable and I never want to be pregnant again.\n\nIn the unlikely event the baby I'm carrying now does also die I never want to be pregnant again. If the baby lives I never want to be pregnant again. I honestly can't explain how much I hate being pregnant. I love babies, children etc. Not pregnancy. My eldest two girls and this baby are all c sections which is tough. I gave up work to be a sahm but I'm looking forward to when this one starts school and I can get back to work.\nI hate how sick, tired and achey I feel. I'm short tempered with my other children. I'm fat and saggy. I poop constantly. My mental healths taken a complete beating - I've been in counselling for nearly a year now and feeling better though. \n\nAnyway. My consultant offerered to cut my fallopian tubes during my next c section making me infertile. I said yes of course, just check with my fiance.\nHe is very against it. I don't feel comfortable doing something permanent that effects him too without his support but equilly ill never forgive him if I fall pregnant again. \n\nHe says I'm making a decision based on anger that's I've essentially been pregnant for 14 months now.\n\nWIBTA if I agreed to be steralised - taking away also his choice of having any more children - because that's what I want?\n\nAlso to add, we've discussed me using the coil but there's no birth control that's 100% effective.\n\nEdit: this has gotten more attention than I thought it would. I haven't had the chance to read all replies yet as been doing kids baths dinner etc, still need to get them to bed so will read every reply later.\nJust to answer a few questions that have come up so far. I wasn't sure how much info to add in my original post to not be rambly. \n\nFiance had always said as one of 4 he loved the madness and would want 4. I always said 4 was too many but we said we'd see how we feel after 3. We had never anticipated a still born and that steralisiation would be an option.\n\nThis past year he's been my absolute rock. He also lost a baby, but he had to hold it together while I fell apart. He's a fantastic father. This isn't a walk away from our family matter.\n\nHe's a bit of a stereotypical man in that he doesn't do talking about feelings, this is how he's always been and I accept that. He has so many other fantastic qualities. An example would be when choosing the music for our daughters funeral. He simply refused to pick. It upset him too much. You could say this is an ass hole move, however while I sat inside crying he was outside on the tranmpoline with our other 2 young children making them shriek with laughter, protecting them as best as he could.\n\nI know in a way this is above this sub, because he's not an asshole, but I didn't want relationship advice. I just wanted to know if I would be crossing a line by doing it without his full support.\n\nIf I say I'm getting it done, he won't stop me. But he will resent me. If I don't get it done, I will resent him. \n\nHis main concern is that its extra surgery with extra risks. Second that I'm not my usual self (I'm not - I am a raging hormonal mess, with a dose of ptsd, anxiety and depression to boot thanks to our loss - however I have a fantastic counsellor and things have greatly improved). Third he says there's other forms of contraception that isn't permanent. Forth is my age. \n\nAnd I've had 2 c sections. 1 emergency, 1 planned. Our stillborn was delivered naturally as she was premature and small so not the same risks. I have my third c section booked for the end of the month. I need to give an answer on Wednesday if I want the tubal tie at the same time and we are still in disagreement, so one of us will be upset. I wanted to see if I was being an asshole for choosing my choice, of permanent steralisiation over his suggestion of the coil. \nSo far it seems from comments that I'm not and I really appreciate all the replies. I will read them all xxx\n\nEdit 2. Guys I was asking if I would be an asshole not if fiance is an asshole and I'm beginning to feel very protective over him with some of the comments. I'm not a baby factory in the same way he's not a sperm doner. We love each other and respect each other we just have a difference of opinion on a huge matter and we've ran out of time. Whilst I'm really pleased it seems everyone is agreeing with me he's a good guy too. Everything he does is for us. He's hardworking, loving and fun. He helps me with the kids after a day of manual work. He does baths and the park. He rubs my back, sends me off for baths when I ache. Let's me sleep in, or nap due to pregnancy tiredness.\nLeaving us over this wouldn't of even entered his mind nor is it a concern of mine. We survived a stillbirth while raising 2 other young children, as a team, filling their life with joy despite the pain. We can survive anything if we've made it through the last 18 odd months x",

If it\u2019s a stranger at some work event, they\u2019re just making small talk and they don\u2019t want to get into my personal tragedies, nor do I in the moment. The counselor suggested that if I feel guilty for saying I have two children rather than three, I should just say an apology in my head to my first. \n\nShe suggested I look at it as a way of protecting myself, and the memory of my child. \n\nBy the way, OP, since I\u2019m telling you this, I will also tell you that when I asked my OB for a tubal, she started to ask me her standard question - if you lost one of your children, are you sure you wouldn\u2019t want to have another? - but stopped herself because she said if anyone absolutely knew the answer to that question, it was me.

I wanted to just mention one scenario where I think you and your husband could compromise with each other. I'm not sure if others have recommended this, but have you all considered adoption? It sounds like your biggest concerns with having another child is going through the pregnancy and the potential for the child to be stillborn. If you adopt, obviously you wouldnt be going through the pregnancy process, and the child you're adopting is already alive and presumably healthy. This would still allow your husband to have the four children he really wants. The bonus is you have the chance to make a massive difference in a young child's life by pulling them out of foster care and giving them a place to call home. My sister had hodgkins lymphoma cancer as a child and it caused irreversible damage to her ovaries and she had no other options but adopting. Her two kids are wonderful and they love each other just as much as any \"normal\" family. It's an option to consider.",

If OP says she is done, she\u2019s done. I know this might sound cruel, but it doesn\u2019t fucking matter what the fianc\u00e9 thinks.    \n\nHe\u2019s not the one who has to carry the baby for 9 months. He isn\u2019t the one who has to get surgery just to deliver the baby. He\u2019s not the one risking his life to have these babies. And he\u2019s not the one who has experienced back-to-back pregnancies while taking care of babies they already have.   \n\nThis will be baby #3. OP, if you happen to see this, my advice is to get the tubal ligation if you want it. While you are being very generous by consulting your fianc\u00e9 on the matter, this is your choice, period.   \n\nHe\u2019s entitled to his opinion. He\u2019s not entitled to force you into more pregnancies that you are comfortable with. You need to sit him down and tell him this is happening whether he likes it or not.   \n\nNTA for choosing tubal ligation. I firmly believe that is a right every woman has to decide for herself. Even taking away the miscarriage, having 3 babies that close together, it\u2019s still acceptable to say you don\u2019t want a 4th or 5th (where the risk can get higher and higher your health may suffer).",

Your body, your choice.\n\nBut is your husband telling you he expects more kids? Is he afraid of you getting more surgery? Is he grieving your recent losses? It's not clear to me where exactly his head is at or what he's telling you beyond \"he's against surgery\" and said you're \"making this decision out of anger.\"\n\nCan you clarify? What exactly did he tell you? And did you tell him exactly what you've told us?",

Then go get the procedure done and it's up to your fiance to decide rather or not he stays too.  \n\nThis is a giant decision and it affects both of you extremely greatly.  Hopefully your fiance sees your reasoning and pain and understands.  However, this is the topic, kids, is one of the biggest reasons for divorce.  So plan for the worst, and hope for the best.\n\nI don't know why people are calling the fiance an asshole purely for saying he wants more kids.

He has even suggested a different form of birthcontrol for the time being.  \n\nDon't get the essure.  If it's what I think it is it's very unsafe and doctors urge you now not to get this.

The husband is correct in that OP might be making a relatively hasty decision due to currently being pregnant and having back to back pregnancies. \n\nLet the pregnancy hormones subside.

But I also don't like being pregnant! \n\nYes, I am looking forward to my future child, but I hate not being in control of my body, having the weird alien feeling of his movements, obnoxious heartburn and loss of appetite when I'm an avid food lover (actually, a bit addicted, if I'm gonna be honest), restrictions on working out when I had *just* accomplished losing 20 pounds right before pregnancy...etc etc. I've been fairly open about disliking being pregnant, and there are a few women in my office find it refreshing. I try to continue being open about my dislike of pregnancy because of this, since I'm already kinda considered a grumpy tomboy by half the office haha.\n\nI've found that in my instance, the most vocal ones that look down on talking about the bad side of pregnancy are the ones who consider it to be their ultimate goal in life, a sacred mission that they're fulfilling...something to be proudly stoic about. But then again, I live in the south, so people are heavily biased towards the \"barefoot and pregnant\" lifestyle.\n\n**EDIT**: Also my sincere condolences to the shit parts of your pregnancy, that SUCKS and is even worse when you're looked down on for sharing your struggles! I'm a big baby in comparison...I asked my husband how he would feel if this was our only child, because I hate being pregnant, and he very sweetly said he would be disappointed, but would understand and support me.

Monetarily, especially in the US, hospital costs for a C-section (and raising a kid in general) are already super expensive, and there are ways to help with adoption costs (grants, etc) and fostering can be free. Agencies will evaluate based on your readiness and ability to raise another child, if you consistently get no's from everywhere it's for a reason and you maybe shouldn't have that extra kid in the first place.

Do grants and tax credits lower this cost so it\u2019s at least somewhat comparable to the cost of a c-section?\n\nTrue, fostering is free. But I don\u2019t think everyone is cut out to be a good foster parent (or adoptive parent, for that matter).\n\nI think agencies (rightfully) have a relatively high bar for prospective adoptive parents to meet. Depending on the parents\u2019 financial lifestyle, I could see a situation where they could comfortably raise a fourth kid, but be rejected by an agency.",
