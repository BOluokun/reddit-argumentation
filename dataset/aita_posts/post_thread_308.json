  "post content": "My son (24M) and his girlfriend (24F) have only been together for 6 months, and she is apparently 4 months pregnant with his baby. They have actually been friends since high school, and so my husband and I have known her for a few years as well. \n\nShe is a lovely girl, but honestly she is not someone I had hoped would be the mother to my first grandchild. First of all, she is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, and while she says she has been clean for 3 years, a relapse is always possible. She only finished high school with her GED, and she now works as a waitress full time. Her parents died years ago, so she is largely on her own.\n\nOur family is considerably better off, and my son is joining his father's business, meaning his salary will be quite high and will only continue to grow. \n\nSince my son first told us she is pregnant, it can't escape my mind that he may not really he the father, and that she picked him out of potential others because he would be the \"best\" in terms of support. \n\nMy son is pushing us to help her with some of her pregnancy expenses, and I told him we would under the condition that she get a paternity test first. He completely blew up at that, accusing us of disliking her (untrue) and not wanting to he grandparents (also untrue). He says he loves her and trusts her and that he can't wait to meet his baby. I get that, but I think he's being idealistic. If he wants our support, we want a paternity test first. If the baby is truly his then we would be happy to welcome her into our family and we would be happy to help her out. AITA?\n\nEdit: there are 7k replies to this post, and over 200 private messages in my inbox that I can't reply to. It's a pretty even mix of YTA and NTA, so clearly the only thing everyone can agree with is that it's complicated. I've gotten messages to kill myself, I've gotten messages calling my son an idiot, and I have gotten messages from the MGTOW subreddit telling me that the girlfriend is clearly a lying sociopath. I have also gotten a lot of messages from men who found out their child wasn't theirs after several years, who wish they had found out sooner. \n\nIt's a lot to read, and a lot to think about. Many people have called out my attitude towards this girl and I'll be honest, it is making me think.",

          "content": "Agreed, YTA. OP, your son loves her and wants to be with her and *believes this is his child*. If you have the money available (and would\u2019ve helped if it was someone you \u201capproved\u201d) then support your son *and his soon to be family*. No one is saying throw millions at it, go into debt, or write them into the will.\n\nETA something i just commented below:\n\n>Would OP want a paternity test if the situation was different? If the girl hadn't been drug addict?\n\nExactly. If the girl was Polly Purebred with a perfect pedigree would OP have asked for a paternity test before helping? Not to mention, asking for a paternity test now is questioning the integrity of the people involved (son and gf) and in no world does that not make OP an asshole **to them**. \n\nThere are too many other variables going on - they\u2019ve known each other since high school, who knows what kind of relationship they\u2019ve had or how much son tells OP. It\u2019s irrelevant if they\u2019ve been FWB and started a relationship, or have been friends for years and started a relationship, or had a one night stand turn into something more. They\u2019re already past the first trimester. They\u2019re in a relationship. They\u2019re having a baby. \n\nSon asking mom to help out with a few expenses - not the asshole. Mom declining to help because she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable doing so - not the asshole. Mom/OP putting the stipulation of a paternity test before helping - asshole.",

              "content": "Hey, I'm not going to say you're an asshole, but I want you to hear what I have to say. \n\nAt 18, I was a senior in high school and met a guy I began what was supposed to be a fling before I went to college the next year. Despite birth control, I got pregnant either the first or second time we had sex. He was a pothead with no job. We were both from low income families. \n\nRumors started flowing through his family and friend group about 2 months in, that I was trying to pin the twins on him and they belonged to a friend of mine. By 4 months, he had ghosted, I had basically told him to either make myself and our unborn children his priority or get lost and I'd call him when I went into labor. I was finishing highschool with straight A's. I felt like a loser because my child's father was a worthless deadbeat. It was extremely mentally stressful.\n\nI went into labor at 24 weeks, gave birth via csection at a rural hospital without the supplies needed for micropreemie care. He showed up drunk not long after I woke up from anesthesia and was welcomed in by my family because the girls' prognosis wasn't good. \n\nThe hospital kept my babies alive until a larger hospital could come get them. I allowed him to stay with me in the hospital because I didn't want to be alone, while I was doped up, he tried to convince me to change their last names to his instead of mine, which I refused. That next night, we received the call that twin A had a massive brain hemorrhage and wouldn't live long enough for us to get there to say goodbye. I left AMA to get to her, my relative drove us the 3 hour trip. \n\nTwo days later, his mom and dad come, they see my critically ill babies, fighting for life, and his father quietly tells him after they leave the room that he needed a paternity test asap and not to sign any papers or give me any money or support until that happened (remember how I said he was unemployed and broke? Yeah, MY family was the ones helping us). I felt disgusted at them, my babies were fighting for their next heartbeat, not expected to survive, and he's worried about paternity?!\n\nIt was a continuous discussion for the next two weeks he was there, I welcomed the paternity test, but he had to pay for it and the hospital wouldn't do it. He could have begged his parents for the $100 to get a test done, but he didn't. \n\nHe left when they were 2 weeks old, returned once when twin A had a crisis and was expected to die, left after a few days, and returned again once more when she was getting her trach put in and I needed him to get training to care for her or she wouldn't be allowed to come home, (there had to be 2 people, and no one else would do it). He left again and she died in the hospital at 6 months, a month after her twin was discharged. \n\nI personally drove to his home to invite him to her funeral, told him the day and time, and let him know that the funeral home wouldn't publish her obituary including his name or his family's name unless he came and gave permission. \n\nHe didn't show, neither did his family. His best friend that introduced us came and I appreciated him coming to acknowledge her and her twin. When asked directly after the funeral via text why he couldn't even honor her in death, he replied that it was his mother's birthday and he had plans already. \n\n2 months later the paternity test came back on my surviving twin, positive of course, no apologies from his family for their disgusting behavior. But I made him suffer, not for doubting me, I understood that, but for dishonoring my now dead child by denying her a father her entire life and I her death, she didn't deserve that. I made him look at her pictures and her ashes, and told him that wasn't his daughter because he threw her away, she was so sick and needed him and he threw her away. \n\nTo this day, no one in his family is allowed to claim my oldest daughter, she is mine and mine alone. I have a strained relationship at best with them, best with his mother after I made her sob in despair over the life of my oldest daughter that meant so little to her, made her realize how badly she messed up, that she'd tossed her grandchild in the garbage metaphorically and that I'd never forgive it and that she'd never have the privilege to claim her. My oldest daughter died without a father on her birth certificate, legally, she doesn't have one and she never will. \n\nI tell you all this because you underestimate the hatred a mother can have if she feels you've hurt her babies. Your behavior can directly affect not only your relationship with your son, but your grandchild, because if something happens to that baby, the mother will never forget your rejection, it will eat her up and make her hate you. \n\nIt seems to me that the safest bet you can make is to apologize and help. If the baby is your son's, then you begin with a good relationship, if the baby isn't, then you're out a couple thousand but get to maintain your dignity and integrity. Either way, if you reject this baby right now, it will strain the relationship with your child and possibly break it.\n\nETA- OP, what I really want you to think about is this, do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? I don't forsee rejecting this baby as anything that will bring you happiness.",

In some ways, it's easier for those people to have a dead baby than a sick baby, you don't have to live in limbo or invest part of your soul into someone that might leave you. I was the opposite team (I've noticed it's usually complete rejection of sick babies, or complete obsession, very little in between), I HAD to invest my entire existence into them, I had to let them know how precious and important they are, I had to do everything I could to convince them to keep fighting and stay with me.",

First of all, she is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, and while she says she has been clean for 3 years, a relapse is always possible. She only finished high school with her GED, and she now works as a waitress full time. Her parents died years ago, so she is largely on her own.\n\nYou sound very judgmental of this young lady who apparently has had a rough go of it (how long has she been an orphan and was she brought up in the foster care system? That is a difficult life for a child). She was an addict in her teens/early adulthood and has turned that around, which is a sign of strength and resilience; of course a relapse is always possible but it sounds more to me like her upbringing caused some struggles with substance abuse and she has now grown. I don't see any reason other than a vague assumption for you to believe this will be an issue. And she doesn't have a lucrative job, so what? Being a server is a valuable job and not everyone needs or wants to go into debt for secondary education. Not everyone wants to be a high earner either, and that's nothing to look down upon. It also doesn't make someone automatically a gold digger because the person they are with does have high earning potential. Also, I think it's a bit hypocritical that you're judging her for her job when your son's career is being handed to him by you and your husband.\n\nI don't see anything to indicate that she is trying to use your son or that she has been sleeping around. Yes, they are probably rushing into the choice to raise a child together after only six months, but they've been friends for years and your son trusts her character. You seem to believe this is a possibility solely because of her lower class background and education/job.\n\nYou are not TA for choosing whether or not you support them financially. But your son has made it clear that he will not tolerate the insinuation that she is cheating on and lying to him, and I applaud him for that. Either help them or don't, but this condition is clearly not going to be met so you need to drop it.",

She\u2019s gotten her GED, been sober for 3 years, and has lived through the struggles and trauma associated with losing her parents.
