  "post content": "Context: sister (29F) has had a dog for about a year now. She is (meant to be) the sole carer of the dog and he is her responsibility entirely. This was the agreement as no one else at home wanted a dog. \n\nEDIT: Important stuff I think is important to understand my position, but in no way excuse me. When we first got the dog, my sister would leave him in a locked play pen all day. He would bark and cry. If I had a break that day id take him outside to sit in the sun, use the bathroom etc. After 9 months of this I told my sister she had to find somewhere else for him to stay throughout the day. I said this as he deserves to be out and playing like a normal dog. She still refused and thought he was fine, so I told her that I would no longer take him out (including bathroom breaks) which meant she HAD to find a new, safe space for him to stay throughout the day. She refused to put him anywhere else, but she would call me throughout the day asking me to take him out. \n\n \nThis dog barks all day, endlessly. I work from home and take calls with customers and colleagues, and he can be heard through the phone, whereas my sister goes into the office. She leaves him locked in the laundry when she's not home. My room has an attaching chute to the laundry so I can very clearly hear this dog whenever he barks/cries. His living conditions are bad in my opinion, he doesn't get to run around during the day, feel the sun or be a normal dog. I've told her it's inhumane to leave him like that, she doesn't listen. \n\nI asked her to find somewhere else for him to stay, not in the laundry, so that I don't have to listen to him cry all day. He's gonna cry and bark regardless because of his circumstances, I just don't want to hear it all day.\n \nNow in this past year, I've learned what triggers my dog. The main thing is bassy music. He doesn't understand it and just barks. I have chosen the warpath\n\nBecause my sister has just blatantly disregarded his barking and my problem with it, I've decided to start triggering my dog when she's home. She's told me to \"just put headphones in and drown him out\". I decided that headphones wont work because i dont want to wear them all day, so the next best thing is music loud enough to drown him out \n\nI'll play loud bassy music outside my room with the door closed. I'll also knock on my desk occasionally to mimic someone knocking at the front door (dog will bark for 20 mins if someone is at the front door and knocking).\n\nHere's the real kicker. When she is home, if he barks for more than 5 minutes straight, she will go nuts and tell him to shut up. She can't stand his barking for 5 mins, but she expects me to just suck it up for 8+ hours a day. This is the exact reason I've chosen this revenge. \n\nSo, AITA for driving my dog crazy while my sister is home?\n\nEdit: I know what I'm doing is really shitty. I really don't know what else to do. If anyone has any other ideas to get my sister to understand that the barking all day isn't okay? I've already spoken to her about professional trainers, staying consistent with training, and even rehoming when nothing has worked.\n\nTo those who have said \"just take the dog out when hes in distress\", I used to do this, but this enabled my sister to keep passing off responsibility and not actually do anything to change his circumstances, which is why I have since stopped doing anything for the dog\n\nFINAL EDIT: Yall have gotten to me. Im gonna stop riling the dog up when my sisters home. I will figure out a way to fuck with my sister directly without collateral. I only came up with this plan a few days ago and I know I was blinded by my frustration, so thank you for destroying any ego I had towards this matter. I admit that my frustration caused me to view the dog as a pawn and not really consider the effects this has on the dog. I will try to be better for the dog. Thank you kind assholes (/s) of the internet for forcing me to quit my bullshit and  forcing me to learn how to deal with this in an appropriate, mature manner",
