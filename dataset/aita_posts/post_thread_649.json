  "post content": "My family and I got into a road accident a few weeks ago.  Everyone is fine, but I broke my leg in two places.  \n\nThe doctor gave me the ok to go back to school.  I\u2019m (17F) am in a bunch of AP classes and have a lot of books I have to carry with me. It\u2019s hard going between my locker to class because it\u2019s hard to manage a heavy backpack with crutches and a bulky cast.\n\nLast Tuesday, one of my classes ran late.  I was with my boyfriend Josh, who shares both classes with me.  Josh is a heavy guy who prides himself on being in unathletic because why need sports when you have video games?\n\nWe\u2019re running to the next class.  I can\u2019t keep up because crutches and heavy backpack make it freaking hard. I asked Josh if he could help me carry some of my books.  He said he can\u2019t because he can\u2019t carry my books plus his. I end up late to class by ten minutes when Josh was on time.\n\nMs. Sanchez, my teacher, is chastising me for being late.  And I snapped, \u201cwell, if Josh wasn\u2019t so out of shape and would help me, I wouldn\u2019t be late!\u201d\n\nI got detention for talking back to the teacher.  And my friends and classmates think try at I\u2019m an asshole for fat shaming Josh.  Josh says I\u2019m unfair to him because I know he\u2019s out of shape, and can\u2019t help me.  I\u2019m just sick of being let down by him all the time! AITA?  Or should I try to be more understanding?\n\nEdit:  we don\u2019t have any turtle patrol, so my teachers haven\u2019t been all that accommodating.  My mom was pissed about the detention and has been hammering the principal and superintendents ear.  Until then, I\u2019m learning go remotely.  She thinks the detention is bs.\n\nAs for my ex, I dumped him a few hours ago.  Then he blew up my phone to call me a fucking bitch.  Turns out word got around to his parents.  His parents are hardcore conservatives who think that guys have to help a lady no matter what.  His dad confiscated his Xbox until further notice.\n\nI blocked his number.  Good riddance.\n\nI\u2019m just going to focus the rest of senior year getting use of my leg back and getting out of here.  Josh sucks and I can\u2019t believe I dated that loser.\n\nEdit 2: Wow, the comments here.  I stand by my choice.  Fuck Josh.  Fuck my school.  I'm going to be graduating in eight months and moving onto better things.  He had it coming when his xbox got confiscated.  Maybe he'll learn to be a better boyfriend.  \n\nPeace out!!!
