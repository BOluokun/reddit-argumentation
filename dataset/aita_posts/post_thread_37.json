  "post content": "So, to celebrate my son\u2019s graduation and with most people around here being vaccinated I took the family to the local hibachi for some dinner.  \n\nMy family of four sits down and soon we are joined by another family of four.  They are nice enough and when the time comes to order, the father says that one of his daughters has a dairy allergy and asks that her food be made without butter.  The waitress says \u201cNo problem, we will make everyone\u2019s without butter\u201d.   The father says, her allergy isn\u2019t that serious and as long as her serving has no dairy, it should be fine.  The waitress repeats \u201cWe will make all the food at the table without butter\u201d.  I say that we would like butter with ours.  She replies \u201cSorry, at hibachi we make all of the food together and we cannot risk her getting sick so all of the food needs to be made without butter\u201d.  \n\nI reply that we are not even together.  Plus, I say you can make her food in the back.  There is no rule that the food needs to be made together.  The father agrees with me and says they do it all the time.  At this point, the waitress says they are very busy and they can\u2019t do that.  So I got up and said we are leaving because someone else\u2019s allergy should not affect my dining experience. Then we went to a different hibachi restaurant 10 minutes away.  My wife says that I was an a-hole because I ruined my son\u2019s graduation dinner and I should have been more thoughtful to the girl\u2019s needs.  Plus, now the other restaurant has lost a reservation.  My point is that the girl\u2019s needs could have been met in other ways by the restaurant.  Plus, my son likes his butter.",

I think that tells us a lot - it's definitely all about the dad here. Seems like everyone is shitty except the other parent and daughter.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the awards, kind redditors!",
