  "post content": "I (30f) am a teacher. I have a class with 24 students. I teach 1st grade. \n\nI told my students that we could have a barbecue at a park (with hotdogs and hamburgers and snacks) for whoever filled their \u201cgood noodle\u201d sticker charts. This has been approved by the principal and I teach at a private school. \n\nWe have daily sticker charts to track their behavior in school. They had to have perfect behavior all of April in order to participate. \n\nI have one student who has some behavioral issues. They did not earn all of their good noodle stickers this month. Since this student - we\u2019ll call Bobby - didn\u2019t earn the barbecue I had let his mother know just in case he mentioned it.  Bobby would join another class for the day and do work inside while his classmates were at the barbecue. \n\nShe has been sending emails complaining to myself and the principal all week about how her child should also be able to participate and it is unfair. She thinks we should make an exception since he has behavioral issues and feels we could be targeting him. I think I\u2019m being fair because he did not earn all of his good noodle stickers. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nUpdate: \n\nI had a meeting today after school with the parents and the principal. \n\nThe principal agrees it would not be fair to the other students to allow Bobby to participate. She expressed she understands the frustration but she needs to make it fair for all students and not just Bobby. \n\nThe father said he understood and thought it was a fair assessment if all the other students were able to complete the goal. \n\nThe mother argued Bobby\u2019s IEP. The principal then reminded her we follow his IEP as a courtesy but as a private school we legally do not have to follow it and she has a choice to come to this school but if she\u2019d like to unenroll Bobby then there was a waiting list of students they could contact to take his place. \n\nBobby will still be enrolled in the school and in my class if anyone is wondering. He will not be attending the barbecue.\n\nUpdate 2: \n\nBobby\u2019s mother came to the school yesterday to drop off Bobby\u2019s lunch he forgot at home. She arrived during the children\u2019s snack recess. All of the kids were playing freeze tag. A game where once you\u2019re tagged you have to freeze until someone unfreezes you. I was inside prepping art while the teachers aid was with them. \n\nBobby\u2019s mother came inside absolutely livid saying we were forcing her child to stand in one place and not let him move. We explained the game and she said then the students are cruel for not unfreezing him but unfreezing everyone else. She was making such a big scene and so loud the principal overheard (their office is down the hall).  \n\nHis mother was removed from the school grounds and we had a meeting with his father in the afternoon. The principal let him know Bobby would need to be unenrolled due to his mothers behavior. He did try to get him to stay until at least the end of the year but ultimately understood. He was also told if Bobby\u2019s mother is on the school grounds again the police department will be called immediately.",

      "content": "YTA. \n\nAs a former educator myself, I hate these kinds of public exclusionary rewards, ESPECIALLY for very young kids.  These are 1st graders.  From what you've posted,  it sounds like this was the only student excluded. There is literally no way that is going to encourage better behavior from this young child in the future. \n\nKids, especially young ones,  often act out in reaction to emotional stimuli they don't have the appropriate tools to process yet.  99% of the time,  a kid of 1st grade age who is acting out has trouble somewhere - stress/problems at home,  getting bullied, who knows.  For the same reason it's unfair to punish young kids for tardiness or attendance issues,  it's unfair to expect a kid this young to \"behave\" all the time when you have no idea what might be happening in their lives that isn't in their control. \n\nPublicly excluding one child is going to make behavior issues worse.  You're turning them into a pariah to their peers - kids can be mean,  and honestly don't need much to single someone out as \"other.\" \n\nI know you want to use some kind of reward system for the kids who are behaving the way you want,  but you're talking about 6 year olds! Something as big as a BBQ at the park should have been an all-or-nothing class goal. Singling out the one kid who is having trouble (which, again, you as the teacher will almost NEVER know the true source of) is bullying. \n\nIf these were high schoolers that would be one thing - teenagers are more mature and can be expected to have more control over their behavior - but we're talking about kids who are only SIX years old. \n\nYou need to rethink your reward system,  keeping in mind age-appropriate expectations for these children.\n\nEdit: some of your comments specify that this kid has an IEP. 100% YTA. A kid that young who already has an IEP is never going to be able to meet that level of behavioral expectation, regardless of whatever accommodations the IEP calls for. Perfection for a month! You set this kid up to fail. Hopefully not on purpose,  but that's still the outcome. Learn from this in the future.",

As a mom to a kid with ADHD, SPD, Anxiety, and Tourette\u2019s, I really appreciate your comments. \n\nMy kid already graduated high school, but I can tell you, in 1st grade our first Parent/Teacher conference was after class on the first day of school. His teacher used a green/yellow/red card system.  It was November 9 the first day he actually ended the school day on a green card. It was a Tuesday. How do I know? Because I cared and was an involved parent. Because his teacher and I were a team that both wanted him to succeed. Because it was a HUGE achievement for HIM. Because he could not be measured by the yard stick of another child. His teacher celebrated him that day! He got a trip to the office to be a special afternoon helper to the principal and secretary after school as a reward for showing responsibility. \n\nThe child HATED coloring with a passion (fine motor skill delays) and writing was challenging enough. Some days that were particularly challenging, he would get picked to take a walk in the afternoon to help wash and slice leftover fruit from lunch. The school noticed that a handful of kids would start struggling with attention and flowing directions in the afternoon, and rather than being sent to the office for discipline, they would be sent to the office for a couple slices of apples and oranges. A boost to their blood sugar and change of scenery. Then sent back to class where they were in a better state of mind to learn. Disciplinary referrals went down, mastery of skills went up, disruptions in class went down. \n\nBy the time my kid was in 8th grade, reports from the teachers were that he was the best behaved student in class. \n\nIf OP treats this child like he\u2019s the bad kid, when really he\u2019s just a kid struggling to cope in a classroom environment before he is fully able, then the kid will become the \u201cbad\u201d kid. He will see himself that way. The students will see him that way. The teachers will see him that way, and sometimes, the parents will see him that way. Do not do that to him. \n\nOP is TA and should never restrict a 6 year old kid from a field trip because they are not \u201cperfect\u201d.  Imagine if your spouse refused to take you out for an anniversary dinner because you were not a \u201cperfect\u201d husband/wife. We are humans. None are perfect.",

The logic is wildly flawed - supposedly the children are aware of the expectation of 100% perfect behaviour for the duration of the month in order to access the reward, yes?

So if a child were to not receive a sticker one day, why on earth would that child maintain their good behaviour for the rest of the month if they no longer have a reward to work towards??

They actually have far *lower* standards of accountability.\n\n**Edit to address your extremely disappointing edit:**\n\nI want you to think about the following VERY CAREFULLY as you move forward in your career as a teacher of children.\n\n> \u201cThe principal then reminded her we follow his IEP as a courtesy but as a private school we legally do not have to follow it and she has a choice to come to this school but if she\u2019d like to unenroll Bobby then there was a waiting list of students they could contact to take his place.\u201c\n\nI want you to TRULY understand what this TRANSLATES TO:\n\n\u201c*Your child has special needs. I would like to remind you that we do not think it is important to meet the same legal standards for inclusion and equity that public schools do. In other words, either keep your kid here where we punish him for being special needs, or take him somewhere else, because we don\u2019t want people like him here. We, and the other students on the waiting list, are better than him.\u201d*\n\nI want you to REALLY THINK about if this is why you got into teaching. Are you in it to help kids learn\u2026 or are you in it to be the instagram teacher with charts and BBQs (but only for the rich and smart kids pls)\n\nYou have TWO CHOICES about how to proceed now that this meeting is concluded:\n\n- you could feel validated that the principal backed you up and not worry about it anymore and let yourself believe you did nothing wrong because you didn\u2019t get in trouble\n\n- OR you could recognize that what happened in that office is discrimination, realize you had a part in creating it, and make a better effort in your classes moving forward to actually set this child up for success\n\nYou are treating a HUMAN CHILD as if they are an inconvenience rather than a person, because they are different.  Let me be clear: punishing or excluding only this child for not meeting unfair standards for behaviour is the same thing as punishing or excluding a child who needs glasses for failing vision tests. Or punishing or excluding a child in a wheelchair because they can\u2019t do the obstacle course. Being left out of something the entire class is doing? That\u2019s not a consequence, that\u2019s public shaming. And it\u2019s traumatizing. \n\nAnd it makes me (and the vast, VAST majority of people on the internet) sick to think about. Him staying enrolled in your class is heartbreaking. He SHOULD go somewhere that he is valued and treated with respect. But he shouldn\u2019t have to. \n\nReally think about that. Were you shocked by this sub\u2019s reaction? Why do you think so many people reacted that way? I think it is time to realize that you live and teach in a bubble of privilege.

When teachers fail to help them adequately and to adjust expectations, children react with minor behavioral issues. Teachers fail to be empathetic and rather than seek help to understand the kids, they end up using inadequate reward/punishment systems with behavioral goals children are already unable to attain, thus increasing even more their feeling of failure and hopelessness. And then they wonder why behaviors keep getting worse and worse until they are no longer manageable. Now, the only thing this child has learned is that no matter the efforts, it is never going to be enough and school is cruel. So why bother trying?
