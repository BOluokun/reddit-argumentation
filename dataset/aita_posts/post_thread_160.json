  "post content": "So this happened yesterday and I still feel pretty bad about it so I wanted to ask Reddit\u2019s opinion. I (25F) went with a friend to watch the new 007 movie at a pretty popular theatre. We booked our seats in advance via online, and our seats were M10 and M11, towards the back in the middle. We got there 10mins before the movie started, and saw that there was a couple (20s?MF) sitting in our seats. I asked if the seats they were sitting were  M10/M11, and they might be sitting in our seats. The guy in the couple said this was N10/N11. My friend and I were confused, so we asked the row in front of us to see what row that was. They said it was L. So if we go by the alphabet (and the row letter was also on the carpet) the couple were not sitting in their seats.\n\nI asked the couple again nicely that they might be sitting in the wrong seat, and the guy started to get really frustrated saying that \u201cthese are just seats\u201d and that they even asked a worker here and mentioned that this was N10/N11. This is where I might\u2019ve been the a-hole. My friend said let\u2019s grab a random seat, but I went outside the theatre and grabbed a worker and explained the situation. The worker came up to the row with me but mentioned that \u201cthere were still empty seats\u201d. I replied to him that people were still coming in so I didn\u2019t want to take someone else\u2019s spot if the seats the couple were sitting was actually our spot. The couple saw us bringing a worker in and the guy came up to us and started to talk bad about me in front of the worker and how I\u2019m blowing it out of proportion and said crude things about me. The worker went out and got another person (I assume the manager) to verify the seats. At this point the movie didn\u2019t start yet but people that overheard us was also saying that these are just movie seats and that I should just sit anywhere else.\n\nTurns out the couple was wrong and those were our seats. The guy started to yell that he wanted a refund because the N10/N11 seats are not in the middle (any row after M only had seats on the left and right side, and empty in the middle for accessibility reasons). He said that I ruined his \u201cf-ing birthday\u201d and I told him ok, and told the worker to give us a seat that\u2019s not taken and we\u2019ll sit somewhere else and he said no, it\u2019s too late and I ruined his birthday night. He stormed off and his girlfriend walked out and cursed at me that I ruined the guy\u2019s birthday. The movie began shortly after so we didn\u2019t cause a scene during. However, I feel bad for things to escalate so much, but I didn\u2019t know where else to sit as it could\u2019ve been reserved. Plus, it was his birthday. Should I have just let the couple have my seats? AITA?",

Then I quickly move before the company intros are over. And I make sure the seat I'm moving to doesn't involve getting by other cinema goers and blocking their view. Even then if someone turns up and I'm in their seat I'd immediately move and normally have a 'backup seat' I can move to if needed.
