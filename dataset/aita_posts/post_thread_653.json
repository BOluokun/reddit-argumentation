  "post content": "My SIL and I do not get along. We actually used to be great friends in college and I in fact met my husband through her but she... changed. She\u2019s now obsessed with being the \u201cperfect\u201d mom, sews all of her kids\u2019 clothes, feeds them all organic vegan food, homeschools, etc. All of that is fine and I really don\u2019t care what she chooses to do, but she is insanely judgmental. Constantly makes passive aggressive comments about the fact that I didn\u2019t have a natural childbirth, that my kid has been in daycare since he was 12 weeks, that I work really long hours, that we feed our son fast food (he really likes chick fil a and I see no reason why he can\u2019t have this occasionally), and so many other things. Needless to say, I generally choose not to spend time with her.\n\nMy in-laws have a lake house that is not very convenient to where we live so we don\u2019t go there often. However, my MIL requested that we all go for her bday since we are all now vaccinated and she hasn\u2019t had all of us together in over a year. My husband decided to rent a boat for one of the days so he could go fishing with my son. Of course my nieces wanted to go too and originally, we were fine with it. However, then my SIL said they weren\u2019t allowed to go without her so she had  to come too. Well, I really didn\u2019t want to spend like 8 straight hours with my SIL in the middle of a lake on a small boat so we just told her the boat couldn\u2019t accommodate that many people (although it was kind of an obvious lie). My nieces had a meltdown bc they were missing out on a fun all-day boat trip. We ended up just going without them bc my SIL would not budge. \n\nWell, it\u2019s been a few weeks now and pretty much my husband\u2019s entire family is united in their belief that we are gigantic AHs. They said we obviously lied to keep SIL off the boat and that we purposefully deprived our nieces of a fun outing. Apparently our nieces have also been asking why we don\u2019t like them anymore. I feel zero regret for excluding my SIL, but my nieces are good kids and we love them very much. Now I kind of feel like we were the AHs for making them feel like we didn\u2019t want them to come along with us. \n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not judging my SIL at all for her decision not to allow her kids to spend all day on a boat without her. While I think personally it would have been safe (2 adults familiar with boat safety, 3 kids ages 5, 8, 9), I get why she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with that. My main issue was simply that I didn\u2019t want to listen to her make jabs about my parenting and life choices all day.\n\nInfo: We didn\u2019t tell our nieces that they could come, we told them that they had to get permission from their parents and then my SIL told us no, unless she also comes along. \n\nInfo 2: I have had many (many) talks with my SIL over the years about the way she talks to me and she always apologizes, claims she doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s doing it, and tells me she will try to be more conscious. She\u2019s usually good for a few weeks at best, but then will start in again with the passive aggressive remarks. None of what she says is straight up mean, it\u2019s just a constant barrage of \u201cwell of course, I don\u2019t judge you, but I\u2019ve just read a lot about food dyes in those snacks and I\u2019m just concerned about (my son). I would never dream of giving those to (her kids).\u201d\n\nInfo 3: A lot of people have commented that it\u2019s weird/inappropriate to rent a boat that isn\u2019t intended for the whole family during a family vacation. My husband is a pretty quiet, introverted guy and spending a week straight with his (very loud and large) family is draining for him. It\u2019s normal behavior for him to do his own thing during vacations with his family. His family knows this and doesn\u2019t usually mind bc they are so used to it. As far as I know they aren\u2019t upset that he rented a boat for the day, it\u2019s bc we didn\u2019t bring our nieces along.\n\nInfo 4: For those of you suggesting that I call her out on her behavior while on the boat, or that I turn the boat around bc of her behavior, I\u2019m not going to be outright mean to her in front of her young kids. I get that being passive aggressive about not including her on the boat is not the most mature thing to do, but I was trying not to cause too much drama/conflict in front of our nieces (obviously didn\u2019t work though). They love their mom, who is actually a very good and kind mother to them. Yes, she is super controlling of their lifestyle but honestly, they\u2019ve never really known any differently. She is absolutely a judgmental nightmare to me, but I\u2019m not trying to ruin their image of her. Maybe when they\u2019re older they will pick up on her passive aggressive BS to others, but for now they\u2019re still little and think mommy is the best. I\u2019ve never confronted my SIL in front of our kids, and don\u2019t ever plan to. That being said, I definitely could have talked to her more honestly about the boat in private and seeing how upset our nieces are now, I\u2019m kind of wishing I had just sucked it up and let her go.\n\nUpdate: I showed this to my husband and we both decided that we are the AHs bc our love for our nieces is more important than the fact that my SIL is a judgmental jerk. Someone suggested that we plan a special outing with my nieces so we have decided to call my SIL, apologize for hurting our nieces, and discuss an outing for all of the kids. Thanks for the judgment all, it actually did help me reach my decision!",

Also if you told the girls that they could go this was probably a huge blow to their weekend. You shouldn\u2019t tell kids yes to things if you can\u2019t back it up, and if you have to cancel telling an obvious lie makes things 1000% worse.\n\nEdit: I am still sticking with ESH. You told your nieces to ask for permission, that implies that if their mom says yes they can go on the boat. Mom said yes, just with a qualifier you didn\u2019t like but honestly it\u2019s not that out of left field. \n\nYou then told a lie that was obviously a lie so you could get out of taking them. Yeah it sounds like this woman is annoying but I still think you did not handle this situation appropriately. At the end of the day though it\u2019s a boat and not the end of the world.",

I can't handle most meat substitutes, they cause nausea, lintels won't go down and I'm very picky when it comes to fruits and vegetables. There are very few I'm able to make myself eat. I'm generally fine. Ironically I have currently an iron deficiency causing anemia but that's not uncommon in young women. A meat-free diet would make this a bigger issue though",

I'd own my decision.\n\nI'm confused by your comment. Are you saying to make sil be the bad guy and tell her kids no or for OP to take the blame but own up on her reasoning? Honestly I'd be reluctant to make waves with a family member I see infrequently without good reason. Also for your first reasoning; it's pretty easy to pick up from tone of voice and nonverbal cues when someone is making a dig at your life style so if it happened more than once and on more than one topic, I doubt OP is reading too hard into it.",

Your perspective is completely valid, and you have every right to not spend 8 hours on a tiny boat with a big bully.\n\nIt is very unfortunate for your nieces to have such a mother, because I had a very similar problem with my cousin. She was my best friend in the family, but her mom and her older sister are both nightmares, which caused her to be excluded from things because my mom knew that her mom would insist that her older sister go with us, and we both hated having her tag along because she has some birth defects that are unclear to me but clearly cause her to act like the younger sister by a lot even though she is the older one. Her mom basically made my cousin the caretaker of her older sister. It sucked for her, but eventually she understood that it wasn't her that no one wanted to be around, it was her family that everyone hated. She didn't have a great childhood, but she also turned out okay because she had emotional support from me, my mom, and her friends. \n\nI think your SIL sounds just as painfully irritating as my aunt and her first daughter, so I think it is perfectly fair to avoid her. Also, as long as you can talk to the kids and don't exclude them ALL the time (which it doesn't sound like you do, it sounds like you hang with them enough), then you are not being an AH. \n\nAlso your in laws sound like my dad's family. its not just my aunt and her elder daughter. Its also my grandpa, my dad (my parents are divorced), my grandma a little, and all my aunt's friends. Be careful, bullies hang out with and associate with other bullies so it wouldn't be surprising if most of your in laws wont ever understand your perspective. My cousin was the exception in her family, your husband may have been the exception in his family.",
