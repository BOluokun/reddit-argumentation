(yay) come to find out though it's a pyramid scheme. It's called CutCo. I already knew about this scheme since I watch alot of videos on different schemes, but where I feel I wronged here is that I didn't hammer it into him to quit. I told him once on how they're a huge scam and how they ruin lives, but he of course didn't believe me. And I didn't feel like fighting with him about it so I just left it. I feel like I should have done more to help him quit it.. so Reddit AITA for not making my friend quit his really bad job?",

Then again I don\u2019t think your friend\u2019s is an asshole, they\u2019d only be an asshole if they actually blamed the whole thing on you",

You did exactly what was expected of you as a friend; it was his decision whether to take your advice on board or to ignore it.\n\nThe truth is, you can't force people to change their minds, sometimes they just have to learn from their mistakes the hard way. Hopefully he'll trust you next time he signs up for a job like that lol.",
