  "post content": "Last weekend, one of my friends organized a group of people to go do fall things. We rented a van and went to a few breweries/wineries. \n\nWhen we got back, we stopped at a pub to hang a bit before going home. There were about 12 of us so they seated us at a table. People ordered food and drinks. When the check came, one of the guys quickly gave his card and after signing, looked around and said okay everyone venmo me $45.\n\nThis threw me off because many people had ordered meals, sides, drinks and shots. I had ordered a diet coke (I had to drive 1.5 hours home) and shared an appetizer with my husband. I asked if we could each venmo him for what we ordered and he seemed annoyed. He sent everyone a pic of the receipt and had everyone venmo him for what they got.\n\nFor context, I'm fine splitting the bill evenly when everyone orders roughly the same thing. But also if I ever put my card down, I always ASK everyone if they want to split it evenly or not, not just assume.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being cheap and should've just split the bill evenly with everyone. I know I'm more money conscious than others so I'm wondering am I the a-hole?\n\nETA: we were expected to pay $90 (including tax and tip) for me and my husband, since my husband did have a drink and a shot in addition to what I had, our actual total we ended up paying came out to $53 (including tax and tip)",
