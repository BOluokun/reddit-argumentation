  "post content": "I (25f) haven\u2019t had a great relationship with my family since moving out, cliche bullshit, brother (30) was the golden child, I was a scapegoat, etc. etc. anyway, that made it for a rough relationship with them and have really spoken to them for 6-7 years. Well a few weeks ago I was contacted though Facebook by a woman who claimed to be pregnant with my brothers child, the problem is he is refusing to claim said child and wants nothing to do with the mother. She told me he has completely ghosted her and blocked her on everything, and apparently my mother has been quite hostile when she has stopped by to try and talk to him, and has threatened to call the police for trespassing if she comes around again. So she tells me this and asks if I\u2019d be willing to do a DNA test after the baby is born so that she can take my brother to court. I told my husband about this in front of some of our friends and one of them piped up and said I shouldn\u2019t get involved with something that has nothing to do with me and that it\u2019d be spiteful to do that to my brother, my husband kind of agreed and said I shouldn\u2019t get involved with my family again. I\u2019m honestly not sure, on one hand I don\u2019t want to have any of my family contact me after doing the test, but on the other hand I wouldn\u2019t want that to happen to me, my brother lives rent free and makes more than enough to buy a house, he should have to take responsibility for a child he helped create. \nThe baby is due in a few months so I have time to decide what I want to do, I\u2019m leaning towards doing the test, but WIBTA?\n\n\nUPDATE/EXPLANATION: The most common response and question I\u2019ve gotten to this post is why doesn\u2019t she just petition the court to get a paternity test? I live in a not so well off area and this exact scenario happens all the time here, the lawyers she\u2019d be able to get have hundreds of these cases and it will take years for her to have her day in court. She wants to have some shred of evidence to prove that my brother could be the father so that it\u2019s more likely a good lawyer will take a look at her case, or that my family will see that he is the father and come to some type of arrangement with her.\n\n\nSMALL UPDATE: My birthgiver decided to try and threaten me last night, somehow she found out that, let\u2019s call her Eve (not her real name), contacted me to ask about DNA and let\u2019s just say that BG was not happy. She sent me an anonymous message about how horrible of a child I am for even thinking about siding with Eve, and that I should be thinking about how terrible it is for my brother to \u201cbe accused\u201d like this, and how she will sue both of us for defamation, and just an all around mess of insane choppy texts that vary from accusing to guilt tripping. I am not replying but I am keeping records for court, and I\u2019ll probably get a new number, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m dealing with at the moment, I will update as things progress.\n\nSMALL UPDATE:\nSo sorry to leave everyone hanging, I\u2019ve been dealing with a bunch of bs. So the biggest update, my little niece was born in August 2022, she is absolutely beautiful, she is my niece and my brother is 100% the father. So now, unfortunately, I\u2019m dealing with a bunch of bs with my family, my birth giver is trying to say she will take Eve to court to sue for custody. I will laugh in her face on that day because we have kept all of the threatening messages and voicemails towards Eve and myself, we have also spoken to a good lawyer who told us we have nothing to worry about, we just shouldn\u2019t reply as she just keeps digging herself into a deeper hole. As for my brother, he\u2019s completely ghosted everyone and everything, my birth giver apparently sent him on a vacation after everything went down, he started getting a ton of hate from the rest of our family for being a deadbeat. I will update once the custody issue is cleared.",

If OP colludes to collect a sample without his knowledge and only the mother controls how the sample is sent and how the results are sent then two problems can occur: firstly she can control the outcome of the test. That muddies things significantly. For all we know this woman is trying to manipulate OP into creating false \u2018proof\u2019, leveraging the fact she knows OP already dislikes her brother. It may sound far fetched but there is no reason to take the chance. Secondly even if it\u2019s genuine, there\u2019s doubt over the result, he can contest the result and the court would order one anyway. Let the court sort it out fairly.\n\nThis whole issue hinges on the fact that OP already believes the woman more than her own brother, and that is skewing peoples responses - they\u2019ve already decided what the test result is and what the motivation for wanting one is. Yet it\u2019s strange that her brother and mother are going to such lengths to distance from her and even potentially getting police involved - that\u2019s pointless if she\u2019s telling the truth because she could take him to court anyway and force a test.
