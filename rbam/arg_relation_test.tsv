1	The US has a very prudish and puritanical culture. A LOT of us were raised to treat sex as a dirty shameful thing, that enjoying it makes you a bad person, and that it exists only for procreation amd mever ever pleasure. Also that doing it outside marriage means you're gonna be tortured forever. Yes, this is as traumatic as it sounds, thanks for asking.	"We didn't really ask.  Also, it's not ""prudish"" to not want to listen to someone else having sex."	Attack	Attack
2	"NTA You know, up until the whole rant and ""he had expected me to plead with him to change his mind"", I was really respecting the guy. Like, good on him for making sure the person who walked you down the aisle really mattered to you. But clearly that wasn't his intention. He clearly thinks he is owed a particular relationship with you, rather than the one you actually have. He could have taken the ""pity ask"" without question, or even taken it after you explained yourself, accepting that, while the relationship isn't what he'd like, he still clearly means something to you.Instead, he asked some questions to which he really didn't want the answer. That's his fault."	Oh yeah, it was never about caring so much about what would make me happy. It just upset and annoyed him that I didn't want him and he felt he had earned the right to be wanted and truly wanted. So he wanted me to plead with him to do it so he would feel better about things.	Support	Support

I use a classroom management app to communicate with the team I coach.

5	So I (19f) am a manager at a store and live at home with my family when my sister (18f) turned 18 she was still pretty shy and naïve so my mother encouraged her to get a job with me so I could make sure she knew how to act in a professional setting. Today I was out running errands and my parents were both working so my sister and brother (16) were going to have to ride their bikes to work. My sister left first and her bike was broken and instead of calling myself or one of her friends to ask for a ride she took my brothers bike. His bike his is prized possession he spent all his summer savings on it and has a bunch of accessories in it she didn’t ask him before he took it and when my brother realized he didn’t have a way to get to work he called off. When I got home I asked him what happened and he said our sister took his bike so about 10 minutes before the store closed I told him it might be a little funny if we drove up and took the bike and waited for her to admit she took it. He was all for it so I pulled up to the parking lot next to the store and had my brother get the bike and meet me at the gas station up the street and put the bike in my car and wait for her to either walk past us or call us. We called our mom to tell her in case she called her instead so she wouldn’t worry and our mom called us a couple minutes later to say our sister called and wanted a ride home we pulled up and the other manager was there waiting for her to get a ride my sister started crying and we had to convince her we weren’t mad at her before she would get in the car and now she’s not talking to me.

6	"My friend thinks I gave him bad advice as it cost him his lease offer. I think the landlord was being unreasonable.

**Friend:** Mid 30's M in graduate school in Germany. His program is tuition-free and his expenses are low, but he's not earning any money at the moment. He's American and was previously earning well in the U.S.

**Me:** Mid 30s F.

**The situation:** He's living in a 3-month rental mostly from being indecisive about where to live in a new city. He pays ~€1300 monthly for a small one bedroom apt. The lease ends at the end of this month (03/24). He wasn't proactive in letting his landlady know his plans (probably was undecided) so she reached out about two weeks to the close of the lease and offered an extension of 5 or 6 months at the same rate he's paying now (which is high for a longer-term lease). Friend consulted with me and I advised him to accept the 6-month extension since he's busy with school, which he did. But then she immediately came back with a caveat. She's traveling to my friend's city to ""visit a friend"" in mid-April and was planning to use the apartment for 4 nights. She asks if he can room with other people or cover part of her €400 hotel bill. She mentions she also has flight expenses. Friend is annoyed and calls me to work through the situation again. He's ready to cover 50% to get her off his back.

**The advice:** I tell him this is not a reasonable request for her to make after offering a lease extension. I advise him to negotiate but keep a friendly and agreeable tone. As my friend describes it, she is keeping the conversation informal, e.g., she's sending emojis, but she's definitely testing boundaries. I say to leverage the fact that he's providing rent continuity and that he hopes this will lighten her load on the travel bill. Friend tries to call her to discuss but she seems to prefer text, so he texts her exactly this and also adds that he's a student with no income.

**Aftermath:** Landlady responds, assuring him she will have no issue renting the space if he leaves. She seems offended. Friend regrets the move and tries to renege, saying he's willing to consider rooming with other people for those four nights. Landlady responds with ""we're not on the same wavelength"" and rescinds the lease extension offer. Friend is now out of a lease and has to move within a few days or weeks as he studies for finals. Friend is not angry with me but he's insistent that I offered bad “antagonistic” advice.

**My opinion:** I'm sad it's come to this, but I'm happy that the landlady does not get to have her cake and eat it too at his expense. Even better if she can learn from this to be reasonable with her tenants, as she will certainly have a lapse in rent that will cost her more than €400. Important to note that friend has more resources than me, and is more willing to part with relatively small amounts of money for peace of mind. Perhaps I should have accounted for this. Also should have realized friend had little leverage as his lease was ending and he'd not initiated a discussion sooner. Also, he tends to be the ""be the bigger man"" type whereas I am more confrontational. 

So, kind people of AITA, did I give my friend bad advice? Am I the asshole here?"	"Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

7	[deleted]	No the OP only said that their daughter HAD in fact worked they didn’t say the others had t 🤷‍♀️ did they handle it well NO obviously BUT I do believe they had a valid concern and the teacher was, in my opinion, trying to brush his valid concerns off as non valid and he lost his cool 🤷‍♀️	Attack	No
8	Absolutely. I am child free by choice and when I have gotten serious with men who wanted children I broke up with them. A solution is not having kids then refusing to take responsibility for them later.	"I remember when my late, alcoholic husband said he wanted kids because he was being all dreamy about the rose tinted parts, ""teaching them to play guitar"" and insert a few other things you'd see in slow motion on Hallmark commercial. I was like ""yah, that's real cute and all but you are going to have to do that with someone else. I don't want kids at all.  I especially don't want kids with an alcoholic."" He suggested compromising by ""me working a second job or something and he could just handle the bulk of the parenting. Oh, and he would def ""try to cut down"" on drinking (lmao, most addicts tend to increase use in times of stress so that would have probably been hell on earth). Thankfully he ultimately changed his mind and came to his senses after trying to start a band with a guy with a couple of kids. All it took was a couple visits at his place for practice to see what parenting actually entailed and he changed his mind and was like ""yeah, well music is my true passion and I can't dedicate my life to it if I have to stop and do all that. What a distraction!""

Glad I didn’t give in. He mixed opioids with his usual two OE 40’s one night because “hard day at work” and didn’t wake up. Now I’d be stuck with a kid I didn’t want. 

Sounds like OP actually took the parent up on the offer (minus the alcoholism). This is why you don't compromise on having a kid. You either both do want them and you have them, or the one that wants them ultimately prioritizes their s/o as being their life mate over hypothetical offspring (which means they were most likely a fence sitter), or you end things and find someone with the same goals."

11	"So, here's the thing. I have a strange sense of humor and absolutely love pranks. So, I, 23 M, recently ordered googly eyes in bulk and decided to have some fun. I put googly eyes on every family photo there is. This includes my grandparents, wedding photographs, baby photos, and even pets. When my parents, 50s, and siblings, 16 F and 18 M, saw me place those googly eyes, they all reacted differently. My mother found it funny the first time, but after five days, she was very irritated. My father could not care any less. My sister laughed out loud and took selfies with googly eyes over every photo of one's face. My brother was furious; he said I was “ruining precious memories.”

The grandmother, 80s, was the one who overreacted. She had a strange bond with family photos, and there was a frame of her parents that was especially emotional to her. She saw the googly eyes, started yelling, and asked me to remove them from the picture immediately. In my hurry to remove googly eyes from it, I knocked the portrait out of the shelf but it fell on the floor, and the glass broke, the frame was dented. She was distraught, and my entire family is furious with me now. They said the prank went too far and didn't respect the roots. I apologized to the grandmother and offered to replace the frame, but they are all still upset.

So, Reddit, AITA for placing googly eyes on all family photos and then breaking a priceless heirloom by mistake?"	YTA - not for the prank but for damaging something sentimental to your grandmother. It being a prank doesnt excuse the damage.	Attack	Attack

13	My (20F) friend asked me for help to help her move into her apartment in the next few weeks. I told her sure, and she offered to pay me. I told her I wanted $100 since I would be driving 45 mins to her and from where she lives she's only moving 4 minutes from her current place, she just doesn't have a drivers license or a car. She also is only moving clothing as she doesn't have furniture or a bed. We are certain it will only take 1 trip. After asking her for $100 I then told her I would need $120-130. She felt I was over pricing especially since it only takes $25 to put a full tank of gas and 200 miles into my car. She said I'm only driving 35 miles there and back and that her $100 was courteous and generous enough, however I feel like my time should be appreciated and compensated for. Yes I'm only taking her 4 mins from her old address to her new one but still. I'm helping her. AITA?	YTA for even charging a friend for a minor favor like this. You're looking at maybe 3 hours of work (an hour and a half of driving and an hour and a half of loading), but you think the $33 an hour that she originally agreed to is too little? Even commercial companies like U-Haul only charge $20 plus a dollar a mile for a truck. I'm surprised you're calling this person a friend after sticking it to them like that.	Attack	Attack
14	"I, 16M am the youngest of 5. I have 4 older siblings. Oldest to youngest: Sasha, Tim, Sam, Kylie. Anyway, complicated family history so I won't get into it, but basically their mum is my stepmum even though I'm the youngest.

I lived with my mum up until she died and I went to live with him. My SM doesn't like me. But my dad spoils me a bit, he was a deadbeat for over half-decade of my life so he feels guilty. Because of that I generally take the blame for my older siblings cause my dad let's me get away with murder. Like the time Sam and Kylie locked me in a shed.

Anyway, recently, Kylie is learning to drive and Sam is teaching her. They took SM's car and they scratched it a bit. Pretty small scratch but they were panicking and asked me to take the blame.

I don't think thats fair. I'm too young to drive so I may get in way worse trouble and plus it's SM's car and she already hates my guts. Early-Summer's coming up after my exams and I know she'll use this as a chance to ruin it.

Kylie is super mad at me now, Sam nt as much cause it's not a big deal (edit: cause he wasnt the one driving). Parents haven't noticed yet, but SM will soon. They say Dad'd let me get away with it, which yes. But SM wouldn't

I don't know what to do. I don't want to get the blame but dad'd be more mad at them than me. Its just SM i'm worried about. AITA?"	NTA and don't take the blame.
