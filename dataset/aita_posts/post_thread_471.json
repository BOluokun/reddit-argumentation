  "post content": "\nI am (25f) deeply connected to my childhood years and I consider them the best years of my life so far. My toys are the pride of my childhood.\n\nMy family house (owned by father) was rented out by my uncle which is okay for me as I live overseas and I am sincerely happy someone is residing currently and looking after the property. Issue being he did not provide notice and moved my belongings without my input. **EDIT** To clarify the living situation, the house is partitioned into 3 spaces within the one building, my grandma living in one, my uncle in another, and myself and mum living in the last before we moved out, and the whole house including the 3 spaces is owned by my dad. My uncle had no authority to rent out my place and if he did so at least he should have done a proper job respecting my items. Mind you I am not getting a single penny for my house being rented out. The rental happened in secret and I could no longer return to gather my stuff as I was waiting for citizenship. Property belongs to my father and he did not consent to the rental at all. We all considered our family home as our safe place left unattended we would eventually return to.\n\nIssue being.. my uncle left my childhood toys in the rented out family house **with strangers**. As a result my toys were lost overtime. His excuse ? Not enough room. I told him if one wants to make room they can. My family are hoarders they have so much trash. I said if it was your stuff you would go above and beyond to keep them safe. \n\nPeople who transferred my stuff  are my mother and uncle. At that time I was overseas and was not allowed to go back home for bureaucratic reasons. My mother assured me she did not throw anything out and could not enter our family house as strangers were residing at that time and did not want to disturb them. My uncle admitted he left my stuff under my old bed and asked the tenants if the stuff bother them. They said no. But since then many tenants have changed. \n\nI was heartbroken and kept crying hysterically looking through storage rooms, under some stairs and a seperate room. It did hurt me that my stuff were not in a single place but rather scattered here and there. I felt like I was tirelessly collecting my pieces trying to reclaim control and keep my cool at the same time. \n\n I was relieving past trauma as years ago my step mother tore apart childhood photos which included my mom. I wasn\u2019t present at that time. I found out when I last visited my family house. All my photos and even baptism pictures were placed in a little hole at the back of the house. It\u2019s not an attic. (It\u2019s legit just a hole at the back of the house that\u2019s far far up. I had to climb there like a cat). That\u2019s really bad as the moisture can severely damage my belongings. That happened years ago and again I was tirelessly collecting my pieces together. The hole where the pictures were placed is not safe at all to reach as one can easily fall and break their bones. I felt excluded from my own family. My dad did nothing to stop this. He has poor boundaries and wants to please the new wife.\n\nThis happened ages ago with my pictures  and now my toys..\n\nIt is not easy to travel to my family house as I literally have to travel 20 hours. Last time I visited the house was not rented out yet and my childhood toys were still under my bed. I wish I made room to take them with me at that time.\n\nSo AITA for trying to negotiate with my uncle to pay for my lost toys?",

I do agree that money won't \"solve\" anything as it cannot replace the memories, etc. but that doesn't mean it isn't an appropriate solution. Your uncle broke into the home OWNED BY YOUR FATHER and rented out the space without your father's permission. Anything that occurs as a result of that is his fault and responsibility. If a teenager throws a party at their parent's house without permission and several memorable keepsakes were misplaced or stolen by attendees, I have no doubt everyone would agree that the teenager should face consequences. While there is little expectation for safety with an unattended house for a long period of time, there is the expectation that your uncle would not rent out a space he has no authority to rent and make money off it. Even if it was a simple case of theft by a stranger, they would still be responsible for the monetary value of the stolen items. I'm very sorry you lost your childhood toys, I hope that there are enough of your childhood belongings remaining for you to cherish and protect. While it isn't your fault this happened, I urge you to better secure the remaining items you may have, seeing as you cannot trust some of your family.",

People who are commenting on this about how it's 'your responsibility' to make sure that your items are properly stored seem to be missing the part where the homeowner allowed you to leave your items there in storage, and then another tenant essentially illegally rented your separate unit out.

Has your dad demanded that your uncle pay him the rent he was making off of his property?\n\nI do agree with the comments about how you're not likely to actually get proper compensation for these items, though. I'm sorry about that, but sentiment doesn't come with a price tag.\n\nBTW, it seems like your mom doesn't want you to do anything about it because she helped move it, and if you can just forgive your uncle and let it go, then she doesn't have to feel guilty for her role in things. She's trying to avoid her own culpability by telling you you'd be TA to pursue this.",

They simply expected that, should no illegal actions occur regarding their father's property and the items left there, that they would remain there because the property is unattended but owned by someone they could trust. It is insane to blame someone for the illegal actions of another person who had no right or authority to enter the residence, rent it out, or allow anyone to touch OP's belongings. While it is true that OP should not expect total protection, it would be entirely reasonable to expect that their uncle would not have done the things that he did and to hold him accountable for any damages (unfortunately, only for the monetary value of the items, despite their sentimental value) that occurred as a result of his ILLEGAL ACTIONS.",
