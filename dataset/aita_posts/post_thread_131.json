I usually try and mix it up so he doesn\u2019t get tired of the same stuff. \n\n\nWell I tried experimenting with some particularly healthier things. I sliced him apples, and made special apple dip (which is admittedly not very healthy but he loves it) to go with it. Cut up pineapple, watermelon, and cantaloupe, with unhealthy syrup, strawberries, and grapes to make a fruit salad. But I guess I forgot the fork. \n\n\nAnd he must\u2019ve had a bad day - cause he let me have it when he got home. He gets upset sometimes. But not like that. \n\n\nAlthough he seemed genuinely upset. Apparently the syrup made his hands sticky and he had to use his hands cause of no fork. And he just yelled about how I was to incompetent to properly pack his lunch.\n\n\nSo I told myself I\u2019d quit waking up early to make him breakfast, pack his lunch, and kiss him goodbye. Also since I\u2019m so incompetent I  decided to just make microwaveable TV dinners from now on. I\u2019m also to \u201cforgetful\u201d so I figured I\u2019d just forget to clean up after my 50 year old husband. Who\u2019s spent the past 30 years letting me do it.\n\n\nBut i basically became someone who just laid around. And although he yelled at me and belittled me in front out family. Me holding onto it seems immature. It lasted about 2 weeks. Before he finally admitted that he takes me for granted. I\u2019m happy. But also feel kind of like an a hole since i intentionally made his life miserable.\n\n\nI\u2019m 48, and he\u2019s 50. We\u2019ve been together for 30 years, and married for 28. \n\n\n**We both work full time**\n\n\n**I\u2019d like to say that I appreciate everyone who took the time to reply to me. I Hope you guys have a great rest of your day. And thanks for not just ignoring it. It means a lot to me. So thanks.**",

Will he be more respectful towards you now? \nBecause I honestly feel that is the big issue here.\n\nThe fact you are left feeling like TA after being yelled at and belittled for standing up for yourself is very telling.",
