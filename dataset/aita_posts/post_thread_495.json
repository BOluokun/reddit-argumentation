This is more of a \u201cbro why didn\u2019t you tell me thing?\u201d And surprise because I always thought we were fairly close. \n\nSo I was going through twitter and a tweet he liked popped up. I thought the video was funny so I went to his likes to see if there was more videos. As I was scrolling through his account I noticed a bit of a pattern emerging, so out of curiosity I went to see who he followed. \n\nHe followed a lot of gay porn accounts (which again is fine) but he\u2019s always claimed to be 100% straight. I want to know if asking him if he\u2019s not is appropriate and how do I let him know I\u2019m cool with whatever he wants to do? Or do I just let this discovery go and see if he ever tells me by himself? \n\nI\u2019m also scared because what if that was meant to be liked on a separate account? I don\u2019t want him to be blindsided if someone else finds out about it because he liked it on his account where people can find him. \n\nI\u2019m feeling conflicted. If he\u2019s in the closet I don\u2019t want to force him out. I\u2019m probably horrendously overthinking this. \n\nWIBTAH if I asked him?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m getting mixed responses. Here\u2019s my worry. \n\n- Homie isn\u2019t aware that he liked the stuff on his main account. If he isn\u2019t I don\u2019t want everyone in the world knowing if he isn\u2019t ready.",

Either way, just be supportive and a good friend and things will sort themselves out. Asking can sometimes put people in uncomfortable situations (i.e. not wanting to lie to a friend but not ready to come out. Happened to me before I came out as bi). So my opinion is just to let it be for now, the answer won\u2019t change anything between you two so there\u2019s no need to rush and ask.",

If someone had asked me during that time if i was gay, i probably would have ghosted them. Not saying im proud of that fact, but i can almost guarantee thats how i would react.\n\nIf you're concerned about other people seeing what he's liked, just casually mention hey homie, i think you've been hacked as this is what i noticed. You could then add something like 'you know you're my bud no matter what' but... i dont know, just tread carefully. Everyone's different of course but... anyway, this is my advice \ud83d\ude01",
