  "post content": " I\u2019m getting married in 3 weeks, and I just had my bachelorette over Easter weekend. During a quiet moment one of my bridesmaids took me aside and told me that about three months ago she was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. Obviously I asked her what that meant for her and she started crying because she feels differently about her relationship with her mother. We met in elementary school and she\u2019s always had a learning disability, but she didn\u2019t know that there was a preventable cause. My other bridesmaids noticed her crying, and the evening ended up being about her. We skipped out on going to a bar in the limo I had hired because she was upset. I thought about it all today and ended up emailing her to tell her that she took away an important moment from my life. I feel bad about this happening to her, but even though she didn\u2019t always know it\u2019s been going on for her whole life. If this was a recent thing she found out about or it was some kind of deadly disease I would feel differently, but she was sitting on this for months before bringing it up at an event that was supposed to be special to me. You only get one bachelorette and mine was totally overshadowed. I felt really hurt that she did that, and told her that I didn\u2019t want to have her in my wedding if that\u2019s how she\u2019s going to treat me at a time where the focus was supposed to be something good in my life instead of something sad in hers. She could have waited a few more weeks until after the wedding if she wanted to have this conversation. She\u2019s still invited to the wedding but I don\u2019t want her to be a bridesmaid after this. I was just texting my cousin (my maid of honour) and she disagreed with me doing this. She said that it sucked that we didn\u2019t go to the bar, but this other friend has already paid for her dress so I should just let her stay. My fianc\u00e9 supports my choice, but I wanted another opinion. AITA?\n\nUpdate: for those wondering I had actually seen her on two occasions since her diagnosis, including getting coffee one on one a week after it happened where she could have told me. It was the fact that she waited until my event to tell me and then derailed it that had me so upset. I hadn\u2019t considered the fact that everyone pre drinking might have set her off. After reading a bunch of comments here I called her. I asked why she hadn\u2019t told me before and she said she was still trying to process when I had previously seen her. She didn\u2019t realize she was going to cry so much and distract everyone and ruin the mood. She said she felt really horrible about doing that and that she hadn\u2019t meant to ruin the evening. I apologized for acting on my own hurt feelings and asked if she\u2019d be willing to consider still being a bridesmaid. She said she really wanted to still be in the wedding. I don\u2019t have the budget to have another bachelorette party, but I realize that I was only making that loss worse by hurting an old friend in addition to losing out on an event. I was definitely attributing her behaviour to malice when it was actually bad timing. Back in high school she did a similar thing to me because she was jealous of the attention I was getting as part of a competitive choir, but she\u2019s grown up since then (we\u2019re 23 and 24 now). I overreacted, and I honestly appreciate the tough love from this sub. It made me reconsider what I was doing and probably just saved a friendship.",

It was completely understandable to be hurt and frustrated. BUT you didn't need to cut her from the wedding. That was retaliation, pure and simple. You could have called her and opened up the door to have an honest conversation about how you felt and allow her to respond, this would've shown compassion and grace. Instead you made a decisive decision because your feelings were hurt. It is your wedding, but she is also a close enough friend where you asked her to be a bridesmaid and she deserved that conversation before you decided to push her out. I would absolutely apologize to her and realize that in this case you've both been shitty to each other.",

But the lack of compassion for the friend who has found out something life-changing for her and is still processing/struggling with it - c'mon. If she didn't intend it to go this way, then she made poor decisions and needs to set better boundaries yes.

Except it got worse- My dad died 3 weeks after my wife came out. 5 weeks later, his husband passed. My entire family is in town and I didn't want or need additional stress. I literally shut completely down a couple of times- unable to make decisions when I'm usually very decisive. My wife said that for the time being, she'd keep living life as she had (in the closet, male presenting) so that it wouldn't take away from the occasion and celebration of life for them. This is not something I asked of her, but rather, she told me that was the way it was going to happen. Ultimately, her stance on this made our relationship stronger. I thought it very big of her to put my needs over her own validation. \n\nAbout a month after everyone went home, she announced it to my family- a couple of them were very unkind. I'm glad she waited because I'm really not sure how I would have reacted in person in that emotional state. I have a very short fuse (and violent, when I was younger) but have learned to temper it in normal situations, but during that time, I struggled with lashing out.\n\nHowever, your comment struck me in a weird way. My wife and I have had a stable relationship, but for that year, I was grieving her former self and our relationship.

A FAS diagnosis is seriously traumatic - it is something that was done to her by her own mother, before she was ever born, that was a preventable result of her mother\u2019s actions. And coming to terms with that is an additional layer of trauma. \n\nI think it\u2019s totally understandable that she may have had some un-dealt with trauma related to alcohol that she only discovered when it was triggered. Appropriate timing, of course not, but it may have been the first time since her diagnosis that she was around heavily drinking women.\n\nObviously even if this is the case OP is still justified in being upset that the terrible timing ruined her engagement, but it seems so heartless to cut someone who was likely facing an unknown trigger.\n\nFAS has a seriously bad reputation - it\u2019s really hard to come forward about, because it means that your own mother did this to you, and everyone who knows about FAS thinks of the stereotyped extreme - the type with the FAS facial deformities. Many diagnosed with it feel that it has to be kept secret, if they\u2019re at all able to mask it or it\u2019s mild enough to just be passed off as learning difficulties.",

Why not say that what happened at your bachelorette party hurt your feelings and why. Then tell her you don\u2019t want a repeat scene at the wedding. Ask if she believes that will be an issue. You get the idea. If she apologized it would have been fine. But you never gave her the chance to make amends.\n\nEdited: Typo",

Like, some men get douchy when they\u2019re drunk, and some women cry. It stopped around 34 for some reason. \n\nAdd in someone who recently learned that their life has been horribly and permanently affected by alcohol being surrounded by it - while probably drunk herself - and she\u2019s bound to get all up in her feelings. She may not even have intended to tell \u2014 that\u2019s very personal information, but drunk people do be like that. \n\nClear ESH. Friend picked the wrong time to have an existential crisis. But OP is punishing a friend for a bad night in 20+ years of friendship. That\u2019s crazy to me. Incidentally, someone cried at my bachelorette - my fault for not realizing that it was an emotionally fraught date for her that she was trying to power through - I drunk smoked her cigarettes while I calmed her down and then we went back to the party. I was more worried that SHE wasn\u2019t having a good time because she was my friend and I want nice things for my friend",

Big surprise, kids who\u2019s parents aren\u2019t fit parents because of addiction or dependency probably had those dependencies through the pregnancy as well\u2026). \n\nShe definitely picked a bad time, but idk how much she chose it, exactly. A FAS diagnosis is seriously traumatic - it is something that was done to her by her own mother, before she was ever born, that was a preventable result of her mother\u2019s actions. And coming to terms with that is an additional layer of trauma. And of course, the lack of social awareness etc is also classic FAS. \n\nI think it\u2019s totally understandable that she may have had some un-dealt with trauma related to alcohol that she only discovered when it was triggered. Appropriate timing, of course not, but it may have been the first time since her diagnosis that she was around heavily drinking women.\n\nObviously even if this is the case OP is still justified in being upset that the terrible timing ruined her engagement, but it seems so heartless to cut someone who was likely facing an unknown trigger.\n\nFAS has a seriously bad reputation - it\u2019s really hard to come forward about, because it means that your own mother did this to you, and everyone who knows about FAS thinks of the stereotyped extreme - the type with the FAS facial deformities. Many diagnosed with it feel that it has to be kept secret, if they\u2019re at all able to mask it or it\u2019s mild enough to just be passed off as learning difficulties.",

You can't just shut off your feelings in a case like this, and having spontaneous hard feelings doesn't make her an AH.\n\nThat being said, there's a time and a place to bring sensitive personal information, and in the middle of a friend's celebration isn't it. Surely she knew what was planned for the night? If she wasn't comfortable going to a bar or partying with you, she should've discussed this with you beforehand and opted to stay home or leave early. There was really no reason to bring this up in the middle of your bachelorette party, especially since it wasn't brand-new information. She had ample opportunity to discuss this with you literally *any other time*. So yeah, I get why you're upset, too.",
