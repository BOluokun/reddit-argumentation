  "post content": "I (22/f) are getting married in December to my fianc\u00e9 (26/m). He already has a son from a former relationship with his Ex (25/f). Tbh, she hates us and wants us out of the picture. She's the kind of person to think everyone in the world is against her and therefore she made my fianc\u00e9 up to be the bad guy (he really isn't, he's loving and caring and just wants to be in his son's life). Their relationship has been toxic from the start and since they split up (about 2 years ago) she's trying to separate them. In December we are also going to court to fight for custody because right now my fianc\u00e9 doesn't have any (he was at university back then and lived a few hours away and she tricked him into giving her sole custody for the time being but never gave him his rights back). So much for the backstory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince they are separated every gift my stepson received has been sold. She just tries to make money from it and he never gets to keep the stuff. While talking to my sister about this year's Christmas presents for our children I dropped this information and she told me to just put his name on everything (like getting it printed on a blanket f.e.). I thought about it and told my fianc\u00e8 about it. He's okay with it but told me it could be seen as an a\\*\\*hole move. I just want to do what's best for my stepson and want him to enjoy everything he gets. I also want to gift something small to her (like chocolate) just to be nice but WIBTA if I did this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm in a good and healthy relationship. I know everything there is to know about the situation but I can't share all the details because I want to respect the privacy of the people involved. It's also not part of the question. I love my fianc\u00e9 and we are in a good place. He didn't cheat with me, we met when they were already separated and he did have time to recover from the breakup. We know it seems a bit hasty to get married so soon but we want to because we love each other. There is no money involved except child support he's paying since day 1. I just want to know if I would be the a\\*\\*hole. I can't answer to all of you, but I'll try my best. I'm a bit overwhelmed right now.",

Or does she mean a pretty gift box because she 'cant afford' wrapping paper? Either way it's a stupid request as far as I'm concerned. I think your ideas are good though as they're useful and probably won't have any re-sale value (unless she manages to find someone with the same name who need/wants those things which I find rather unlikely)",

              "content": "Definitely the story my daughter's dad likes to tell all the random barely legal \"wifeys\" he has.\n\nThat said, it is also a story I watched play out legitimately with one of my coworkers about 2yrs ago. She would constantly lie to people about what was going on during her \"fighting for her son.\" All my coworkers would hype her up, cover shifts for court dates, gave her gas cards and restaurant gift cards to help out a StRuGgLiNg SiNgLe MoM. Turns out, the half assed excuse my baby daddy and all the other deadbeats tell, actually happens to some decent guys. \n\nThis so-called mom asked her sons dad to give her sole guardianship, NOT CUSTODY, before he took a couple month trip to his immigrant parents home country to visit ailing grandparents. The father was born over 15yrs after they moved here, and his entire existence was built in the American Midwest, not in the small European countryside home of his ancestors, so he knew he'd be back after the visit and the mom agreed to videochat him a few times a week so he could see his sons face. But he understood that she had a legitimate need to be able to make all the important decisions in case of emergency without him. So he agreed, with the caveat that any paperwork he was willing to sign would blatantly state the arrangement could be revoked at any time just by signing something at the court house, and was immediately terminated 90days after signed. Well, this mother saw an ill willed opportunity and took it. Knowing that he was using an international number from a company there and had started a new Facebook account, when his supposed to be short term trip was extended after his grandmother passed while he was there, knowing that saying good bye was the point of the trip but thinking they had closer to 6mo left than 1mo, she filed for full custody under the pretense that he had ghosted during the time she knew he was leaving and she had since lost any way to contact him. Basically stating to the court he had abandoned his son. She effectively convinced everyone in our area, us at work, her whole family, and the court that she knew he was leaving for 6wks and he hadn't returned. When the 90day guardianship expired, she acted completely distraught about having to file for custody. She was going to court, lying under oath about her knowledge of his whereabouts and how to contact him, and talking shit about him to everyone, all while videochatting with him multiple times a week and keeping him under the impression that things were fine. Somewhere around 2mo behind schedule, when he had buried his grandmother, and gotten grandpa moved in with family and safe, he returned to  Central Illinois to find he had no legal rights to his son. The ensuing legal shit show that went down is still talked regularly around here. He brought down hell fire upon everyone involved: the involved law firm, the judge, her family, and especially this woman. I truly don't understand how planned on this working out long term for her. He obviously could easily prove he had remained in contact the entire time and she had committed perjury. Long story short, the lawyers she worked with paid all his legal fees to reverse everything on top of a settlement, the oldtimer local judge retired early, and he now in turn has full custody while she's serving time and she'll have to work through a plan to regain any of her rights.\n\nObviously the story above is not the typical situation. But OP and baby daddy could be in the less dramatic version for sure. Giving birth to a child does not immediately instill the ability to put that child's needs above your own petty desires.  And honestly, I feel the growing popularity and commonality of deadbeat dads, some legitimately great fathers are looked down upon because its so easy for crazy bio moms to gain sympathy these days.\n\n\n\n\nHang in there OP. As someone who gives her kid's dad every opportunity to be involved and watches her baby's heart break repeatedly when he blows her off, don't give up. All kids want is to know they're loved, and to put this much thought into Xmas presents shows you love that kid.",

She is my child's mom just as much as me when it comes to parenting decisions, but when it comes to how we handle biodad, she gets input of course but I have to take lead.)\n\nI think whether OP is being niave to biodads actual level of commitment to the son or how he lost his rights originally is unrelated to this judgement. 100% possible dude didn't want actual responsibility of the son while both finishing his degree but also enjoying his last days of unbridled freedom and recklessness in university before he to legitimately had to act like a responsible adult in the real world. Also possible bio mom took advantage of his own naivety to take control before dad figured out what he wanted. Either is possible and our internet jury really can't know.\n\nNTA for marking the gifts, I figure thats the same as me labeling my child's clothes so that she comes home with the $35 jeans she arrived in and not the $3 ones on sale at Walmart. Not because cheap jeans are bad, I love clearance sales. But what I provide my child is not her other sides families property just because she's there.

You are his dad\u2019s girlfriend.\n\n2) Stepmom does not equal mom.\n\n3) he already has two parents.\n\n4) you only know your fianc\u00e9\u2019s side of the story. You acknowledge they do not get along. It takes two to tango, missy. Your fianc\u00e9 probably does have some culpability here, even if it\u2019s lesser.\n\n5) It\u2019s interesting that while he expressed to you he may have wanted custody of his child prior to meeting you, he seems to have only started working at it when you got into the picture. The timing is suspish.\n\n6) why does she dislike you? I can probably guess. (Edit: this is not to suggest you are unlikable or a bad person, just that I can see why she doesn\u2019t want to be nice to you.) You are marrying the father of her child, whom she was with only two years ago. The child is two. That means they broke up around when he was born. He went off to uni, took a break, got to have a life and career, and she had to be a single mother to an infant. Do you know what the average new mother goes through mentally and physically the first year of a child\u2019s life? And then he turns up with a new young girlfriend wanting custody? And then the new girlfriend plays mommy and tries to communicate with her about stuff that is between her and the ex? And apparently the ex shit talks her constantly to the new girlfriend.\n\nCome on, OP, put yourself in her shoes. Seriously. Why on earth would she want to play nice with you?? \n\nI\u2019m not saying your heart isn\u2019t in the right place but you are interfering with what should be between your fianc\u00e9 and his ex. That is the mother of his child. They are tied together for the rest of their lives through this little boy. You should be encouraging him to do all of this on his own and cultivate a better relationship with her, not be an intermediary. Most custody agreements won\u2019t even allow separated parents to introduce new partners to their children for a certain time period, like a year. That should tell you how uninvolved you really should be-you\u2019re not even a major player in this fight. \n\nWhether or not your fianc\u00e9 \u201cwanted\u201d to be there or \u201cmeant\u201d to be there, he apparently didn\u2019t work very hard to be there. A father, anxiety or not, should be moving heaven and earth to be with their child, not wishing on a star until he gets a girlfriend who will do all this stuff for him.\n\nI really hope you take into consideration what a good 50% of people are telling you. It\u2019s not an indictment on your relationship. It\u2019s just sound advice for the good of you and your fianc\u00e9 and the baby.\n\nEdit-\n\nMy final verdict after reading all comments is ESH .\n\nNGL, I read your other post in the helpme subreddit and I think you may be romanticizing this situation. Like the humblebragging about how your fianc\u00e9 needs you, you build his confidence, how awful his ex is, alllll the stuff you\u2019re doing for him like writing the letters for court, etc. You\u2019re \u201csuing\u201d his ex, you say. Your other post makes it sound like you\u2019re ready for some big emotional cinematic custody trial in a melodrama. Idk if it\u2019s your age or what, but that is not a realistic view of what is happening here. \n\nAlso, you say you are \u201csuing\u201d your fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex??? Idk if you\u2019re using mistaken terminology or if you actually are suing her-in which case, no *wonder* why she doesn\u2019t want to be civil with you. You *are* acting like you want to take him away from her. You can\u2019t say all that shit about his ex, accuse her of what you are accusing her of, take her to court, blame her for allll the custody problems, and expect her to not think you want to take him away from her! If he called a government agency (as you said in your comment) to get custody from her, you actually put her in real danger of losing her child! \n\nLike she knows what you are saying about her if you are suing her and reporting her-it\u2019s on the record. Think about that for like a minute in your brain. If someone was doing this to you, would you want to play happy families with this person??? \n\nNtm, do not give a present to your fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex. It is not generous. Do not give chocolates to someone you are suing, ffs. It doesn\u2019t make you look like the bigger person. It\u2019s an action designed to make you look like you are playing nice and she is not. That gift would play off like a trap, if it were given to me in that situation.\n\nThere is also zero proof she is selling his possessions for profit. The ex buys her child toys, you said in another comment. You actually passive aggressively judged her for buying her child gifts in that comment. All you know is that they \u201cdisappear.\u201d Btw, one wonders why your ex only has 2 hours a week with his kid? Like that\u2019s just his shitty luck? \n\nI also find it interesting that your fianc\u00e9 gets a pass for being young and dumb when it came to \u201caccidentally\u201d giving up custody but his ex is actually *a year younger than he is* and she does not get any passes from you for being young-your fianc\u00e9 was \u201cmanipulated\u201d because he was young but you think his ex was able to\nManipulate him even though she was younger than he was? Give me the mental gymnastics on that one. \n\nTLDR: Your fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex might suck (because we don\u2019t know the whole story,) your fianc\u00e9\u2019s sucks (because wifing up a 22-year-old and weaponizing her against his ex instead of being a dad and doing the legwork, and acting like he was tricked, is sucky behavior) and you suck for not recognizing that you are overstepping this way.",
