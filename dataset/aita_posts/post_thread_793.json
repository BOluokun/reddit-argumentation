  "post content": "Hiya Reddit! I made an account for the sole purpose of asking this so here we go!\n\nI rent an apartment with 3 other people. They\u2019re awesome and I have no qualms living with them except for this one thing.\n\nI have a few guinea pigs in my room that are my beloved pets. They have a super cool custom enclosure that I designed myself. My roomies are cool with the piggies... a little too cool with them, actually!\n\nMy roommates had a bad habit of taking my guinea pigs out without permission. Sometimes I would come into my room to find one of my roomies hanging out with the pigs. Which is all fine and dandy, but it kinda bothered me that they didn\u2019t ask me first. They would also take them out when I wasn\u2019t home home or take them out to show guests.\n\nI had no problem with my roommates wanting to interact with my pigs, but I wanted them to ask me first. I told them this and they didn\u2019t really listen, and continued to play with my piggies without asking me. I asked them several more times to please not take the pigs out without asking or letting me know, especially when I wasn\u2019t home. Didn\u2019t work.\n\nI decided to put my foot down. I now have a lock on my bedroom door and don\u2019t let my roomies interact with my guinea pigs anymore. They started asking me politely if they could see them/started asking permission, but imo too little too late. I have effectively banned my roommates from seeing the guinea pigs.\n\nMy roommates are pissed and this has caused a huge rift between us. They are arguing that they \u201cshare\u201d their pets (which is true \u2014 I frequently hang out with the cats in the household), and that they have a bond with my guinea pigs. They say it is unfair of me to ban them since 1) they now love the piggies and 2) they don\u2019t ban me from playing with their pets.\n\nI understand that my piggies are lovable but I had to put my foot down! I gave them the chance to just ask me and they didn\u2019t respect that. \n\nMy friend group has been calling me a jerk, saying I\u2019m being rude and creating unnecessary drama, and they are siding with my roommates.\n\nIn retaliation, I am now banned from interacting with the cats in the house which sucks but whatever. \n\nMy roomies and friends say I\u2019m a grade A asshole and should lift the pig ban so that the house isn\u2019t a tense dramafest but I\u2019m not budging. It\u2019s created such a horrible atmosphere in the apartment that being home sucks.\n\nAITA, Reddit?",
