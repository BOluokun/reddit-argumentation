  "post content": "Gonna keep this one brief.\n\nMe, I am a College Student, so I had a way of signing up for Peacock Premium for a reduced rate. I originally got it for the FNAF movie, but I have branched out. They also have La Brea, which is a mom and I show. Plus I have engaged in some of my guilty pleasures. \\[Trolls movie series\\]. That said, since FNAF holds a special place in my heart, the PFP I set for myself is Freddy Fazbear himself.\n\nEither way, this is not about that. You might be wondering why my Aunt has my Peacock Account. The answer is my Uncle.\n\nMy Dad, my Dad's Fiance \\[Maria\\], and I went to go visit my Grandparents, and turns out my Uncle Jerry was visiting from out of state. We visited on football night, so my grandfather, my dad, and Uncle Jerry were trying to watch the game. Bad news: whatever my Grandpa uses to get his channels on his TV failed.\n\nUncle Jerry said we could use Peacock to watch it, but since they don't have an account they'd need to pay for it. This is where I came in. I signed in on his ipad and they watched it a bit on there, but then they wanted to scale up so I signed in on my Grandparents' Firestick. Simple as that. They enjoyed the game and then soon we left for home.\n\nA few days pass and I don't hear anything, but then I get a text from my Aunt Melinda \\[Jerry's Wife\\] saying \"You need to change the picture on your peacock account. It's too scary for me and the kids.\"\n\nUncle Jerry has two sons, and they're 10 and 7 respectively. They're also very much of the Christian Faith, so I bring that up because their household is not conducive to horror. However, Freddy holds a dear place in my heart for many reasons that I won't outline here. \n\nI told Aunt Melinda that I didn't want to and she said that I still need to. I then told her \"If you don't want to see Freddy every time you open Peacock, get your own account.\" and stopped responding. Aunt Melinda isn't a particularly vindictive person, so I think that's why she didn't respond directly to me after that.\n\nLater on, I got a call from Dad asking what happened, and I had to explain. He wasn't *mad* per se, but wasn't exactly proud.\n\nHere's everyone's position:\n\nAunt Melinda: Wants me to apologize and change my profile pic.\n\nUncle Jerry: Says I should consider doing it for Aunt Melinda and the boys.\n\nDad: Says that I have a point and that it's my prerogative, but says there will be an impact.\n\nMaria: Says that since I'm the one paying for the account, I have the final say. \n\nMom: Told me I wasn't in the wrong at all and I should change my password and sign out of all devices that aren't mine.\n\nI am mentally at a stalemate personally. Should I give this up? Should I just change it? Think it'll blow over?\n\nReddit: Am I the A-hole?",

But if your approach is to just let things blow over,  you're going to be waiting on the wind a lot of your life, and often when you are doing favors.

You are putting your account at risk for people who are using the account beyond your intentions and trying to control it.   I think your mom is right.   Your dad is worried about the social cost of whatever you do,  but the fact is,  you're going to bear a social cost no matter what you do here.
