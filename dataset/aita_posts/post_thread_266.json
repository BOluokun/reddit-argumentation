  "post content": "\n\nMy son (23) and his wife just had a baby boy, Everyone is overjoyed and excited but there have some issues that has risen recently.\n\n\nWhen my DIL was pregnant, I suggested that I host a welcoming party for my grandson right after she get discharged from the hospital. I've made arrangements and even emptied a room for them to stay but for some reason, she was against it and said she'd rather spend the first few weeks at home with her newborn. not only that but she said no to the welcoming party. My husband and I talked to my son and he said \"we'll see\".\n\n\nBut just a couple a days ago, We found out that my daughter in law had given birth 2 weeks ago and no one knew about it. My nephew told me and I immediately called my son, he confirmed it. he and his wife lied then hid the date of birth from the family. I told him this was not acceptable, lying just because they didn't want a welcoming party and love and support being given from family. I told him I was disappointed because for one...he ruined our welcoming for our grandbaby and also, I invited family members and they're all rightfully disappointed as well. He said it was his last resort after I kept pushing and made his wife uncomfortable but that was not appreciated because.. we were just trying to celebrate the new family member in a proper manner. We had an argument and he ended the call upon saying I ruined his joy for his newborn. My husband started texting him since he stopped replying to our phonecalls and now is threatening to block my nephew for tattling but I think that my nephew was decent enough to inform the family. otherwise God knows how long my son and his wife were going to hide their son just to keep us at arms length. We've always been kind and welcoming to my daughter in law and ger family, I don't why she would do this and disrespect the family like that.\n\non the other hand, some family members see it as a justified action because we insisted on the party.\n\nPs: Some folks, I'd appreciate it if you leave my nephew (m24) out of this conflict because he's not part of it.",

Imagine being exhausted, being dragged through a hedge backwards, gaining weight, having no more than a few hours of sleep at a time, having a new little creature pull on your nipples every few hours, having bleeding nipples, having tears/stitches in your private areas, feeling depressed, having low self esteem, not feeling like you have enough energy to bathe let alone wash your hair, put on real clothes or do your makeup. **DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A PARTY?**\n\n~ Imagine all those things and think, **DO YOU WANT TO ACCEPT GUESTS?** It doesn\u2019t matter if your partner is going to do all the work, it doesn\u2019t matter if they are coming to help, it\u2019s still possible to feel embarrassed about the way you look, the way you smell, the way your house looks, feeling like (or actually) shitting your pants. DO YOU WANT AN AUDIENCE?? It\u2019s demoralizing enough doing this with a nurse, doctor, or partner around. WOULD YOU WANT TO PUT ON A BRAVE FACE AND PRETEND TO BE HAPPY ABOUT GUESTS OR A PARTY? What on earth is wrong with people? \n\n~ No, it\u2019s not a slight to you if the mother has had her sister, or her mother, or other relatives around to help. It\u2019s not a slight to you that she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable sitting there with her boobs or ass hanging out in front of you. Some people don\u2019t feel comfortable enough getting undressed at the doctor. Everyone has their issues. MY MOM HAS CLEANED MY ASS. MY SISTER HAS CLEANED MY VOMIT. Have you done those things? Would you want someone else doing those things? My cousin has looked at the blood clots on my period pad to confirm I wasn\u2019t in fact dying. Would I show any of these things to my mother in law? As much as I love her, no! I wouldn\u2019t even want my dad there, for gods sake. \n\n~ (Some) people make allowances for pregnancy hormones. Some people make allowances for depression. This is everything piled into one with surging hormones and emotions. No, your DIL is not the asshole when she snaps at you after you keep pushing a goddamn germ party on her new born even without a pandemic. \n\n~ For gods sake OP, you\u2019ve had kids! Don\u2019t you remember what it was like? And even if you bounced back up and were superwoman can\u2019t you concede that everyone handles emotional and physical stress differently?! \n\nIs it the pandemic? Do people not give a crap anymore? **Leave all these poor new mothers alone!!** It\u2019s not your baby! You\u2019ll get to spend time with them when the mother is ready! You\u2019re not being secretly cut out! For gods sake I don\u2019t have children but it\u2019s not bloody rocket science. \n\n**In case it wasn\u2019t clear, OP, YTA.**\n\n~\n~\n\n*Edit: Thanks for the support from everyone! I don\u2019t have kids but my sister does, and she had a traumatic pregnancy both times. She struggled with hyperemesis gravidarum both times, lost weight, could barely eat a thing. Then when she went into labour she got an infection from the finger induction thingie and vomited all the way through her first birth. She was alternating between throwing up and pushing. She reacted really badly to the epidural and cried between bouts of laughing gas. I was with her right until the baby was coming out, as she was only allowed two people (my mom and her partner). The entire time, her MIL was trying to push her way in with a camera. My sister has a photo immediately after birth with my (ex) brother in law, massive smile and thumbs up, while she looks utterly spent. She hates that photo. After birth she was exhausted and I had to fight my mom down while my sister fought her MIL down from being too interfering. They forced her to come to a party a few months after, which my sister cried/begged me to go to with her for moral support, her MIL gave baby the wrong formula (\u201cthis one\u2019s fine, I had it in my kitchen!\u201d Since when?! Your eldest is in his 20s!) and sat and listened to the elderly relatives complaining about \u201ckids these days\u201d not letting them help when they know best. I\u2019ve had to sit my mom down so many times and say, what\u2019s right for you is great, but it\u2019s not necessarily right for others, and that\u2019s ok too. It doesn\u2019t make them wrong. My sister is far too kind and sweet and would give up every piece of her soul to avoid making someone feel bad. She keeps her feelings inside until she is exhausted, barely hanging on and has a full blown panic attack on the highway. I love my sister and can\u2019t stand her being pushed around. She\u2019s amazing. And I need to do a better job in being a better sister, but I would yell some entitled MIL out of the building for her. (I was going to say something meaner but I\u2019m trying to remain civil.) Anyway, if there are any exhausted mothers out there who can\u2019t bear to face saying no to their intruders, I\u2019m your woman.*",

The son and his wife probably are sleep deprived from taking care of a new baby and have to work out a new routine. \n\nPlus, if it's their first child they're dealing with even more stress. They are getting used to being parents, have to find their own rhythm, bond with their baby and enjoy their baby and each other. \n\nI get that OP wants to see her grandchild, if she hadn't pushed that hard, she probably would have been invited the day of the birth or the next day just to see the baby. \n\nOP, do better. You have children of your own, you know this. Is it really that hard to understand? \n\nYTA. You are selfish and you don't care about your son or DIL or their space. It's their family. They're adults and responsible for a child now. They can make their own decisions. Also, common sense is a great thing, try to use it.",

Your family has no say if a party for a newborn should happen the parents of the newborn have the right to want one or not.
