  "post content": "My daughter and I were recently on vacation. We spent the day in an area that\u2019s known to have a lot of rich/famous people and towards the end of the day we saw one of my daughter\u2019s favorite celebrities (we\u2019ll call her A) walking out of a store. \n\nMy daughter ran to the store but when she got near A, she was stopped by A\u2019s security. They said that A\u2019s there with her daughter for her daughter\u2019s birthday and wants to focus on her daughter. \n\nMy daughter was very upset because she\u2019s been a fan of A for a very long time so she tried again for a picture but was turned away. \n\nMy daughter was crushed so later that night I made a post talking about my experience with A. How she wouldn\u2019t let anyone go near her and her daughter, the fact that her security was rude, and her not being willing to stop for a couple seconds for a picture. I understand it\u2019s her daughter\u2019s birthday but a 1 minute interaction with a fan isn\u2019t going to ruin her day and if it does, that girl needs to learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her. \n\nThe post ended up getting a lot of attention and a lot of people actually said my daughter and I were being entitled for expecting A to interrupt her daughter\u2019s birthday for everyone that wants a picture. \n\nMy husband also saw the post and said he couldn\u2019t believe that I would bash her for trying to spend the day with her daughter. I\u2019m not trying to bash her for spending the day with her daughter but she wouldn\u2019t be where she is without her fans so I think she at least owes it to them to take a picture. \n\nAITA for making the post about A",

That's not what would happen.\n\nFirst of all, she'd be telling her daughter that even during the celebration of the daughter's birthday, a random other girl neither of them has ever met *is more important to her than her own daughter.* Her daughter probably misses out on a lot of time with her mom, because of how heavily her mom is scheduled. Expecting to be able to interrupt the daughter's birthday on demand so your daughter can get a picture, is unbelievably rude and entitled, and reducing both A and her daughter from the status of human beings to mere props for your enjoyment. \n\nSecond--once A did it for your daughter, *people would notice,* and they'd be swamped by other kids each wanting \"just one picture.\"\n\n**The only way they can have their private birthday celebration is to Just Say No to every entitled mom and her golden child.

I've also gone to Sundance Film Festival in years past, so I've had ample opportunity to observe some famous names.\n\nLike, these are real people. If you see them in public and they're obviously busy, think twice about interrupting. (Would YOU like strangers constantly butting into your time with family/friends?) If you DO decide to approach, 1) be polite--don't push your way between people and 2) if they say thanks but no thanks, please leave me alone, RESPECT THAT ANSWER. \n\nIn the end, they owe you NOTHING.

I think in general, if you're harrassing any celebrity when they're doing *anything* with their children, you should expect that there is a decent chance they're going to be annoyed with you for not allowing them basic privacy and respect, probably depending on how many others have already harrassed them, and how important the outing is.\n\nIf this post of OPs has gained any large amount of traction, they owe A a public apology, imo.  \n\n\nETA: Would have been a grea opportunity to explain respect, privacy, and boundaries to daughter, with regard to celebrities she likes, sure, but also in the grander scheme.",

It was neat to spot him, and I gave him a nod and a smile, he returned it.  However, as he was probably wolfing his lunch down so that he could go back to work, he got interrupted by at least three groups of people requesting autographs.  He was nice and gave them what they were looking for, but c'mon! He has every right to enjoy his lunch in the cafe like everyone else w/o being approached by strangers.  Had he decided to attend an expo, sure, he should expect fans swarming around him.  But eating his lunch on a workday?  Really?  I know there are no rules written about what to do here, but I would think common courtesy is to let the celebrity do what they want to do privately.",

(Not to mention most celebs try to keep their kids out of the limelight; some outright refuse to tell their kids they're famous...A's daughter might not realize A is famous and OP and her daughter just came at her and her mom out in public and it was probably frightening tbh)\n\nBut that's just that particular action.\n\nYou also went on social media to attack a celebrity who literally does not give a rats ass about you so you could feel superior and justified in your nonsense. Again, showing your daughter exactly how NOT to act.\n\nHighly suggest you do some growing up before you end up teaching your daughter all the wrong ways to be.",
