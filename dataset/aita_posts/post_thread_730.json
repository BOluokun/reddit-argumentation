  "post content": "(Sorry for formatting, I\u2019m on the phone)\nI (F16) live in Europe, and recently we\u2019ve been getting snow where I live. Currently, I\u2019m with my dad (45) and little brother (14) in a beach house (we are able to do so because of distance learning and my dad WFH), and when we woke up this morning, there were snow! We were so excited about it and made a deal to go out and play after school/work. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal tho; around 11:15am the neighbours kids were out playing with the snow they had on their ground. After 11:45am ish I couldnt see them, and they probably went inside again. After school, we went out to play in the snow and discovered a snowman on the neighbours ground... made with our snow. We didnt have much snow because they had taken quite a lot of ours. \nWe had the snow on the roof, which was low, so we could reach maybe 30-40 cm up. That was it. It was a very quick snowball fight and we managed to build a snowman the size of 30 cm and VERY thin. \nWe havent had any contact with the neighbours and didnt want to interrupt their vacation. But when we went out and grapped some snow from the public playground, they were there and reprimanded me and my brother for taking it all. I asked them where they got enough snow to build their snowman, since our snow had suddenly dissapeared. The mother looked at her kids and scolded them, but didnt apologize to us. I didnt want her kids to feel bad, i just wanted an apology or at least some snow to play with my brother. \nAITA here?\n\nEDIT: they went in to our property to take it. We have a little porch thing and some chairs with lots of snow, and they took it from there too. I do understand that I don\u2019t own the snow, and I just suck it up that I can\u2019t play with my brother in the snow, but I wanted an apology for going onto our property while we were in our rooms working/in school, which I made clear to the mother.\n\nEDIT 2: bad idea to call the kids, these people were about the same age as me and my brother, i would guess 13 at youngest and 16 at oldest.",

So if I'm shoveling snow or financially responsible for someone who gets hurt in snow on my property - you can believe it's my snow.",
