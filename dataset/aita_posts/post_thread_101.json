  "post content": "I [35m] am married to a woman named Jess [26f]. We dated for two years before marriage and have been married for one year now.\n\nMost of my family has passed away, but I have (or rather had) one aunt from my mother's side. My aunt Jill took an active role in raising me, making sure I was fed and clothed when my mother was unable or unwilling, which was often. We kept in touch, but living across the country from her, she and Jess never met. \n\nYesterday morning I got the news that my aunt Jill had suddenly passed away. I was in shock because she was still young and her life was taken prematurely in an accident. I immediately told Jess. Jess was sympathetic at first, but I told her that I needed a while to be in my room.\n\nI went to my room, where I kind of just mindlessly spaced out browsing through a news site. At some point Jess knocked on my door and told me that I needed to talk about it, to which I responded I appreciated the sentiment, but I really just needed to be alone. Jess reacted harshly to this, saying I was an \"emotional black hole.\" Then she slammed my door shut and literally stomped away.\n\nFor the next two hours, every 10-15 minutes or so, Jess would open my door abruptly and half shout asking if I was ready to \"be an adult.\" I grew increasingly impatient until I just stood up and went out for a walk. When I got back home about an hour later, the chain was locked on our front door (which we never use), and I repeatedly knocked/pushed the doorbell until Jess said that she'd only let me in if I agreed to talk about what happened. I said no, so Jess walked away. Eventually she unlocked it because I kept pounding on the door and she didn't want me \"embarrassing her in front of the neighbors.\" \n\nJess is furious at me now, saying that I'm not really grieving because I'm online. She said that I needed to let her in on my feelings, but I responded that it's hard to let her in on my feelings when she just refused to let me into our house. That set her off even more.\n\nAm I being a mega asshole here?",

Grief is one of the worst things we go through in our lives, and the most important thing is to let the grieving person take the lead. Gentle nudges are okay *only if* the person has been indulging in dangerous coping mechanisms for an extended period of time. Even then, you approach that delicately to ensure you don't do more harm than good. Needing space is not something that needs a nudge, let alone correction. \n\nOP's wife is not worried about him, she's either delusional or intentionally hiding her abuse behind \"worry\" to continue it as long as possible. But this isn't worry. This is contempt. She's seething because he's not *obeying* her. She thinks she's entitled to dictate how he processes this and *needs* to be in control. He's having big emotions that don't revolve around her and instead of seeing him as a person, she sees this as an attack on her that she can't abide. So she demands he hands over the reigns to his grief, and punishes him for not complying. She insulted and belittled him, repeatedly steamrolled perfectly reasonable boundaries, and refused to let him in his own house unless he did as he was told. She wants to make it so painful to make his own decisions that he capitulates. \n\nHopefully OP will recognize that the unwarranted torment she's inflicting on him isn't the result of his failure to obey, but the calculated *choices* of an abusive, unhinged, dangerous woman who would rather torture a broken man she claims to love than show an ounce of compassion.
