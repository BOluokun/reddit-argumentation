  "post content": "So I (F35) have been with my fianc\u00e9 (M41) for quite a while now, more than 6 years. \n\nWe both come with some emotional baggage. I am an anxious person and I am still dealing with some trauma. He had an abusive family member and spent a lot of his youth very poor. Still, over the years, we have worked on our issues and our relationship has become stronger for it. I have done my best to learn some coping skills from free resources on the Internet to manage better. However, my fianc\u00e9 acknowledges that his past messed him up but is against any sort of professional help. Even talking to me was hard at first. I am saying this because while therapy is available in my country, it's still taboo, you're considered \"crazy\" if you go to therapy. I'm no professional so I mess up and I think I made things worse here, so I am wondering if I am the AH.\n\nTonight was date night. I went out to walk our dog and he set out to clean the bathroom and get ready. I got home and as soon as I entered, I heard this horrible keening from the bathroom. It was my fianc\u00e9 crying. I called for him and all I heard was more sobbing. I went there to see what was up and I found him standing next to the shower, crying his eyes out, various tools strewn across the bathroom floor. He was holding his hands out like they were contaminated and they really were covered in some foul-smelling substance.\n\nI tried to do my best to calm him down enough to learn what happened. Between sobs, he told me how he went to take a shower but realized that there was an issue with the shower handle for the cold water tap. So he tried to disassemble it and fix it. He used a screwdriver, then pliers, one thing led to another, and he ended up *using a hammer to try and put a bolt back in*. He missed and managed to make several holes in the tiles on the wall. So he panicked and tried to fill the holes with silicone caulk, didn't use any gloves, and got it all over his hands and most of his tools. This sent him into the state in which I found him \u2013 alone, crying and wailing about how he ruins everything.\n\nI didn't blame him or get mad. I cleaned his hands with acetone and we cleaned the tools and the bath. There are holes in the wall and we need to use pliers to turn the cold water tap but I am honestly worried about him, not the wall. This isn't the first time he's tried to fix things, failed, made it worse, then got upset. So I sat him down to talk and suggested that there is a deeper issue here and that he needs to maybe talk to a professional about it (and actually learn how to fix the things he wants to fix instead of just doing stuff). I reminded him that if I had the same approach to cooking, we wouldn't have nice meals. I keep telling him that it's a pattern and that he needs help. This has distressed him even more and now he's gone to bed early, sad and blaming himself. So, AITA?",
