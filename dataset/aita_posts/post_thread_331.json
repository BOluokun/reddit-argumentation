  "post content": "I(24F) have been dating Jay(28M) for four months. He is handsome, smart, funny, well-educated, has an awesome job, and is a sweetheart. Sunday he had a whole day planned for us. We were going to walk a nature trail and then go back to his place for dinner he was making. I was so excited because it was going to be the first time I'd be at his house. Since we were hiking he said I could bring my dog Shelby with us.\n\nHe made us a roast and some vegetables for dinner. I finished my plate before Jay did and took it to the kitchen. There was still about half the roast left and it was close to Shelby's dinner time so I took half of the half of roast and some still raw vegetables from the fridge to put on a plate for Shelby. I was carrying the plate to the back door with Shelby to feed her outside and Jay asked me what I was doing. I told him feeding Shelby.\n\nJay said something like \"Well that's not dog food.\" Jay knows I mainly feed Shelby a raw diet. I opened the door to put the plate down for Shelby and Jay got up, took the plate away from her, went to the kitchen and came back with it wrapped up in tinfoil and told me to leave. His excuse was that he made dinner for me and him, not me, him, and my dog and that I should've asked before I helped myself since he would've used his leftovers. I did leave but not before telling him that he made that meal for us so I could do with some of it as I pleased and he knew damn well how I feed Shelby. I tried talking to my friend about it later that night but she said Jay was right to be upset but this friend has never really approved of how I treat my own dog so I feel like she was probably a bit biased and the wrong person to ask.\n\nAITA for just feeding my dog like I normally would?\n\nClarification: She does NOT get restaurant food daily, I eat out maybe 4 times a month. If what I eat is dog safe or the restaurant makes food for dogs on request, THEN I bring some home for her. Shelby's daily meals are a bit of brown rice, raw vegetables, and ground chicken hearts and beef livers. The hearts and livers are boiled just enough to kill bacteria and that is all with the approval of Shelby's vet. I asked Jay how he prepared the roast so I could know if it was safe to give her. That's also why I got her fresh, unused vegetables from the fridge.\n\nUpdate: I accept that Im the AH for what I said and did to Jay. Some of these responses were harsh but I see now how and why I was entitled. Thanks to people that responded to the actual issue. Others going on about her diet, thanks for the concern? but I came here to ask about Jay. Not get into a debate about dog foods. Shelby's been on her diet for 6 years and is a healthy and active puppo, that's all I and my vet need to know. As for Jay, I apologized to him and he did accept my apology but he broke it off. He said it was the last straw for him over me doing things without asking first. He has talked to me about taking things off his plate or his drink without asking before. I've tried to do better but keep slipping up. I didn't realize I was that bad about it so I'm going to work on myself for the next guy. For people that said not going to his place for 4 months was a red flag, that was my decision that he respected. I don't want to go to someone's house or them know where I live the first few months of dating and getting to know each other.",

Not only that, but you did so knowing it would upset your (now ex\u2013) boyfriend. You should have brought dog food to feed Shelby. You should not have fed Shelby with people food, and you should particularly not have fed your dog with the special dinner your (now ex\u2013) boyfriend prepared for you. It is wholly irrelevant that \"Jay knows \\[you\\] mainly feed Shelby a raw diet.\"\n\nEDIT: Also, the title of your post is misleading. Table scraps are what's leftover on your plate after you finish eating. They are not a quarter of the roast your boyfriend prepared.",

Treats, literal laundry baskets full of toys, multiple beds, with their own blankets, expensive dog food, treats, bits of my own food, supplements, enrichment toys, big ass yard they can do whatever they want it, Barkbox, regular walks to different places so they don't get bored, you name it they probably have it.\n\nBut I would NEVER give them 1/4 of roast + vegetables out of a host's fridge without permission. NEVER. Especially with inflation pushing meat prices up significantly!\n\nThis also begs the question, did OP not plan ahead for her dogs dinner? Anytime I plan to take my dogs somewhere that *might* interfere with their meal times, I bring some kibble just in case. What if the bf had made a lasagna instead? Dog just gonna go hungry or what?",
