  "post content": "This is messy. I40m have been married to my wife Cindy off and on. We had a child together who is now 17. We had a rocky part in our marriage and split for a few years, where I met a woman Stacy. We were together for a while, having twins together, ages 12. Stacy and I split up, bc she ended up being unfaithful. 2 years later I had reconciled with Cindy, we got my twins every weekend due to our work schedules.\n\nThis past weekend my oldest daughter went into early labor. It was also my weekend with my twins. \nI had told Stacy on the way to the hospital that I would not be able to have them this weekend due to this. I had put my phone on silent and away, due to a lot going on. When I returned to my phone I had abunch of text from Stacy saying how I needed to go home and be with my twins, and how Cindy could handle this situation. I told her absolutely not, that I wasn\u2019t missing the birth of my grandchild. \n\nShe then responded angrily saying how I was picking my oldest daughter over my youngest and how wrong that was since they can only see me on the weekends anyways. I tried texting and calling multiple times throughout the weekend, getting no responses. AITA?",

Labour can happen unexpectedly and scupper even the most well laid plans, what was OP supposed to do exactly, have a babysitter on retainer every weekend for the duration of his eldest daughters pregnancy on the off chance that she gave birth at an unexpected time? That\u2019s just not realistic.\n\nShit happens sometimes. A medical emergency popping up and inconveniencing his ex\u2019s plans is annoying for her I\u2019m sure, but this isn\u2019t like he got a two for one coupon on thick crust pizza and decided to ditch the kids for a night in alone, his eldest daughter who is still a minor went into labour. \n\nYeah turning his phone on silent was unwise, but not everyone has perfect clarity and purpose during emergencies- his number one priority was to be with his underage daughter going through quite possibly the most potentially dangerous and major event of her life. His twelve year old kids will be fine, it\u2019s one messed up weekend because of an emergency, not parental neglect.\n\nBut also with coparenting situations\u2026 the other parent *is* the emergency plan. His daughters staying with their mom for two more days that week means they are safe and sound, they weren\u2019t left on a dirt road somewhere. Maybe Stacy\u2019s weekend plans got messed up but I\u2019m sorry, her minor inconvenience is a small issue compared to OP\u2019s 17 year old child giving birth. Stacy and the girls will be just fine, it\u2019s a major overreaction to say he\u2019s an asshole for rightly prioritising the health and safety of his eldest daughter in a one off major emergency.",
