  "post content": "My 24 f bridsemaid / cousin Ella 26 f is to be in my wedding party in June. \nThe ongoing issue is that my wedding has a blue and green peacock theme and guests have been asked to follow this colour scheme with their clothes. \nHair wasn't originally included at all in the colour scheme but my cousin Ella has natural bright ginger hair.\n\nI would never ask someone to permemnantly change their hair for my wedding,  I know that would be bonkers so I suggested some temporary hair dye, but Ella argued that she has been growing her hair for 6 years and doesn't want to risk the colour not washing out. \nI thought this was ridiculous because it literally says washes out in like 14 washes.\nBut Ella says because her hair is completely natural colour it might take strongly to her hair. \n\nSo I gave up on that avenue and suggested a wig, it is 1 day 1 single day and there are some amazing wigs these days,  I had a look on Instagram and you wouldn't even be able to tell. \nBut she said she would feel self conscious and weird wearing a wig and that because her hair is butt length that it might sit weird on her head.\nSo she won't dye it,  and won't cover it up. \nI really don't want to come across as a bridezilla but butt length flaming red hair will destroy the wedding photos,  and ruin the colour scheme completely. \n\nIm at a loss, I can't cut her from the wedding because my mom would murder me but I can't have freaking Merida ruining the photos, AITA for asking this of her for just 1 single day?\n\ntl;dr   bridesmaid has flaming red hair and refusing to hide it for one single day for my wedding that has a colour scheme it will clash with aita\n\nEDIT: Ella has dropped out of the wedding because we couldn't reach a compromise so it doesn't matter anymore. \nI now have to deal with my mom and aunt chewing me out over it all.\n\nEDIT: OK I get it jesus iata please leave it be now, I decided to link ella this post as it hit twitter and i was worried she would hear about it anyway,  we will be working to reach a compromise.",

If all you care about is the aesthetic of your photos and not, you know, having your friends and family around for your big day, then just don't invite them. Or ask your photographer to photoshop their hair to a different color in the pictures. Or fucking have everyone wear hats.

I have just about this colour hair and I will never die it, because it is very difficult to get back to the same colour.

It also often has a thicker shaft, which also effects the dying.  She would never be able to die her hair back to the roots as they started growing in because natural red hair is very hard to colour match, so she would have this horrible fading brown with roots growing in, even if she used this temporary.  Not to mention damage from the chemicals\n\nWigs are hot, sweaty and uncomfortable, and you will seem like a giant asshole to everyone who asks what happened to her beautiful red hair and she says \"oh the bride thought I would ruin pictures\"\n\nPractical solution - put her hair in an updo or back of the neck bun that will be less obvious in photos",

It didn\u2019t ruin the photos, I didn\u2019t stick out, everyone was happy and life was good. Now my other sister is getting married. And she\u2019s asking me to dye my hair. As someone who has been dyeing her hair for so long, i can confidently say that those \u201c14 day dyes\u201d never last for just 14 days. Depending on hair type, health, etc, they can take a much stronger hold of the hair, and they almost always leave a tint. Before i even started dyeing my hair, my naturally colored haired friend used a brown one. It lasted for four freaking months. Not to mention, there\u2019s a reason this girl has grown her hair down to her butt and kept the bright red. It\u2019s her hair. It\u2019s a big part of her appearance. She likes it, it\u2019s what she\u2019s comfortable with. If she wants to hide her hair so bad, ask her to do a style that hides it in the back for photos like a braid or a pulled back sort of thing.
