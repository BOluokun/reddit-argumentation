  "post content": "We are in the process of moving into a new home. The house is more spacious then the old one but has limited rooms. It only has 3 rooms.\n\nMy wife and I have 3 daughters 16yo/14yo/12yo and one son 10yo. The problem that's been tearing the family apart right now is that my 16yo daughter is refusing to share a room with her 2 sisters, She wants her 10yo brother's room. Her argument is that her brother is too young to have his own room and that she deserves more privacy and space since she's the eldest. Thing is we, as a family always give the boys their own rooms no matter the age while the girls share a room together. This method has proven to be workig cause girls naturally share while boys don't and they fight a lot. \n\nMy daughter threw a rage fit and got my wife involved. My wife called me unreasonable for thinking it's fair to make the 3 girls share one room while our son gets an entire room for himself, and he's the youngest!! So he's the one with the \"least\" privacy. I told her that it's been like this for years and just cause we're moving into a new home doesn't mean things have to change, to be honest part of me is thinking that my 16yo is doing this simply because she's against the idea of moving in the first place and is looking for excuses to not move in to the new home, my wife argued that moving our 12yo daughter with our 10yo is the best compromise, but my son won't accept this and I already know that. all I'm looking for is for everyone to be happy and comfortable and to my understanding, my daughter was fine with sharing a room with her sisters then, why Change her mind now?. My wife still sided with her and said that I should be careful because the girls are beginning to sense some sort of favoritism towards my son which isn't true at all. but it's all about what we're used to and what is the norm in the family,\n\nThey're both not speaking to me and are acting somewhat hostile towards me.\n\nETA for those who are saying I was in the wrong for buying a 3bedroom house, well our financial situation isn't the best right with everything happening in the world and real-estate prices getting higher and whatnot. Also, those who are saying I'm favoring my son, I'm not, I treat him the same as his sisters in pretty much everything and I 100% guarantee it, I accept my verdict nonetheless but still wanted to make few points clear. Thanks anyway.",

Did you not count up your children when you were looking at houses?\n\nOf course adolescent girls shouldn't have to share a room with a boy. \n\nOf course your oldest,  at 16, wants some privacy.\n\nOf course she's pissed off that her brother gets his own room while all 3 girls are crammed into one room. \n\nYou created this situation. \n\nIs there a basement, covered porch,  attic space or den that could be converted into a 4th bedroom?\n\nAnd since so many people seem to think I don't understand what a budget is,  I'm not necessarily talking about a larger or significantly more expensive house.  I am talking about a decision like settling for potentially smaller rooms and a less convenient location or something with less curb appeal *in exchange* for that 4th bedroom.  \"More spacious\" isn't worth it if it doesn't meet the family's needs. I am not assuming a limitless budget,  I am saying that he picked the wrong trade-offs.",

Even if it isn't strictly (or legally) a bedroom I know some places have space that can be used as bedrooms. \n\nFor example, I had a friend in HS who wanted a bit more space. Her parents let her take over their basement. It wasn't an area that could technically be called a bedroom.  But there was a door so she had a decent amount of privacy. The laundry room was down there - but her parents were fine with giving her a heads up whenever they were doing laundry. \n\nI also had a cousin who was having medical problems, it caused her to have some really bad hot flashes. So her and her husband turned the basement into their bedroom.  They had to go up a flight for a toilet and two for the shower - not ideal but they had to make due.  Since they didn't want to play favorites and allow one of their kids to move into the master, they turned it into a TV room for the kids to hang out in. Now that she no longer has those hot flashes, they have been able to move back to the master. One of their kids recently moved back in after a bad break up and has currently taken over the basement as her room/living space. Their other child is out of the house.  \n\nI have used a basement as my bedroom before too. And it wasn't even a finished one. Seriously, it didn't even have walls. Like it insulated and covered in plastic - those were the walls of my basement \"bedroom.\" I did have to share the space with my sister sometimes but I had privacy for the most part being down there. \n\n\nBasically what I am saying is that they could have a spot in the house that can be used as a bedroom even if it isn't technically a bedroom.",
