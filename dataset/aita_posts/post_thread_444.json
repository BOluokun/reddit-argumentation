  "post content": "My (16, M) family has a pet parrot. They are all pretty much obsessed with him and my younger and older sisters both keep buying him toys, new food, making him new fruit and vegetable mixes to try out etc. My parents also pay a lot of attention to him and even set up the extra room we have for his cage so he can sleep better at night. He has been with us for a few months now and my family's obsession still hasn't died down.\n\nI've been mostly indifferent since I'm not the biggest fan of animals and my parents keep him away from my room. Luckily for me it seems like he doesn't like me anyways so it's even easier to avoid him flying to my shoulder or anything like that. \n\nThe problem though is that today my sister Emma (10,F) was talking quietly to that bird. She was holding him and saying things like \"You know I love you right?\" and kissing him on the head while the parrot would just mimic the sound. It went on for a while and she repeated that enough that it seemed like she was looking for a response so I told her \"You know he doesn't understand you right\". \n\nAfter I said that she just looked at me and made a sour face and ignored me. I didn't want her to actually believe this bird can understand what she is saying since she watches a lot of Disney movies so I feel like they could have given her the wrong idea. I gently explained to her that it's just a bird and that he doesn't understand things like we do. She told me to stop bothering her and ended up leaving the room and told my mom about it.\n\nMy mom told me she believed it was harmless for my sister to talk to her pet and that the bird \"reciprocated her feelings\". So I told her that this will harm my sister's way of thinking and get her bullied at school. She told me to drop it and not get involved anymore. AITA? I think my sister is old enough to understand what I'm saying and my mom is just too nice.",

They knew their friend was gone, so we gave them some time to grieve their companion. I know chickens can be described as quite savage, but when our rooster passed away the entire flock of hens acted so depressed. They didn't eat, they quit laying eggs - their cycles were all over the place. They free range during the day and majority of them wouldn't even come outside. I thought they were sick, the vet came out and told us they were depressed basically. I have one chicken that waits for the bus everyday for my daughter, she sits by the mailbox same time everyday and listens for the bus. My cockatiels especially are very bonded, if one leaves the cage they both are very, very upset and not afraid to show it. We try not to seperate them but we had to recently and they were extremely upset until they were introduced again. Ok I'm going to quit ranting about birds, but they definitely are amazing animals!",

Birds in general, parrots moreso, are exceedingly smarter than most people expect.  \n\nThe key is to think of talking to most animals as talking to a foreign person.  Even if you don't understand the words, you pick up tone, subtext, etc.  And, given enough time, you will learn some of that language.  Just like I know which of my dog's barks means food versus which means play, and how I know if my cat just saw something interesting in the other room.  \n\nAlso, animals, birds included, do form emotional relationships with others, those of their own species and those of other species.  So, yeah, if your sister is nice to the bird, takes care of it, and shows it affection, it likely does reciprocate her feelings.\n\nAnd beyond that, there's no harm to letting her believe so.\n\nSo you're doubly TA.
