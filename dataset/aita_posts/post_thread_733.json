  "post content": "There\u2019s a massive amount of backstory to this situation so I\u2019ll try and keep it clear and to the point. \n\nI was raised a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. My whole family are witnesses. At 25 I decided that it was not the religion for me. Unfortunately, if you are baptized in the faith there is a strict shunning policy that is enforced if you decide to leave. It sucks. \n\nWhen I left, my father decided that, even though it means he can\u2019t hold any positions of privilege in the congregation, he was not going to shun his  oldest child. My mother followed his lead. My siblings (I\u2019m the oldest of 5) are a mixed bag. \n\nAt the point when I left I was still on my family\u2019s phone and gym plan (charged automatically to my dads account). My dad also supplied me with a car that is in his name and he pays the insurance. In order to pay my father, I would stop by the house once a month and drop off cash. It was a nice \u201cofficial\u201d way for me to visit briefly with the family that everyone was okay with. My family does not reach out to me otherwise. The 2-4xs a year I talk to my family is by me reaching out to them over texts. \n\nThen my grandma moved in with my parents. My grandma follows the shunning policy very strictly and will not say a word to me/is uncomfortable by my presence. Out of respect for my grandma (I\u2019m really trying to take the high road) I stopped my visits to the house. For months I\u2019ve been reaching out to my dad asking him how we can get together so I can pay him. But I want to pay him in person because this is the only communication we have. He dodges and doesn\u2019t answer. \n\nSo I decided I\u2019m not tracking him down anymore. If he wants me to pay then he can reach out to me. This week I ran into him at the gym because I randomly didn\u2019t go at my normal time. He mentioned the bills he\u2019s paying (in a sarcastic but serious kind of way). I told him we should get a drink sometime and talk about it. He mentioned it again in the conversation and I told him that I miss him and want to catch him up on my life. He switched tones and acted like it would be something he\u2019s interested in. \n\nMy plan is to ride this out and let him reach out to me first to make plans. The thing is my dad is 70 now and still working full time. My family lives a comfortable life but is by no means rich. Also this means I\u2019m manipulating him the same way my family is trying to manipulate me (by with-holding communication so I turn back to the faith vs. me with holding money so that he reaches out to me). I want to know \n\nAm I the Asshole?",
