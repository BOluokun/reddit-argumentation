  "post content": "For context I F(22) have two vehicles at the moment, a 2015 coupe and a motorcycle. I got my car back in 2020 when I bought it from my grandparents via a loan I took out in my name. Ever since I got my car, it was kind of an understanding that my mom F(43) may ask to use it once in a while. She already has three vehicles of her own. A truck, a coupe, and a motorcycle are all either in the front of the house or in the garage. It doesn't bother me a lot since my car isn't a newer model and it is my first car so mistakes have been made. Well, my loan will be paid off on the car next fall, and I am looking to get an SUV. My reasons are that by next fall both of our dogs will be 70lbs+ so it will be nice with how much we take them to the dog park, living in the northern midwest, it will be amazing to have in winter for the ice/snow. Here is where I think I might be the a-hole. My mom has helped me with the loan at some point. I told her since she uses my car just as much as I do, whether it is to take care of the dogs, just drive it daily, or take it across the country for a road trip with her friend. Then I want her to put money towards it.\n\nI told her the other day that come fall when I get my SUV, I want to sell the 2015 coupe so that I don't have three vehicles in my name, being a college student, I definitely can't afford that amount of Insurance payments. Getting a loan for my new vehicle won't be hard since the coupe will be paid off and I am being reasonable by looking for something that would be a similar monthly payment as what I have now. My mother practically snapped at me mid-sentence claiming that I can't sell it since she put money into it and that she will pay the insurance on it instead of me. After she finished her outburst, I tried to rationalize to her the fact that she already has three vehicles of her own.  She would not budge on the fact of keeping my coupe. I looked at her and told her that if she wants to keep my coupe then she needs to sell her 2006 coupe. We really don't need the six vehicles between the two of us....AITA for giving the ultimatum?",

Yes I do pay rent to my mother for a grand total of 800 which is the average rate for my area for a 1bedroom apartment plus the phone bill which has both of our phones on it. \n\nAnd for the number of vehicles, she has I want to add some details. Within the past 2 years, my mother has let my grandparents move in. Between her and them the total of vehicles is 7, not including the farm equipment. Before they moved in my mother was reluctant to let me park my car in any of the shelters we have much less the garage, unless there was a SERIOUS storm. I am talking about blizzards or tornadoes kind of serious. But she has made the effort to find space for their vehicles and equipment to be parked inside a shelter year-round.",

The trip to the destination, there and back without including the driving around different nearby, is a total of 3,000 miles. If for some reason she got into an accident while on the trip. I would have taken that thousand out of the loan and put it towards my insurance deductible for repairs.",
