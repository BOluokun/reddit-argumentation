  "post content": "My cousin-in-law \u201cStella\u201d has been obsessed with having the first great-grandchild in our family ever since she married my cousin 5 years ago. When her daughter was born, she was constantly going on and on about how she was my grandfather\u2019s first great-grandchild and how her daughter was the family legacy. It was annoying but her daughter is adorable, so we all sucked it up and humoured her.\n\nWell, 3 months ago my older brother, who is my grandfather\u2019s golden boy, found out he had a son. Without going into too much detail, my brother met \u201cKiera\u201d while he was at a very low point in his life and was taking a \u2018break\u2019 (i.e. hiding away) from life/our family. He gave her a fake backstory and name so when he left, she had no way to contact him to let him know she was pregnant. It took her until 3 months ago to finally get in touch with him.\n\nThis has caused a whole scandal in my family because my brother is the last person anyone would think would accidentally father a child. My cousins all though this would knock him off the golden boy pedestal, but my grandfather was worried my brother would never have kids, so this has had the opposite effect. From what my cousin/Stella's SIL has told me, Stella was fuming when she found out because my nephew is 2 months older than her daughter. Making him the 'first' great grandchild.\n\nMy brother is trying to convince Kiera to relocate to our city so when she brought their son so our family could meet him, we were all on our best behaviour. Stella hated it. She kept complaining everyone was treating my nephew better than they had ever treated her daughter and she started accusing my grandfather of being misogynistic. After the third day of her complaining, I told her to stop being a bitter cow because her daughter was no longer the first great-grandchild.\n\nShe\u2019s since told everyone what I said, and my aunt scolded me for being insensitive and basically made this whole thing about Stella and how hard this was for her. My cousin also sent me a long message which essentially said I was an insensitive AH.\n\nAITA?",

([Pdf here](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0022/91624/OfcomOffensiveLanguage.pdf))\n\n'Cow' came out in the mild category, alongside 'arse', 'bloody', 'bugger', 'crap', 'damn', 'minger', and telling someone to 'sod off'. Those words were generally considered of little concern. \n\n> \u2018Milder words\u2019 were those that participants felt expressed strong emotions, or were used as light-hearted insults. Many of \rthese were thought to be in common use, including in front of children, and therefore mostly acceptable before the \rwatershed. \n\nYou would likely get away with a kids show like Tracy Beaker calling someone a bitter cow.\n\nMeanwhile 'Cunt' was in the most offensive category, alongside 'fuck', 'motherfucker', and the most offensive racial/homophobic/ableist slurs.\n\n> Participants classed a small number of terms such as \u2018fuck\u2019, \u2018motherfucker\u2019 and \u2018cunt\u2019 as the strongest and most offensive terms in this category of non-discriminatory language. They were seen to express very strong emotions, or to be rude and aggressive insults. The cultural norms around these words meant they were less acceptable to use in front of children. \r\n\n> They were considered unacceptable before the watershed by the vast majority of participants.\r Responses to the word \u2018cunt\u2019 were particularly strong. A significant number of participants were uncomfortable with its use \reven after the watershed.\n\nSo I guess whether OP is an arsehole depends on how bad it is to call someone a cow where they are.",
