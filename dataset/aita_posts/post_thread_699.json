  "post content": "Growing up my mom always taught me body autonomy, and also not to be an asshole to women. As a result I've never been controlling in my marriage and don't think highly of men who try to control their partners.\n\nNow for the issue. My mom and my wife hate each other. They can hardly be in the same room and obviously I chose my wife, but I'm not ready for full no contact with my mom, so we do still see each other on important days such as her wedding.\n\nMy wife wasn't excited for my mom's wedding as she thinks my mom ruined our wedding with her complaining, refusing to wear what she was told, refusing to brush her hair, calling us assholes for having a black tie wedding, and basically showing up in a gown, but everything else looked underdone, hair, makeup, etc. She felt she was showing off, and showing how she didn't care.\n\nI was nervous about how she would act at my mom's wedding. She came down in a full on gown, like a wedding dress, and I begged her to change, but she said no, and if i wouldn't drive her she would uber, so I was like fine whatever. I don't think I get to be the ultimate authority on what she wears, and also I doubted my mom would care. I cannot even describe how laid back she is.\n\nI'm not sure if my mom even saw the dress. If she did there was zero reaction. She didn't really talk to us, but her friends were there, and I'm not sure she likes us much these days. My wife was embarrassing me as she was massively overdressed and clearly trying to be the bride.\n\nThe issue is my grandmother, my grandfather (divorced) and the groom's mom cussed us out. I was really verbally abused over it, so I snapped at them that maybe their marriages suck, but I have no control over my wife. I even texted my mom after the fact and asked if she was mad. She said she thought it was funny and told them to calm down, so I feel vindicated but idk.",

Of course you don't \"control\" your wife or what she wears. But as two adults, you should both be acting better than this. You end up being an AH because you are trying to walk a very fine line between your mom and your wife and you'll never succeed doing that.\n\nMeanwhile, you're humble bragging sounds disingenuous and a cop-out for actually mediating peace between the two women in your life. Good luck, dude. Hope you don't have kids.",
