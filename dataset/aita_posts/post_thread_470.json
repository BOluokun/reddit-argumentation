  "post content": "EDIT: He also puts his tuna sandwiches in the toaster oven, which smells up the office. But he isn't bothered by that and no one bats an eyelash.\n\nOkay, so here's the deal. I recently cut out red meat from my diet for health reasons and have only been eating seafood. Many days, I would often bring vegetarian dishes to work but being that I also eat fish, maybe once or twice a month, I'd bring a piece of fish to have with a salad and bread. \n\nMy coworker and boss bring and warm up foods that I don't eat or don't like the smell of (Indian food, food smelling strongly of garlic etc.) but I'm not childish and I know that I won't have to eat their food and the smell will eventually go away, plus we have air freshener. \n\nToday, I brought a piece of salmon and a salad for lunch and my coworker (who also brings tuna to work) freaked out about how bad he hates the smell of fish. He literally left the office for like an hour even though I ate everything within 10 minutes and aired out the office and sprayed air freshener. \n\nHe then comes back and emphasizes again that he hates the smell of fish and how it made him feel like he was going to throw up and he got a migraine from it and had to take medicine. Then he had my boss use disinfectant spray to clean out the microwave. \n\nLet me reiterate, I VERY RARELY bring seafood to work. It's not at all an everyday thing, but I do need more substenance than a salad or grilled cheese some days. \n\nPlease (respectfully) let me know if I'm the ass hole.",
