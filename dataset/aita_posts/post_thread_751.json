  "post content": "I broke up with my ex 2 years ago when I caught her sucking my uncle's dick which was apparently my fault somehow. Fuck her and fuck my uncle, he's been disowned by the rest of the family.  I rarely use Facebook so i didn't notice or really care I was still friends with her on it and i guess she was the same.\n\nI decided to check it because someone told me they posted some cool pics of a place they recently went to so I checked it out and i saw of my ex's photos on my feed. After our break up my ex went into a depression and started binge eating and became severely obese, you wouldn't recognize the two as the same person. She apparently had gained around 170 pounds and now weighs 320 or so and is only 5'6.\n\nShe made a bunch of posts with unflattering pictures of Trump and pictures of Trump eating fast food and other stuff where she went off about how he's a disgusting fat pig and a slob and a bunch of other ways to basically describe that he's fat. This stuff was basically the pot calling the kettle African American so I responded back with on one of the posts \"those who live in glass houses should not throw stones, yes Trump isn't the healthiest but your obesity problem is far greater than his, don't make fun of other people's bodies when you lead way unhealthier life styles. Your BMI is undoubtedly bigger, sure you may not like Trump, i don't agree with everything he does either, but criticize his actions and policies, not call him fat, that's rude and distasteful\"\n\nShe immediately blocked me and made another post about how her evil ex broke up with her over a silly mistake and is now fat shaming her and i ruined her life just basically trying to get sympathy for herself. Her friends texted me saying I'm an asshole for fatshaming her and i shouldn't bring up such a sensitive topic.\n\nEDIT: I'm black and that joke wasn't racist, its funny af maybe you guys don't like my humor idk. Im over my ex, i don't give a shit about her, just thought that post was ridiculous, i made that comment and went about my day not thinking anything about it until the drama happened",
