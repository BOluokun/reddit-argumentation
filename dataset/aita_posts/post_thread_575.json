She is my world and I want nothing but the best for her. Truly. My daughter gets to see her Mother's side of the family daily. This is because we have been living with them as we continue to save money before moving out permanently. My daughter loves them all and of course I do too. In the past I would travel to my Mom's house and visit for the sake of my kid (and I wanted to see her too of course). Sadly, it is rare that my Mom would travel to see us and that didn't seem to bother me until it became a regular thing. We always had to come visit her for my kid to get exposure with her Grandma. Lately though, my Mother has moved further away from us and the drive over there was adding on an additional hour each way. Honestly a total pain in the ass because I already commute a ton and I'm tired of the drive. My mom has been trying to get us to come over there and I have refused. I have asked her to come down to us instead but she hasn't directly answered my request. At this point my Mother hasn't seen my kid in over a month and it's starting to bug me. My kiddo is growing so much and I feel like she's missing out. The last time she saw her, she wasn't even crawling yet, and now She's a master at it. As I type this I'm thinking maybe I should just communicate how I feel with her but.... What do you think Reddit? Am I being unreasonable here? \n\nMy mom is not a bad person either. She has done a lot for us, saved us from a really bad situation with my Biological Father. I am here because of her. That being said, I just want my daughter to have a better childhood than mine filled with love and family.",
