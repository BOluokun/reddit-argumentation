  "post content": "I'm sorry if the title isn't accurate, I can't think of another description to describe the \"training\".\n\nMy cousin Amy (25F) has (6M) twins and has a nasty habit of dumping them onto relatives to babysit for the entire day without any warning or regard for their time. I (27F) have a very strained relationship with her but because my mom's side of the family demands that we all remain close-knit, so I have no choice to tolerate her.\n\nWhen she initially gave birth to them, she teased me that I'll have to take on babysitting duty from now on. I'm no good with kids, so I remarked to her that if I ever have them, I'll train them, not babysit. She brushed me off.\n\nThe kids now are hella destructive and loud. Pulling out stuffing inside furniture, holes inside walls, smashing anything glass and porcelain, screaming louder than a fire alarm, you name it. When it was my first turn to deal with them, I immediately walked with them to the store and grabbed the biggest bag of M&M's I could find and trained them so that every time they follow my orders and behave, they get one. If they misbehave, I get one.\n\nSoon enough, every time the kids were dumped on me, they went with my guidelines and behaved. Whenever I say sit, they sit at the table. When I say stay, they don't leave that spot, etc.\n\nTwo days ago there was a party planned with the whole extended family (I know, pandemic. Didn't want to, but mom insisted) and I grabbed the M&M's since the twins were there. Arrived, twins were being so destructive (an entire tray of food was spilled) that all the adults had enough and yelled at Amy to control them. She vomited the same excuse of them just being kids and they'll grow out of it eventually.\n\nI shouted the twins' names and shook my M&M bag. They came running over to me and I popped 6  pieces into my mouth for their misbehavior. I told them to go clean up the mess or no candy all night. They do so.\n\nHalfway through the party, every time something similar came up or they just weren't behaving, I was the one able to calm them down. When Amy saw what I was doing, she got angry and started yelling at me about how her children aren't animals and that I shouldn't be giving them so much candy anyway. I told her that I'm their aunt, not their parent, why am I the one disciplining them? Isn't that her job?\n\nShe screamed the same argument at me and since she's their mother, to stop giving them candy. One of the twins overheard and went apeshit. Dashed straight into the kitchen and started shattering anything they can get his hands on, shouting over and over that he wants candy. His twin joined him soon after. \n\nI repeated that she's their mother, and just sat in the living room watching it all unfold. At the end, Amy blamed me for them turning out this way. The other relatives she dumped them on (a majority) disagreed, but when I told a friend about the situation, he told me that the training I did can really fuck up the kids mentally later in life. \n\nSo, AITA?",

Kids understand much more than we give them credit for.\n\nFor anyone reading, I highly recommend instilling rules and expectations from the moment they can walk. Will they meet those expectations? Fuck no, but you've set the standard before they even know anything else, so they grow up knowing that we don't smash people's belongings, or kick holes in walls, or spill platters of food, etc. OP is trying to undo the shitty behavior her cousin has made acceptable, which is so much harder than just instructing from a young age.\n\nOP is absolutely NTA, and incredibly incentive.",

If they attack you, don't react.\n\nThe *second* they stop immediately turn to them and smile. Have a plan of someway of engaging them, like a toy, or TV, or game. But the second they revert, you also immediately stop and go back to a blank expression. \n\nVery quickly they figure out what will get them what they want.\n\nOften kids who act out so excessively are those who don't receive enough outlet for the energy or simple pleasures. They're constantly being punished more than they can withstand, so they've learned they *must* ignore boundaries in order to function. So the reward of kindness and engagement is super effective. *Don't make them wait* you reward them immediately when they're in the super destructive state. Chances are their parents are punishing them for hours or days and rarely reward them or wait excessively long before a smaller-than-appropriate reward.
