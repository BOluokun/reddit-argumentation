  "post content": "  \n\nMy SO (32M) and I (27F) are expecting our first child by the end of 2020. We\u2019re beyond excited and can\u2019t wait to meet our baby.\n\nWe\u2019re friends with a couple (27F, Amber) (33M, John) who we\u2019ve known for many years by now. They are childfree and have made it clear that they do not want children now or in the future. That is completely fine, and we\u2019re both respectful of each other\u2019s choices. \n\nNow, since we announced the pregnancy John has been teasing us pretty much at every possible moment, saying things like \u201cSuch a shame you\u2019ll never go on a vacation again now that you\u2019re having a child\u201d, \u201chope you\u2019ll think of me sleeping in when you\u2019re up before 6 every day for the next 10 years\u201d and \u201cIt sucks that you have to spend so much money on all this child stuff, huh? You might as well wave goodbye to every single paycheck for the rest of your lives.\u201d He also loves to remind us that he will never ever look after our child, because he wouldn\u2019t trust it to behave around their dogs. I was starting to get a bit annoyed with these comments, because they always come out of nowhere and I have never asked them to babysit in the future. However, my understanding was that we were joking around so I let it slide.\n\nLast weekend when we visited Amber and John, he started with the comments again, saying that he would never look after our child and that he was not a childcare service, so if we ever \u201cdumped\u201d our child on him, he would probably just keep it in the garden until we came back. Maybe it was pregnancy hormones, maybe I just had enough, but I ended up snapping at him, saying that he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about looking after our child, because they were at the very bottom of the list of people I would ever trust to babysit. He shut up instantly, giggled a bit and then went back to whatever we were talking about before his comments. It wasn\u2019t mentioned for the rest of the night, so I assumed that everything was fine.\n\nThen yesterday Amber wrote me and said that John had been acting grumpy the entire week, and he had finally opened up about what was bothering him. Apparently, my comment had been out of line, and he was deeply hurt that I wouldn\u2019t trust my child with him. He had only been joking, but my comment was hurtful and unnecessary, he felt.\n\nTo be fair I only said what I said because I was annoyed. We would never hesitate to let them look after our child if they wanted to. And I should probably have brought it up with him in a calm manner before I ended up snapping at him. But on the other hand, I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong in standing up for myself.\n\nAITA for telling our friend I don\u2019t want him to look after our child?",

My very best friend just had her first baby yesterday and I felt nothing but joy and happiness and was supportive to her through her pregnancy because I love her and respect her life choices. John isn\u2019t a very supportive friend, he poked and poked and poked at you, and I think your reaction was justified. He needed to learn that his jokes weren\u2019t funny.",
