  "post content": "My husband and I have been married almost 3 years. In that time he's worked a total of 6 months and has had more jobs than I have in my entire life. We've had a lot of financial rough patches with me being the sole earner. \n We've been behind on all of our bills and I thought this week was going to be the first time we were actually going to be caught up. So I told him I could probably give him more money than usual like $150 and we could maybe go out to eat. Well I was wrong. We have one more big bill. \nThis morning he left to go see a friend. He took the debit card and called to ask to take $80.  I had the card turned off because we were overdrawn until I got paid. He came home when he realized this. He asked me to turn the card on so he could have $80. I was still in bed and I hadn't even checked the bank account. So I said I'll bring you money when I get up. He asked how much. I told him probably $40. He threw a fit. \nHe does do all the cooking. He complains I don't do enough housework so he does none of it. I do all the laundry. I do what housework is done after working full time. \nWhy I think I'm an ass hole: I did tell him he could probably have more this week. Instead he can only have his normal amount\nEdit: He did not get any money today. I told him to stay at his friends. I took the dog with me to work in case he threw another tantrum. I have cameras so I'll know if he comes home.",

You don\u2019t have to hire the lawyer. \n\nYou might need a divorce lawyer and a real estate lawyer consult. The latter is to learn how to remove him from your home. It takes a few steps and maybe a few months, but it is very doable. \n\nIf you know someone who is divorced, ask who they used as a lawyer and if they were satisfied with the work. Call that lawyers office to see if they will do a free consult. Uncontested divorces are pretty cheap. \n\nAlternatively, you can Google your \u201c[state] bar association.\u201d They have a phone number you can call to get referrals to divorce and real estate lawyers in your area who will do a free consult. They might charge about $35 or so for the referral.  \n\nI commend you for working so hard to get and keep your finances straight. It\u2019s a lot of work. Good for you for putting in the longstanding effort. \n\nI hope you update us. I wish you the best. \u2764\ufe0f",
