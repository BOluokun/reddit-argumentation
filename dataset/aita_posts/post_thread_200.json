  "post content": "Months ago, my wife and I got a great deal on a family cruise with our kids up to Alaska (late summer trip). Since that time, I have paid off the cruise, scheduled/paid-for a number of upgrades (tours, drink packages, etc.), flights from our home city, hotel arrangements so we can tour the port city, airport parking, etc. I have also made arrangements with family in the port city to visit with them for a few days before our sailing date. My wife on the other hand has been watching cruise videos on YouTube, as well as talked to friends that are in a much higher income bracket than we are and decided the ship we are sailing on is too small (it\u2019s the smallest ship in this particular line\u2019s fleet). She has been on one cruise in her life on a similarly sized ship and had a good time but apparently this one does not have enough activities to keep our kids out of her hair (it has a kids club, arcade, and pool, etc. but what do I know). She has looked online for other cruises and found one on the same line that is leaving the same port a day earlier and is three days shorter that she likes better. She has asked (it feels more like a demand) that I call the cruise company and change over to this trip, then change everything else associated with it (flights, car rental, hotels, time with family \u2013 which will now be a day less, etc.). I looked at just the base cost of the new cruise on the bigger ship and it would cost us significantly more (new shorter cruise = old longer cruise with all of the tours and add-ons added on). I already think our budget is being stretched by this trip as it is presently scheduled. My answer was and continues to be a very firm \u201cno\u201d. She is now upset with me and thinks I am being unreasonable (code for A-hole).",

We have sat down and looked at the places we want to take the kids, what that looks like in terms of money and time frame, and decided what amount of money we are able to save towards those goals... \n\nobviously stuff comes up, but my husband just started a new job in August, and I started a new job last May, so we just re-did this whole process in the past 6 months...\n\nwhen we plan vacations we both know what the budget we currently have is, and how much we're saving going forward.  So it's easy to look at options and know what is or is not realistic for us.  \n\nWhen I read OP's story he tells it like he found the deal, she okayed it, then he did everything else to arrange it, and now she's popping her head in, making suggestions that aren't realistic to their budget, which makes me wonder, why doesn't she know and understand their budget well enough to immediately know that what she's suggesting is not realistic for them?\n\nIt seems like there's been a breakdown BEFORE this particular situation started, where they are not on the same page...  so I wonder WHY?",

Including some lotteries that can only be entered the day before the hike in question (which required finding internet service while camping).  So even though we started booking reservations 6 months ago, we still didn't know exactly what the itinerary would be until 18 hours before in some instances (lottery results at 4pm for a hike that starts at 9am the next day).\n\nBut we knew all that when we made the choice to take that vacation...  listening to someone say planning a vacation is hard is like listening to my old boss saying how hard it was to find a financial manager for her trust fund...  like, yeah...  what do you expect, it's still a privilege that that's how I get to use my time.

Sounds you have planned a great trip and I know how much work one have to put into this. \n\nPersonally I have a hard time with people snobbing up - I always go for longer, not so luxiorious trips  - The people you meet are often funnier, down to earth and who doesn't want to be away for a longer time. \n\nI would tell her she can plan, book and budget the next trip, but this one is perfect timed and arranged as it is.",

They\u2019re easier to navigate, activities rarely fill up so you can show up last minute if you decide to just go and wing it, and if you are social, smaller shops mean you run into the same people more and make those connections. \nMegaships just get so impersonal.",
