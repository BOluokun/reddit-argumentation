  "post content": "For the past week, my wife and I had been anticipating a baseball game for which we had purchased tickets. We like baseball, but we don't attend many games, so traveling into the city to see games is a rare treat. I know, though, that it would take time to drive there and find parking, due to traffic. Because the game started at 7 PM, and we live about 45 minutes from the stadium, I told her this morning that she needed to be ready to get in the car and go by 6 PM. \n\nWell, my wife is an avid gamer, so she was engrossed in her latest video game when the clock struck 5:45 PM. She has struggled to plan in the past, and I get tired of reminding her that she needs to budget time to get ready. It's as if she has no concept of time at all, similar to a young child. Well, I was ready to go by 6 PM, and she was in the bathroom. I saw this as an opportunity to teach her personal responsibility, so I simply left the house without saying a word, got in the car, and started driving to the game.\n\nIt took my wife a few minutes to figure out what I had done, but when she called me, she was absolutely furious. She said that it was a completely unacceptable move for me to leave without telling her and that she now had no way to get to the game without paying for parking. I told her that I got tired of constantly waiting for her and that she would plan better next time if she didn't want to get left behind. I also reminded her that I had told her that morning when I expected her to be ready to leave. Absolutely none of this seemed to matter, though, and she rudely hung up on me after yelling out more insults.\n\nFrankly, I think it's completely insane that a grown woman is unable to budget her time, and I'm starting to suspect that she is doing this on purpose because she's a narcissist who expects me to accommodate her. After all, she's not a dumb woman. She has a science degree. Well, she never showed up to the stadium, and I didn't hear from her the whole game, but when I got home, there was a note on the door. She told me that I wasn't welcome in the bedroom and that I should sleep on the couch. I can't believe she wants to be this much of a pill. If I had waited for her, I would have missed the first pitch. I made my expectations clear, and she couldn't be bothered to meet them. I feel like she should be apologizing to me. AITA?",

          "content": "Yup. To leave without a word is an AH move. You could have said something. Even \u201cI told you we need to leave at 6, it\u2019s 3 minutes to I\u2019m going to put my shoes on, let\u2019s go\u201d\n\nOr when you know someone always needs that extra time, you tell them you want to be gone sooner. When planning things with my in-laws if it is just us and his parents we can set a time and be good. When the BIL and nephew are in town, we always say \u201clet\u2019s plan to leave by 9, which means pulling out by 930\u201d. Add the two extra people and the kids run wild and it just takes longer. We plan for it. We still tell the kids and everyone 9. But the two of us know more than likely it will be 930. So tell your wife an earlier time. If she\u2019s actually ready, great you\u2019re early. But just do the easy thing and build in your buffer. \n\nAnd while you had a few hours to enjoy the game and drive home she\u2019s been stewing about how you just left. Didn\u2019t tell her or warn her. And it could have taken her a few minutes to call as she was looking for you. Telling you she\u2019s ready. Not getting a response. Finding the car is gone and staring dumbstruck that you would leave without a word. So that isn\u2019t a bedroom I would want to be sleeping in. Because you\u2019re both not showing each other and love or respect.\n\nEdit to add: I get she\u2019s made him late numerous times. And maybe it\u2019s the parent of young kids in me that says \u201cwell we just say we are leaving sooner\u201d.  But the whole point is that he stopped communicating. When he left without saying a word, he stopped communicating. And if she was in the bathroom\u2026. He doesn\u2019t say what she was doing. Doing to the bathroom (good idea before you go for an hour plus drive).  Not to mention he doesn\u2019t say how late she usually is. Some people one minute is too late. They need to be in the car at 6 driving away. Others it\u2019s shoes on and heading out the door. So without knowing how this guy views punctual, it\u2019s hard to say.  And if she\u2019s usually 15 min late and she\u2019s only going to be 1 minute this time, I would consider that a win. It\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s a whole lot better. \nYes he\u2019s trying to prove a point. And I get that. But to prove your point then be mad when she\u2019s upset about it.  What did he expect?",

Once, My aunt planned a HUGE get together to celebrate a then recent business success. We HAD to be there by 2. I told my aunt explicitly to text me that it was at 1. When my husband finally got his ass out the door, it was the first time i wasnt pissed at him in *years* for making us late. \n\nHis unmedicated ADHD made it soo bad. It wasn't even funny.  He'd decide last second to shave his face, then shower, etc etc. Wed *finally* leave and He'd have to stop for gas and snacks for the trip almost immediately.  Like havent even gone 4 blocks immediately.  When i pulled this on him,  he stopped and asked why i wasnt mad at him as  it was 1 oclock and it takes an hour to get to my aunt's house. I looked him straight in the eye and said i lied about the time and that we'd actually left on time. Hed started getting ready at 12. Yes a whole *ass hour*. I think it was only then that he realized how bad it had gotten.  We'd used the same tactic on his own mom multiple times,  and on his step mom at least twice. He *never* did it again. It really is nice to be able to leave on time and arrive within minutes of the set time. \n\nNow i tell him what time we need to leave to make it and he doesnt question me about it.",

We showed up right on time (he was expecting the party to be in full swing by the time we got there and it wasn't) and I had to tell him that I lied and said the party started an hour earlier than it did so we could make it on time.  We haven't been late to anything since then.",

If you despise your partner that much, perhaps it's time to re-evaluate your relationship.\n\nYou communicate, your partner fails to respect your boundaries, then you give up and choose yourself.

Based on these test results I'd say you have a thirty percent chance of still being alive.\")",

Secondly, she was in the bathroom preparing and was a few minutes from being ready. Your response was disproportionate. Thirdly, you did not lay out the extreme consequences ahead of time. That probably wouldn't have saved you from AH status, but then it would have been more of her choice. Fourthly, your wife, as u/johnhodgman would point out, is a human being in her own right. She is not your child for you to discipline if she falls short of your standards.\n\nYou know she doesn't budget her time well. Let her know well beforehand if it's an important event. Reminding her an hour ahead of time and every 15 minutes after that, for instance. If you plan to do something so severe in the future, discuss that with her ahead of time.",

Wasting someones time and being constantly late regardless of if it\u2019s a symptom of ADHD is rude and unacceptable and honestly makes that person a massive dick.

My dad and I were never late to stuff because it gave us huge anxiety. We were always early. The shame of people thinking less of us was such a motivator for being early. But that meant we usually just sat around waiting to leave instead of doing anything before going. Like, I can't do the dishes because I have to leave the house in 45 minutes and what if washing dishes ends up taking me an hour? Absolutely irrational stuff. My sister was constantly late to everything so it was different for her. \n\nThe pandemic really fucked with my arrival times because during various lockdowns, businesses didn't want you arriving early for appointments. Normally I'd be 15 minutes early, but with them trying to reduce people hanging out in waiting rooms together they'd ask you to arrive no more than a couple minutes before your appointment time. This was sooooo hard for me, and I ended up becoming the person who is often late - usually only by a couple minutes and five at most, but it was such a different switch for me. \n\nNow I'm usually right on time, or a couple minutes early, and I don't have that constant \"waiting room\" feeling like I can't start anything when I know I have to be somewhere at a certain time. What really helped was the recommendation to time how long it took you to do certain tasks - it'll take two minutes to respond to that email, 5 minutes to unload the dishwasher, two minutes to switch over laundry - and reinforce that these tasks don't take much time and you can budget for them. I'm always looking up directions and double checking how long a route will take so I can appropriately time everything. It's a lot of mental energy, but honestly I think I spent the same amount of brain power panicking about stuff I needed to do but wouldn't do because I worried it would make me late for somewhere I had to be in 4 hours. \n\nThe baby step to getting where I'm at was telling myself every chore took 15 minutes, even if it took significantly less. I'd just budget 15 minute time slots in my mind to get small tasks done. It made it possible to accomplish things by saying \"I have time to get 4 15-minute tasks done\" instead of overanalyzing the amount of time I'd need and end up doing nothing at all.",

She's inconsiderate of him and the way OP went about is kinda wrong.
