I understand i might 100% upset my mom (48f) with this but my mom isn\u2019t really here for me or my siblings. Me and my boyfriend (15m) have been also thinking about our future and possibly future wedding which we would love to have when he\u2019s about 30 if all goes according to what we\u2019ve planned. Well due to us thinking that I\u2019ve been thinking about who would walk me down the isle and my father is out of the picture and I will have to attend my wedding as she wasn\u2019t invited to any of my sibling\u2019s weddings but I don\u2019t want her boyfriend to walk me so my immediate answer would be my sister\u2019s husband as he\u2019s more fatherly figure to me. I mean they treat me like I\u2019m person and perfectly normal one but what if it hurts them and my mom that I don\u2019t see my mom as my mom but just as a woman who provides food and water and roof over my head just because she has to? And my father is well no one to me just a drunk man who abused my sister brother and mom and me well practically just a sperm donor. So would I be the a-hole if I told my sister and her husband that they\u2019re more of parents to me than my bio parents?",

But your plans will not go the complete way you want it. That's not how life works. Personally, I don't think it's bad to tell your sister and BIL how much you appreciate what they've done for you. But I think you are pulling the cart before the horse a little too much at 15. You've got a long way to go to get to that point.",

Also my plans I meant our distant relationship as he lives thousands miles from me so our plan was wait for my bf to graduate and fly here get the citizenship here and wait till I finish my future studies as I would love to be a teacher then possibly go back to the USA and I\u2019d get citizenship here and we would live there together but we do know and understand that it might not work and not go according to that",

It'll sound more meaningful and sincere if you don't discuss your parents at the same time. \n\nTotally have a discussion another time about how you and your sister can get past the problems caused by your mother. But do that chat another day.",
