  "post content": "My partner and I (me 35NB and 60M) hosted a dinner party for some friends, let\u2019s called them \u201cMark\u201d (55M) and \u201cGertrude\u201d (45F). Gertrude is allergic to glutens so cooking for her has always been a bit of a challenge.\n\nI really didn\u2019t want to have a dinner party on a Wednesday because I am the gourmet cook in the household and people expect me to make gourmet food for them. I work late that day so the time I start cooking dinner, I am already exhausted.\n\nBut Mark and Gertrude insisted on coming ASAP. Because Gertrude is unemployed while Mark was recently laid off. I offered to refer him to my current employer who is hiring for multiple positions and Mark wants to see what\u2019s available.\n\nSo I ended my WfH day at 3:30 and began slow cooking oxtail stew. I mix my own source using fresh ingredients and a little bit of miso. For some reason - most probably tiredness - kept thinking miso is gluten free because it\u2019s made of soy, not wheat or corn.\n\nMy partner \u201cCasper\u201d offered me to help me do some cooking and when he saw the miso, told me that miso can have trace gluten in it and we can\u2019t serve the oxtail. By the time dinner had been stewing for over 1.5hrs and there was not enough time to make anything else. So we ordered sushi takeaway instead.\n\nWhen Gertrude and Mark arrived she was excited to smell the oxtail cooking on the stove, because that was her favourite. I apologised and explained the situation and offered sushi instead. Gertrude was quiet the whole evening and starred daggers at me.\n\nIt got worse because Casper and Mark are both socially inept and dug into the oxtail stew while commenting on how delicious it was. At that moment I really wanted to dig a hole in the ground and disappear.\n\nLater today I saw that Gertrude had made a passive-aggressive social media post calling me TA without actually naming me. Her words were something along the lines of \u201csome stupid asshole thought it was a good idea to add miso in a dish that never required miso for thousands of years just to feel smart. And now my dinner was ruined. SMH.\u201d\n\nThe comments were agreeing with her and there are other allergic people calling me an ignorant asshole. And I just feel really bad. I tried to do two nice things for Mark and ended up being called TA.\n\nSo AITA?",

I am nervous about cooking for celiacs because my allergies are like I eat all the gluten as it is fills in the stuff I can\u2019t and thus my kitchen isn\u2019t suitable plus as someone who gets a similar response as glutened to my intolerances (which are on top of the allergies) I am terrified of making someone feel that ill. \n\nI am a nightmare dinner guest as a lot of food likes to try to kill me and people are scared to cook for me as a professional.
