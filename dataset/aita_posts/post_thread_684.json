  "post content": "When I met my now ex he was in a shitty living situation with a lot of harassment and could barely pay his rent. I invited him to live with me (in his own room). I gave him a very fair rent (much less than his percentage cost) and told him that if something happened between me and him he would still be welcome as a roommate.\n\n\nLater he breaks up with me and starts spending a lot of time with his exgirlfriend. Since we wanted to be friends he came clean that he cheated on me with her for months. I decide I can still be his friend, we live together and I really do enjoy being his friend, but that I dont have any desire to be her friend. \n\n\nShe comes over sometimes and I'm civil. If I'm the first one to the door I let her in, I reply to her, I just don't initiate anything with her on my own. \n\n\nToday they came over while I was hanging out in the living room and I just kept doing what I was doing. They were bringing furniture in and I asked if I was in the way and moved when they said yes. \n\n\n5 minutes later he comes back out and tells me its unfair that I'm being so unwelcoming and rude to her. That its okay I dont want to be her friend but I cant be mean to her. I say that I dont think I'm being hostile, I'm just keeping to myself and letting them do whatever they want to do. He agrees I'm not being hostile but says I need to try harder to be friendly. I tell him that would be a lie, and I'm not going to, and that he's free to have her over however much he wants and do what he wants and I'll stay out of his way. I'll still be his friend when shes gone, but I dont want to hang out with her and I'm just going to keep to myself. \n\n\nHe says that sucks and he doesnt know if he could still be my friend anymore if I cant be friendly to her. I tell him yes it does suck, but it is what it is and I'm not willing to pretend anything other than what I feel, but I will stay out of their way when she's here. He reexpresses that I need to be more friendly or he'll stop being able to be my friend because its uncomfortable for him to feel like he's in the middle. I acknowledge that and say that I can't do anything more than what I'm doing now. \n\n\nThat's the backstory. \n\n\nSo. Where I'm stuck on is if I'd be TA is if he follows through with that and decides he cant be my friend anymore, would giving him 30 day notice of change of rent costs make me TA? \n\n\nRight now he pays well over $70 less per month just for his portion of rent+utilities. I also cover his grocery costs at no additional expense. I would not have offered this if he wasnt my friend. For a regular renter I would have calculated the costs by percentage, and given them their own shelves in cupbards and fridge so they would be responsible for their own food costs. \n\n\nHe doesn't bring in enough income to meet all of those expenses, which is why as his friend who makes more money than him, I have covered some. But if he's decided he cant be my friend anymore, am I still obligated to give him that price?",

Even the shittiest, most selfish people can be fun, charming, etc. They aren't all bad, or awful all the time, and its admirable that you try so hard to see the best in people and not hold grudges when you would be well justified in doing so. But you have to have standards for how you're treated and theres nothing wrong with having boundaries and insisting on being treated with respect. That doesn't make you shitty or catty. He doesn't have to be the worst person alive to justify you extricating yourself from an unfair situation or demanding better in your own goddamn home.\n\nWhat if, as a thought experiment, you imagined a friend or sibling you care about coming to you with this problem. What would you tell them? If they were a kind and successful person but didn't know many people in town, or were somewhat intertwined with their ex, would you assure them that whatever their ex demanded was something they should tolerate? Or would you tell them that they could do better and should stand up for themself? \n\nWhat if you imagined being him. You're in a jam and your partner helps you out, gives you a place to live for cheap, even covers your food and hooks you up with a job. Somehow you're ok with someone paying for your food and giving you a sweetheart deal on your rent because they're your partner... but then you cheat on him with your ex. Not once. Repeatedly over time. You keep taking advantage of the situation because it benefits you while actively betraying and disrespecting the person helping you. You come home, lie to his face, know that you're doing the wrong thing, but dont bother to make a change because this situation is fucking sweet! You have cheap rent, free food, a live in bang maid! \n\nThen you're comfortable enough to go ahead and end the relationship, confident that the gravy train will keep flowing as long as you stay \"friends\". You're still living in his place, paying reduced rent and eating his food, because taking the mature step and leaving wouldn't be the cheapest, easiest, most convenient thing for you. And why not? It's not like this arrangement impacts you negatively at all. You still get all the benefits and just expect that your ex will keep swallowing his pride in the name of \"friendship\". Why shouldn't he pay for your food, clean up after you,  pretend this is normal? You bring your boyfriend around the house, you both take up the space, eat your exes food, parade the relationship you had *behind his back* in front of his face *in his own home* under the expectation that you're friends now, so why should he take issue. He tolerates its, tries to see the best in you and ignore the rest. But no.. he isn't actively happy to see the man you cheated on him with in his house (**not** your house, you are a tenant). He doesn't go out of his way to welcome and adore your new bf. He doesn't do **every single thing** possible to help you to ignore what a selfish, inconsiderate leech you're being. So instead of reconsidering how unreasonable of a situation this is and changing it to preserve a friendship that you claim matters to you, you use that \"friendship\" as a bargaining chip to force your ex into not just tolerating your new bfs presence but actively pandering to him and being the doormat he is to you to him too. It's not enough that you pay less rent, dont pay for food, have your ex being cordial to you while constantly reminded on your cheating, he cant have any lingering feelings at all. He cant do what's right for him in his own home unless it is exactly what you want every step of the way. \n\nCan you imagine yourself doing any of those things? Can you imagine being that entitled, selfish, and demanding? Doing whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted, taking everything you can get and giving little to nothing back? Disregarding your \"friend\"'s feelings or needs because it's not the most convenient thing for you? Using his desire to maintain a relationship with you against him to deny him his own feelings  and your own shittiness? Of course you cant. Because you're a good person and a good friend. Maybe with some distance, he could be a decent friend but that's not what he is right now and you deserve not just more rent, but a better roommate. You can do this, OP, you get to set boundaries on how you're treated. instead of tying yourself up in knots trying to let him off the hook and blaming yourself, put your foot down and move forward. You can do better and you will once you put a stop to this.",
