  "post content": "I am 30. Since I was a child he has always said he would pay for my wedding. \n\nAbout 5 years ago he started a relationship with lady with quite extreme views. She is a vegan, which is fine but she is very judgemental to how I live. She doesn\u2019t agree with cancer scans (like smear tests, mammograms etc) because vegans \u201cdon\u2019t get cancer\u201d, when I had my daughter she said I should be feeding her almond milk. She once came to my house for dinner and I cooked a chicken for me and my family and a nut roast for my father and her. She later dug a hole in my garden to give the chicken bones a proper funeral because she was so \u201cheartbroken to see us eating it\u2019s blood and flesh\u201d.I wish I was joking.  \n\nShe has also accused me of trying to steal her fathers house. I have never met her father, I have never set foot in her fathers house. All I know is he died recently. I had communicated some cost of living worries to my dad (not asking for money) and she ran with it and said I was trying to manipulate her into giving me her inheritance. I do not want her inheritance. \n\nLong story short, my father will only pay for my wedding if it\u2019s vegan. This not only includes food, but shoes, alcohol, what other people wear (E.g. leather) and anything else you can think of. I might have been ok with vegan food, but I\u2019m not ok with policing what others wear or food they may bring for their babies (even formula) etc. \n\nThis has upset me. It\u2019s not really about the money, we are having a very small and cheap do anyway. In the run up to the wedding this woman has also been extremely rude to my mother. On reflection I have now decided it\u2019s best all round that they do not attend. \n\nShe\u2019s now telling my dad\u2019s side of the family that it\u2019s just about the money and that I am bitter because I didn\u2019t get her dad\u2019s house (Why on Earth would I be given her dads house?!) and that my dad isn\u2019t paying for my wedding, but to be honest it\u2019s not really about the money. I don\u2019t want to be controlled over what I can and can\u2019t do on my wedding day, I\u2019m sick of her judgement (and his, now she\u2019s gotten her claws into him) and I just think it will be better for me, my siblings and my mother if they do not come. I also don\u2019t want to be lectured over milk, dairy, honey, palm oil you name it, on my wedding day and I don\u2019t want to put my guests through it either. \n\nAITA?",

I had to scroll through so many damn comments on the actual post to get here, but needed to just to give you the upvote and say that this is such a good response and idea. Personally, someone replied saying they'd add in some passive aggressive parts. I kinda agree with them cause the main point of their add-on makes it so that the father has to confront the fact that he really did decide his gf and his gf's desire for him and everyone around to be vegan are more important to him than his own daughter's wedding or a relationship with her AND his granddaughter. That being said, your reply is to the point and very gracious (probably more gracious than he deserves), but it's absolutely perfect.\n\nAs far as OP goes, I think you should ask your brother to walk you down the aisle (if you haven't already come to another solution). If you two have a strong relationship, I think this solidifies it even more by showing that your family means more to you than a newer individual who is seemingly just trying to keep your father in her pocket instead of letting him live. And it sounds like you've tried to put up with her far more than your brother (not to discredit him at all, I'm sure he tried at first, just saying it sounds like you went above and beyond an extra chance or two or seven), so if you were brought to this point, it's probably very evident to those in your family that this lady's a loon.

I don't want to loose you dad, but I will not be manipulated by your GF and I refuse to deal with her narcissism during the wedding. Maybe you can both come to the wedding but if she creates 1 problem I will literally kick you out on the spot. Leave it on her to explode as she is likely to do considering all this narcissism and then kick both their asses out. If she makes a public fuss just have the mc do a joke and move on.
