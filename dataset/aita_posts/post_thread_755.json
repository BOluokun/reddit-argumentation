  "post content": "I (25m) am still friends with a lot of my friends from high school. I've been using facebook a lot more during COVID here in NYC to keep in touch with, and even reconnect with some friends. I'm commenting on more friends' posts, which also causes people to see my name, remember it from high school, and add me if we weren't already friends.  \n\n\nThat is what I thought happen with this one woman, C (24f). She was an underclassman in high school, one year my junior, and I literally don't remember hanging out with her. She want to my school, sure, and we have mutual friends, but we were never close. So when she added me, I was a little suspect, but she pretty much just added me and never messaged or interacted with me.  \n\n\nLooking through her facebook after she added me, it doesn't paint a pretty picture; she lost multiple relatives to the disease, including a parent who was financially supporting her. Her partner is some kind of disabled, but doesn't seem to receive government assistance, so C is basically supporting them, too. C works a really shitty, low-paying job, and doesn't seem to be able to make ends meet. Almost all of her posts are her asking for money, usually enumerating what bill is coming up that she needs help with. I'm sure it really sucks to be in her position. I haven't given, because while I'm financially secure now, my mother is ill and I anticipate having to financially support her very soon and need to save my money.  \n\n\nSince adding me, she's made no attempt to connect with me personally, no message asking how I am, or asking what I did since we went to school together, or posting about any shared interests. In fact the first direct interaction she made with me was a month after adding me, where she posted a reply to one of her posts asking for money with a meme and then tagged me and a few other people. I noticed she's started doing this more and more often, sometimes posting two or three memes and then tagging people she went to high school with. It's clear she's basically trying to get more visibility for her posts begging for money.  \n\n\nI was with my mother at the hospital and, admittedly, kind of annoyed, when I got a notification where she tagged me with another meme. And all I wrote was \"I would appreciate not being tagged in your posts if you don't have the basic decency to feign interest in my life before hitting me up for cash.\"  \n\n\nA lot of our mutual friends started messaging me saying that it was rude, that she's had a super hard time recently, that I didn't know what she went through. I pointed out I had no way of knowing what she'd gone through since she hadn't actually tried to reach out or contact me. I think there's definitely an etiquette to begging for money, as humbling as it is, and that I didn't appreciate just being added as a FB friend to widen her potential donor pool. I felt like I was being treated as a piggybank, rather than a person.",
