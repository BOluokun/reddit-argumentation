  "post content": "My sister [F 13] wants to go with me [F 15] to the library every Monday. I don't want her to come with me or to be there at all. \n\nEvery Monday after school I walk 20 minutes to the library and stay there for 2 hours. I usually work on homework then I write a story I've been working on. It peaceful and quiet there and I love it. \n\nNow my sister says that it's unfair that I go to the library and she has to ride the bus home. She wants to come with me and hang out with me for the whole 2 hours until our girl scouts meeting across the street at 5:30. I really don't think it's a good idea nor do I actually want here there.\n\nMy argument: she goes to a different school on the other side of town. She'd have to walk to the library by herself which I don't think my mom would like. If for some reason my mother allows it then there's no reason that she couldn't walk to the library an other day of the week when I'm not there trying to finish my homework. \n\nI always have people around me all the time because I'm involved in so many activities. Marching band, the play, youth group, girl scouts, ect. Sometimes it's nice to go to the library and not have to talk to anyone or pay attention to what they're doing. The library is like an escape for me. That's why I don't want her there. I'd have to talk to her if she got bored and I'd have to keep an eye on her. \n\nSister's argument: I just want to spend more time with my sister. She's always gone and doing stuff so what'll it hurt if I see her for 2 more extra hours? She never wants to be around me and she's never at home anymore. All I want is to go there and spend some time with her. I already went with her once for the last hour she was there and I didn't talk to her or disrupt her and she still got mad. \n\nAnd if I want to go to the library then I should be allowed to. I hardly get any service at home and we don't have high speed internet like the library does. Without my sister there I get creeped out by everyone there so I don't want to go by myself. I want to go with someone I know so I don't feel uncomfortable. \n\nMe again: so I really don't want her to go with me but my mother is starting to think that it'd be a good idea. Am I just being an A-hole or am I right?",

She should not be allowed to force you to hang out with her when you need alone time. If she doesn't want to go to the library and be by herself, she shouldn't go to the library. You're entitled to be alone when you need it.\n\nBut, you should also be considerate of the fact that she'd like to spend more time with you, and think about if there's a way to make that happen that'll make both of you happy. Because that's a nice thing. And maybe you'd be happier overall if you cut back a bit on all your activities that are filling your schedule so full. (Or you wouldn't be, I don't know, it's just a suggestion.)",
