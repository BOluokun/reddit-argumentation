Here\u2019s the thing, there\u2019s this one freshman who looks like he could barely pass for a 7th grader and he\u2019s pretty socially awkward. I dont know him well, but he comes off as an iPad kid. He saw me next to the hole in the ceiling and shouted out, \u201cHe\u2019s venting! He\u2019s sus!\u201d like an Among Us reference. Guys started laughing at him it he didn\u2019t seem to mind. Then, while we were waiting in the hallway, i thought it might be funny to joke around so I walked up, nudged him, and said \u201cGuess what? I\u2019m the impostor.\u201d I hoped everybody would have a chuckle, including him, but he just kind of walked back to the locker room looking dejected. I didn\u2019t mean to make him feel bad, but I know he does. Am i the asshole?",

You know he\u2019s awkward etc and you assumed that he didn\u2019t mind when he was laughed at. You\u2019re likely wrong. He probably did mind and then you dug it in further trying to joke around with him.\n\nit wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a chat with him, part of him being awkward could be coming from the fact that he looks like a 7th grader. Heck maybe he skipped a grade or two and should be a 7th grader and he feels weird. An older kid genuinely being nice to him might help. snd who knows that \u201cipad kid\u201d might actually be a cool dude.",

If you learn from this, you won't be an asshole at all.\n\nIn the future, you have to draw attention to the kid who is already confident and popular and strong. If you're going to make a joke that draws a bunch of attention to somebody, do it to somebody who can handle it. If someone is smaller than you, only ever lift them up. That's your job. If you are bigger than someone, you only help them. You can make fun of the kids that are bigger than you. I know you were not trying to be mean. But you were insensitive to the situation. This is called reading the room. Taking the time to imagine what it might be like to be another person. That's empathy, and it's an important skill. \n\nYou should apologize to the kid and let him know that you're sorry for drawing a bunch of attention to him. Then do something nice for his ass. Buy him a cookie, invite him to join you, or just include him and things in PE class. Be his buddy. He's small, he could use it. Plus you never know. Maybe one day he will be a lot bigger than you are and you will be very happy that you were his buddy when he was small.",
