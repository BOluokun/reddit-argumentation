  "post content": "My boyfriend has a female friend that I have never met for a series of real reasons and some of my own excuses. He is getting exasperated with me but I'm not sure how to tell him the truth as to why I don't want to meet  or whether I should just suck it up and give in.\n\nThe main issue I have is that she is a cocaine user who has children. The coke isn't the issue, I have used it socially in the past and have friends who still use sometimes. My issue is she is a single mother who uses several times a week in the house where her children are. She's either alone or with others also on coke. Basically no unintoxicated adults if anything happened. Sometimes there will be 8 or more coked up adults downstairs.  And she has an attitude of 'it's fine, kids are upstairs' etc. And because she's a single mum most of the times she suggests meeting require us going to her house, where there's a 50/50;chance drugs will be happening. It would feel strangely like enabling some thing I strongly disagree with just to be in the vicinity. Apart from that I don't really know how to go about meeting someone, where there is a pressure to get on all friendly, when I have so little respect for their actions.  \n\nAm I being stuck up and judgemental? I'm concerned that's how I am going to come across if I tell my boyfriend the truth as he seems nonplussed about the whole situation.",
