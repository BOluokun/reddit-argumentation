  "post content": "My three kids all have graduations this week.\n\nOne high school, one elementary and one preschool. \n\nMy high school son Liam said he has zero interest in going to his younger brothers' graduation because it's \"lame.\" I said his brothers are going to his and it's more work for them to go than for him to go to theirs.\n\nYesterday he said he's still not going. I said okay then you're not going on your senior trip to the Bahamas next week. He walked away without saying a word and went to his mom's. His mom then texted me about my being petty. I told her to mind her business. This has nothing to do with her. This is between our son and my other sons (half brothers to Liam).\n\nI texted him information about the graduations and haven't heard back. If he doesn't show up then I'll cancel his little school trip. He can go to his mom and she'll lie about how she doesn't have the money.",

Either A. he's going to go and be miserable and possibly make everyone else miserable or B. he's not gonna go, OP will cancel the trip and Liam will resent OP for years and their relationship will be strained.\n\nThe fact that Liam simply walked away at news like this, tells me that he half expected this temper tantrum that OP is throwing and that this is a typical reaction from OP. Based on that and his comments about his ex, Liam's mother, it seems to me that he prioritizes his new girlfriend/wife/relationship and their kids over Liam. \n\nI'd even go as far as to speculate that maybe, OP left Liam's mom for the mother of the younger boys, maybe even cheated on Liam's mom with her.

While I was treated like shit by my dad and stepmom and went no contact, I never felt that way about my half siblings. Our family was very poorly blended, I was just a burden my father was obligated to take care of and a reminder/punching bag to my stepmom, but my siblings were always just that: my siblings who I love.\n\nI was thinking about the younger half siblings feelings in my original comments. I do still think that going would be beneficial to them and that it'd be a positive memory for them to have their older siblings show up and support them, but I wasn't looking at OP's behavior as a whole or taking his tone into account. \n\nOP might \"win\" this battle, or he might lose it, but either way, this runs deeper than graduations. Is the kid entitled to a trip to the Bahamas? No, but I feel like either way, this relationship is going to turn no contact from whatever factors that have led up to this bitterness between them. This is less about this specific situation and more about how he's treating/talking about his eldest as a whole. These sorts of problems and attitudes don't develop overnight. I'm not even sure if this relationship can be repaired or if the oldest kid is going to bolt the moment he can.\n\nDo I think older bro should go and support his younger siblings? Yes, they likely don't understand why older bro and dad don't get along and want their sibling to celebrate with them. I would like to think that they at least should feel supported and loved by their older brother and that big bro cares. But I can see why he might not want to now that it's \"non negotiable\"\n\nBut in the bigger picture, OP probably has been treating his eldest this way for a while, and now that eldest kid is an adult, graduated, and on the edge of Independence, he's putting his foot down and done playing games or having things dangled over him. It's very much a possibility that he does love his younger half siblings, but he's making a point that he's no longer going to be forced to do things. Abusive parents can love bomb and give gifts one day and be absolutely vile the next. \n\nWithout his kid to chime in his side or knowing how OP's family functions from a neutral POV, this post is pretty biased against the son to paint him as an entitled brat and I failed to read between the lines. \nI'm sure my own abusive parents would paint me in a poor light as well and call me undeserving and ungrateful if they were asked.\n\nFor that, OP is the AH.",
