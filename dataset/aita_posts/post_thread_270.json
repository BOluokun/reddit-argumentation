  "post content": "AITA For unpacking my girlfriend\u2019s towel. \n\nI (31M) and my gf (25F) have been dating for about 2 years. \n\nMy GF has beautiful hair that seems a lot more low maintenance than most women I know. She doesn\u2019t use all a hundred different hair products, nor does she blow dry it. It honestly doesn\u2019t take her long to style her hair or anything. However, she always insist on using this special towel to dry her hair. \n\nShe insists that she can\u2019t use any regular towel for her hair. She gets mad if I use her hair towel as a regular towel too. She says that the towel should only be used for hair. She even bought an extra one of these towels that she keeps in her drawer at my place. She also takes the towel with her when she goes on vacation. \n\nI usually don\u2019t mind it, since the towel doesn\u2019t take up much space, and it better than listening to a hair dryer all the time. But it\u2019s a bit weird because I don\u2019t know anyone else who has a towel just for their hair. \n\nFor Thanksgiving, we travelled to see my family. Before the trip, I asked my GF to leave her towel at home since we\u2019ll be staying at my parents\u2019 house. I didn\u2019t want my family to think she was weird or make fun of her. \n\nSince we planned to leave early in the morning, GF spent the night at my place. I noticed that she packed the towel she kept at my place in her suitcase. When she was asleep, I took the towel out. She didn\u2019t notice the towel was gone until after we got to my parent\u2019s house. \n\nI thought it was okay, and my GF didn\u2019t seem mad at all during the whole trip. However, when we got back at my place, my GF got into her car and drove off without saying goodbye. She texted me later saying she\u2019s mad at me because of that stupid towel and she needs some space. I keep calling and texting her, but she won\u2019t respond. \n\nMy friends think she\u2019s being overly dramatic, but my GF isn\u2019t that type of person. Now I\u2019m wondering if I messed up.

Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.\u201d\n\nEdit:  WOW! Was not expecting this much love. So many awards! Thank you!! \nSpecial thanks to the OP for being such an AH and inspiring this outstanding thread.  \nLesson learned: Don\u2019t fuck with someone else\u2019s towel.",

He ran his own experiment on his girlfriend to measure whether or not she would be aware of the towel's absence. Well shit, he may as well have removed her toothbrush along with it!\n\nI own two towels just like what was described ([here](https://volobeauty.com/products/volo-quick-dry-towel) ). Why a separate towel for my hair than my body? The reason being is that regular towels are too rough on the hair surface and texture. This results in hair frizzing and causing breakage. \n\nAnyone who goes so far as to shame another person for how they care about their appearance is stooping pretty low.",
