  "post content": "My boyfriend (29M) and I (22F) recently decided to move in together. We\u2019ve been together for 1.5 years. I am currently renting an apartment and he has a house that he bought just before we started dating.\n\nBefore moving in together, we thought it\u2019d be best to discuss finances. He\u2019s a doctor and I\u2019m a social media manager. He told me how much he makes and it was more or less what I expected. When I told him how much I make, he kind of laughed and said I\u2019m supposed to tell him how much I make per month, not per year. I told him no, that\u2019s how much I make per month. His shock was understandable to me- I make 150% of his salary.\n\nI told him that it\u2019s just because I work for a client in a country where the currency is nearly 20x stronger. If I had this same job in our country, I would only make a quarter of what he does.\n\nI don\u2019t live an extravagant lifestyle so you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that I make as much money as I do by just looking at me. I still live in a small apartment that I got when I was making less than 20% of what I make now, and I never learned how to drive (I know, I know) so I don\u2019t have a car and get around exclusively by e-hailing services.\n\nOnce the initial shock wore off, he said that\u2019s great, because now I can pay half of his mortgage. \n\nI was a little taken aback by that. I mean, it\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t going to contribute to the household at all. I would\u2019ve been happy to buy groceries, pay utilities and cook and clean because my workload is MUCH lighter than his. I told him this and that I wouldn\u2019t pay half his mortgage.\n\nHe retorted that since I make so much more than him that the least I could do is pay just half the mortgage and that we could go half on groceries and utilities.\n\nI told him that that\u2019s a little unfair because if we break up, he gets a house and I\u2019m left with nothing, and that if that\u2019s going to be the case I would rather stay in my apartment.\n\nI offered up a compromise. His house is sparsely decorated to say the least. He has 2x 1 seat couches, a table that\u2019s too big and a tv that\u2019s too small. Oh, and a bed. He\u2019s never really there, so I get it. I told him that I would furnish the entire house and get the groceries, cook and clean, and we\u2019d go half on utilities. But he still insisted that I pay half of the mortgage.\n\nHe said that I still need a place to live, and that if I was going to be paying rent anyway, paying his mortgage would be the same thing. He said I\u2019m being an A-hole for not wanting to pay it.\n\nMy boyfriend is a smart man so I don\u2019t know if he doesn\u2019t see the logic (or lack thereof in my opinion) of what he\u2019s saying or if I\u2019m being dumb and it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nAITA for not wanting to pay half of my boyfriend\u2019s mortgage?\n\nNote: I would\u2019ve been happy to pay half of his rent. It\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about the principle.\n\nEdit 1: I will come back to add more information when I have some time, but for now I will say that half the mortgage he wants me to pay is 3x my current rent.",

And, spoilers, she still gets a place to live in exchange for payment.\n\nWhen people say mortgage payment they usually mean escrow. Property tax is hundreds plus every month, insurance, and THEN the mortgage payment. Which, early on, pretty much only hits interest and not the principal. So, no, you don't just get the money back. You also lose 7% of the value paying both realtors when you sell. So, you can actually sell a house and have to write a check. People can literally be too poor to sell their homes.\n\nI don't think alot of these comments even understand the basic math behind renting or owning. The system we have currently is baaadd. That doesn't mean you should stiff your home owning partner because you don't understand how mortgages work. And, even if they do get some of that money back. Who. Cares. You lived there! Likely for much less than rent on your own. And, if YOURE so sure about the relationship, like you expect the home owner to be, who cares it'll be both your equity in the future.\n\nEntitlement and ignorance is off the fucking charts with some of you. The commenter below even says they don't pay rent! It's ridiculous af. Mommy and daddy paid your bills, and now you want wifey/hubby to.\n\nEdit; I'm well aware they said 3x. Without actual numbers that's meaningless. If you live in your mom's basement for 5 and want to move in with someone in an apartment that is 1,000. You don't get to go \"but that's more... :-(\". OP intentionally left that info out. They might be in a 200sqft apartment versus a 1800 sqft house with a third of an acre. We don't know, because she didn't share it.

The rent of a comparable place is not what she wants or she would have moved. \n\nI see this all the time in this sub - \u201cyou pay rent on a place you don\u2019t own so why wouldn\u2019t you pay \u201crent\u201d in a house your partner owns?\u201d  Well, a) because you are romantic partners, not landlord/tenants. B) because 90% of the time the partner who owns the home choses everything about it - it is what they want, in the area they want, what\u2019s in it, and you are just along for the ride\u2026until you break up. Much less stable than a lease; much less convenient than where you live already; and much harder to argue with your partner about upgrades and fixes than your landlord you don\u2019t sleep with every night. And c) because often the mortgage is more than what they are paying in rent elsewhere.

My husband moved from a rent controlled \u201cjunior 1 bedroom\u201d in the city to my 3 bedroom house in the suburbs. Half my mortgage would for sure be less than what he *would have paid* to rent a 3 bedroom house, BUT HE DIDNT WANT A 3 BEDROOM HOUSE. Why would he pay 1/2 of more house than he needed?  It would also be more than he was paying for his apartment, and it shouldn\u2019t cost HIM MORE while costing ME LESS to live in a place he didn\u2019t choose. Also at the time, his commute doubled moving in with me (so gas and bridge toll and time) - he would NEVER have *chosen* to live in the suburbs, but that was kind of a condition of moving in to my house, which again, seemed like a real dick move to add even more cost to his budget for the privilege of sharing a room with me in the inconvenient location of my choosing. \n\nHe actually offered to pay his former rent price to me, but i figured out that the costs of half the utilities for renting a drafty old house, plus groceries (I have more expensive tastes than him), and my cable package, and his new transportation costs was basically the same as his old monthly payments, and that was surely enough of a contribution. OP is NTA. There\u2019s no upside for her in any of this, and it actually kind of seems like \u201cpunishment\u201d for her making more.",

It's not even generally the best asset you could get for the money (although since you can buy it with leverage and some countries give tax breaks that offsets things a bit.) One way or another you're paying rent (keep in mind you could \\*both\\* move out of the apartment and rent it to someone else.) \n\nSo there is no principle to stand on here. OP and her BF should decide on what financial arrangement makes them comfortable with the move in or if they can't find one don't move in. It's reasonable for her to pay something for rent, but there's not necessarily any reason it should be market rate if she wouldn't have wanted to pay market rate absent the BF's decision to live there. There is ultimately no principled correct way to split the costs, it's simply a joint decision to navigate. I will say that if you guys can't find a way to navigate this, which is a relatively simple financial situation, in a way that makes you both happy that's not a good sign for the long-term.\n\nNAH (but again wrong on the matter of principle)",
