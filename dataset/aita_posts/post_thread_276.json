  "post content": "Let me just preface this by saying this: **I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS.** Now that the air is clear, let me continue. \n\nMy daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as \"liberal\", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.\n\nMy parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.\n\nAs I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.\n\nAnna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.\n\nNo advice needed, but I have to know. Have I been an ass?",

Anti racism isn't popular in \"the community\" when you define that as white people of a certain age and class. It never has been and never will be. Dr King's dream wasn't to ask politely for people to be \"not exactly liberal but okay\", then give up and abandon black people and their white partners to the wolves if they say no.\n\n> furious at both her *and* me\n\n[edit: This is ultimately an avoidant desire.] You and the other white moderates are the jewel in their crown; they need to win your complicity before they expand their empire. You are the oil in their tanks; your [edit: uncivil adjective] actions fuel their advance. Do \"your daughter\" a favor and tell her you've chosen not to be a dad to her because it might affect your little popularity contest. She deserves to know the truth. Jamal deserves to know you place your little neighborhood pecking order above his safety and freedom, too.\n\nLet's hear from Dr. King about the white moderate:\n\nLetter from Birmingham Jail (excerpt)\n\nBy Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., 16 April 1963\n\n\"First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;\" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a \"more convenient season.\"\n\nShallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\"\n\nYou're not just \"not liberal\", OP. You are the enemy of [edit: antiracists]. [edit: uncivil suggestion.] Be a [edit: swearing should probably go too, given the tone] DAD. Get your [attitude] together before you get someone seriously hurt with your wishy-washy bull[crap]. Be part of the solution or get out of the way. And might I add, your parents are who Dr. King meant by \"White Citizen's Council-er\". How many black people did they attack at soda fountains and city halls? How many have they intimidated out of their neighborhood? Have you even asked? Ball's in your court, [TAH].",

I'm white, live in a predominantly white area, I have black coworkers, and a couple black friends.\n\n\nMy black friends both think like you do but I've had black coworkers that don't feel the same way and feel like a level of familiarity is required before using \"black\". One coworker was actually clearly uncomfortable with the conversation. It was a group convo that was curious in nature but this was the first experience I had that I realized that no one person can represent a group. Given the right circumstances some people will even be uncomfortable by the questions. This made me completely rethink the way I broached topics of race. \n\n\nI was, likely still am, the naive whiteboi who thought/thinks that just talking openly about race can solve problems and show those people around me that I'm an ally.
