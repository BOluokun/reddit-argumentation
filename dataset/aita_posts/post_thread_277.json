  "post content": "I (24 F) got engaged to Derrick (30 M) one month ago. Prior to that, we had known each other for six months. I know that\u2019s not a long time, but when you know, you know. We are madly in love and ready to commit ourselves to each other fully. \n\nMy sister (26 F) has a problem with that though. She was supportive of my relationship with Derrick before we got engaged. When I sent her a text telling her we were engaged, she responded by saying \u201ccongratulations.\u201d But then when I saw her the week after that, she got all serious and said I should strongly consider the marriage. \n\nShe told me I was young and could meet people I loved more. That was offensive to me because I love Derrick more than anything, and she\u2019s basically saying my love isn\u2019t that important. She also told me that Derrick and I could date for longer before we got married. But we are already fully committed to each other, so we might as well get married and be recognized as soul mates in the eyes of the law. \n\nAnyway, the conversation was so hurtful to me. I eventually asked her, very directly, \u201cdo you support me marrying Derrick?\u201d She said no. So I stood up, told her she shouldn\u2019t be at the wedding if she didn\u2019t want us to get married, and left. I haven\u2019t talked to her since, although she has texted me multiple times asking to talk. \n\nDerrick and I were working on the wedding guest list yesterday, and we both agreed my sister should not come if she doesn\u2019t support us. So we are planning not to invite her. I mentioned this to my friend yesterday, and she pointed out that it may be a little rude of me not to invite her. So, AITA for not inviting my unsupportive sister to my wedding?",

It\u2019s because this initial phase of excitement doesn\u2019t last. It is brief.  Chemicals such as dopamine and oxytocin are released in your brain stimulating euphoria and mimicking love. This is why most people stress that it\u2019s better to wait to get to know the other person longer before you make a life long commitment. Your sister sounds mature and sensible and concerned about you as a loving sister should.  The fact that your six month old boyfriend thinks it\u2019s ok for you to cut contact with her over this is not only horrifying but extremely concerning.   \n\nYTA",

If you love and respect them for who they are, you need to give them the room to really experience who you are--and frankly, damn-near-nobody ever truly revealed themselves to someone else inside the first year. You can learn a lot! But so much of the time, you can't learn enough. You don't even know who this person is in all seasons (are they a pissy-in-the-summer polar bear? Do they get Seasonal Affective Disorder in the wintertime?) and you haven't been with them long enough to have a real disagreement or see them under real stress.\n\nAnd they haven't had that for you.\n\nI don't think real love should take shortcuts, because that's an easy way to hurt your partner later. As long as nobody's dying and there's no \"my visa runs out in a month\" sort of outside pressure, there's no reason to marry yet.",

          "content": "Thank you for saying this. \n\nMy sister went through a similar path. She started dating someone right after the pandemic began, in March 2020. It was a long distance relationship as he lived in another state but would regularly visit friends in our area, about once a month or so. She was 29, he was 38. \n\nMy sister fell hard. This was her first real relationship. The first time they went on an actual date (she asked me to come along) she had me take a picture of them. Then they facetimed our parents and introduced him to our mom and dad. He chose not to talk to me most of the time, so I gave them their space. After we left, she posted the picture to social media with heart emojis. Then she got mad at me and said I wasn\u2019t nice to him. I\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t a fan of his. \n\nWhen she went to his city to visit him the first time, she went alone. The second time, she invited her friend, and asked if I could go watch her dog. When I got upset and said I would help pay for any hotel or Airbnb, she said she didn\u2019t want me to go because I would embarrass her in front of his mom (who he lived with at the time). \n\nWhenever we were hanging out in person, he wouldn\u2019t engage me in conversation. He would only speak directly with my sister. \n\nThere were many other things that happened. Personality things, opinions he voiced, etc that made me hesitant about him, but then my sister told me they weren\u2019t going to have kids. My sister has always loved children. Kids have always flocked to her and she has always had a strong maternal instinct. When she was younger and helped plan baby showers for friends, she would tell me exactly what kind of theme she wanted for her baby shower, what names she had already picked out, etc. But now, a major life goal she had is thrown away because he doesn\u2019t like kids. \n\nI had my reservations before, but from that point, I refused to speak to her about him. If she was talking to him on the phone, I would go to my room. I told her about the red flags, I asked what her reasoning would be, there were many conversations. She would always go back me being unfair to him. I wasn\u2019t giving him a chance. I needed to be nicer to him. \n\nThen in January of 2021, 10 months after they began dating, 90% long distance, he proposed. He had called my parents beforehand, asked for their blessing, said he wanted me there. When I explained I had reservations about his plans (wanting to go to a restaurant at the height of the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available\u2014restaurants were also supposed to be closed in our state because of the pandemic so it being open was illegal.) I was disinvited from the proposal. I found out when my sister got ready for the dinner the day of. \n\nSo they\u2019re engaged, and when my sister mentions the date, it\u2019s a little over two months away, at the beginning of April. Just a few days after a year of dating. They knew before he had proposed they wanted that date\u2014for what reason? She still hasn\u2019t told me. \n\nMy sister was also going to be moving to the city he lived in. A city that she had previously said she hated. A city that she had no friends, no family, no job prospects. She had just landed a job that was full time and provided medical benefits, and she liked the work, and she was giving that all up. \n\nI begged her the day she left to rethink. To just slow down. I asked her where the rush was. They\u2019re not planning on having kids, so there\u2019s no rush for a biological clock. WHERE WAS THE RUSH?? She said something similar to OP, they were \u201cin love and wanted to be together.\u201d \n\nThey will be celebrating their 2nd anniversary this year. My sister isn\u2019t happy, that much is clear to anyone from the outside, but she won\u2019t admit that it\u2019s because of him or her rushing into a relationship. She said it\u2019s all of the other factors. The friends who don\u2019t call or text her anymore. People in the community who judge them (she\u2019s white, he\u2019s black, so everyone must be racist to not be happy for them). I have had my relationship with my sister permanently altered. My sister was my best friend and now I generally only text her if there\u2019s a family update about my parents. I won\u2019t call or FaceTime because then she tries to have me speak with her husband. \n\nI wasn\u2019t unsupportive of their relationship. I encouraged her to get to know him better, take a little more time to grow into their relationship. I was trying to be supportive of my sister, but because I wasn\u2019t explicitly supportive of the relationship and of HIM, I became the enemy.",
