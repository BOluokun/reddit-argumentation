  "post content": "My (16F) friend (16F) got really into tiktok when the pandemic started and kind of fell down the rabbit hole of people who have (or are pretending to have) dissociative personality disorder. She made a tiktok where she pretended to have it and it got kind of popular in that community.\n\nAt first it was kind of a joke but then she started getting really into it. Now it's all she talks about. I stopped hanging out with her a couple months ago because I would ask that we talk about something else and she'd have someone else from her \"system\" come out and threaten me. She also started making tiktoks about how her best friend wasn't supporting her, which really pissed me off.\n\nYesterday her mom came to talk to me and ask what was going on since she's acting so weird and we weren't hanging out anymore. We've been friends since we were kids. So I told her that I didn't like hanging out with her anymore because of the fake DID and showed her the tiktok, including the videos where she was talking about me. Her mom thanked me and told me she'd talk to her.\n\nA couple hours later she messaged me saying that I was an asshole and that her mom banned her from tiktok and I was ruining her life. I didn't respond but she sent a bunch of people to send me messages on tiktok and discord to say I was awful, too.\n\nI feel bad that her mom banned her from tiktok but I don't feel like I owe her anything anymore, honestly.",

I've seen how those types can really mindfuck someone who is vulnerable to manipulation. \n\nAnd, absolutely, faking disorders is terrible. I guess, in my experience, faking DID a pretty normal horrible teenage type behavior. At the very least, i saw enough people who faked it off and on beginning in middle school. That behavior is still wrong and needs to be corrected, but in my experience it's one of the horrible phases some kids go through. (None of this should be construed to be commentary on whether DID is real. People with DID suffered greatly and have a terribly difficult to manage condition.)",

      "content": "NTA.\n\nDID on tiktok is becoming an incredibly popular thing and it makes me sick. Not only is it an extremely rare disorder, it's one that stems from EXTREME trauma. It seems like a lot of younger people on tiktok think it's a cool thing to use to essentially LARP as their favorite characters. Not saying your friend did this, of course, just that it's very common. Back when I was in middle school, my best friend suddenly 'developed' DID in order to escape consequences (eg: he would kick you in the shin and when you got mad at him, he'd go 'oh that was my other personality, Bloodlust \\[yes really\\], so you can't be mad at me').\n\nYou did the right thing. Were she to actually have it, her mother should definitely know. And I think it's best that she be banned from using tiktok for now, anyway. Not to sound like a boomer at 19, but tiktok is genuinely pretty fucking bad for young and impressionable people.\n\n**edit: just wanted to talk a little more on this since it's getting attention, you don't have to read. having just finished it, its actually very long. sorry for writing a whole essay. im passionate abt this stuff**\n\nI do know people who actually have diagnosed DID. And I know a LOT more people that fake it. Calling out someone who is faking is very tough, because it is often very hard to tell and you would not want to fakeclaim someone who does actually have it. But I moderate a discord server for a game with 11,000 people, most of whom are about 13-16, most of whom are introverted and neurodivergent. A few of them are genuine systems. But we've had a disturbing amount of people faking it.\n\nI suppose I can't blame them all too much. They're kids. With TikTok making DID seem like a fun quirky mental illness, they're being very quick to jump on the trend. Way too many kids view TikTok as the end all know all for a bunch of important information. And it can be a legitimate source of information, but everything needs to be taken with a grain of salt, and it is extremely easy to end up in echo chambers.\n\nDID isn't evil like media makes it seem. And it's not a horrible, life crippling illness to have, if you seek the proper help you need and learn how to live with it. But it is not anything someone should want to have. I can not say that I know anyone with genuine diagnosed DID that is happy about having it. *There may be people like this*, I am just saying I do not know any. It is something that develops from an incredibly traumatic experience in order to help the victim cope, creating multiple personalities so that it feels like the trauma they are going through is not happening to them, but someone else. It's escapism in it's highest form.\n\nTikTok DID people (the non genuine ones, of course) are doing actual, very real damage to the image of people who are diagnosed with it. By twisting the idea of what DID is, and what it's like, it gives a lot of people false premonitions. And this will go on to affect how people treat the ones who genuinely have DID.\n\nPeople with DID are not cursed because of their illness, nor are they blessed. They are just people who function differently than the average person.\n\nThere is a way that these things happen. Not just with DID, but with anyone that isn't 'normal' by society's standards (excluding the obviously fucked up people, like pedos and other disgusting shit). They are outcasted, told to find their own space, because they don't belong. So, they create their own space to connect with each other. They talk about shared experiences and crack jokes to each other. And then the outsiders see this and feel that they are being left out of a fun, close knit community. And they want in. And that's how these situations are created.\n\nTikTok can be a fun way to interact with people like you. You can find communities of people like yourself, and it can make you feel less alone in the world. And you will also see other communities that seem like fun. But not all of them are for you. And everyone has to remember this.  (this is an example and is not directed at OP)\n\nTLDR: Those who fake DID in an attempt at belonging in a community that is not meant for them do very real damage to those who genuinely have DID, and warp the expectations that people have for systems. And I'm sure your friend isn't a bad person, OP. Just young, like you, and too impressionable for her own good. Getting her off TikTok is removing her from an echo chamber. And it is good that you stopped it now instead of letting it continue further.\n\nsorry for going off on a massive tangent. my meds kicked in lmao",
