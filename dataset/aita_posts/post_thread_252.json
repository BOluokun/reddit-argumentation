  "post content": "\n\nMy wife is a grade A+ picky eater. It's bothersome to a certain degree but on holidays basically the shitshow begins. She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them.\n\n\nAs a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event.\n\nShe started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the \"perfect compromise\".\n\n\nUpdate: And so, my wife has decided to go spend thankgiving with her family (who by the way live HOURS away, so this means unnecesary travel expenses) instead and basically ditch me for a whole week. Y'all happy now? Though I appreciate some insightful comments on the situation. Some others?.....not so much especially with those assumptions claiming that my wife has allergies, SHE DOES NOT! Y'all get that from? But anyway. S'all good now I guess though I'm not too thrilled with her decision. I feel like she's doing it to spite me or get me to cave in.",

Before his vegan ism, I don't think I had ever made a single food item without an animal product. I spent hours researching vegan food for Thanksgiving. I made additions and adaptations to our menu. We did hummus in addition to cheese dip. I did a portion of asparagus without bacon and some potatoes with oil instead of butter. I added Brussel sprouts. He was flattered and slightly teenage boy embarrassed I was being *that Aunt* and many times offered to just bring his own food. Hell no child. Aunty's house is where you come to get spoiled. Here's your plate of veg and there's more if you want seconds.\n\nOP, your wife should feel loved and respected at her MIL's and instead you made her feel marginalized and unwanted.  YTA\n\nEdit: This blew up and thank you all. These are my partner's twin niece and nephew who I met when they were 15. They're great kids (and now great young adults). I remember feeling out of place at family events, like I had to put on a facade, and I want them to always feel the love at my house. I am loving all the vegan suggestions.\n\nEdit 2: For those getting upset by me saying he's \"diet-misguided\", you need to relax. It's a joke between us and we have a very healthy relationship. We tease. One year he got me a stick of butter ornament for Christmas. A few years ago he brought \"NOT A VEGAN PRODUCT\" labels to Thanksgiving and stuck them on everything, including family members and pets. It's become a running joke but it doesn't show any less love and acceptance.",

For years afterwards, no matter what holiday it was that my mom hosted, she would continue to put onions in everything.  Being a college student, I still technically lived at home and would be there before these get together, reminding her as she cooked about my new sensitivity, thinking I just needed one or two items i could  eat. (For those wondering, if I ate onion, I would just throw up.  Didn\u2019t matter how small, cooked or raw.  Nothing would stay down.).  Then we\u2019d all sit down with all the family all passing around the dishes and everything still had onions.  When others noticed and asked, she\u2019d just say \u201cI forgot.\u201d   It wasn\u2019t until my uncle came down with a similar sensitivity that she started separation a bowl of whatever she was making and then adding onion as the final step in preparation.  So there was a Lorri and Uncle Paul option for a few big dishes.  We got there, but it took several years and several meals where I\u2019d eat off the cheese platter or make myself a sandwich.

It depends on the situation if MIL was expecting her to sample everything or if she planned dishes she knew his wife did not like.\n\nPart of being a host is trying to accommodate everyone\u2019s needs as much as possible. Like we saw in another post, it would be rude to demand MIL to make a separate meal or entree when cooking that holiday is stressful enough, but she should be considering sides and dishes that everyone can eat most of. I wouldn\u2019t do a main dish that people loathed unless I had another option or if the person who loathed it offered to bring something else.\n\nI\u2019m sure part of this dialog is feeling like their food isn\u2019t good enough for wife\u2026and they interpret it as making a scene with something else instead of interpreting it as being gracious and that you didn\u2019t want to inconvenience the host with additional dishes. I think it really comes down to interpretation based on other feelings. If you think the best in someone, it wouldn\u2019t be interpreted as negatively.\n\nI think the best option (IMO), is wife eating her meal on the way there\u2026.then taking little servings of what she can tolerate. If they hassle her over her quantity or lack of variety, then it\u2019s on OP to defend and shut it down.\n\nI get a little anxious over other family\u2019s dinners that I\u2019m not going to like enough or come across rude to the host if I don\u2019t eat enough.

Even when I try food and I so I  know it tastes good, I still can\u2019t eat it because for me it\u2019s less about the taste and more about the texture of the foods.\n\nAs a child, whenever I\u2019ve had family get-togethers, my parents would make and bring food for me separately. As an adult now, I do the same thing. When I go to friends houses, I\u2019ll bring my own food. Even when they\u2019re inviting me to their parents\u2019 houses, I bring my own food and no one gets offended. They might offer for me to try their foods at first, but once I explain it to them, no once takes it personally. Even when I go to restaurants with friends or family, where they typically have rules about bringing outside food, when I explain this to the staff, most times they\u2019ll allow me to eat my own food.\n\nIf OP\u2019s mother is seriously going to be offended about OP\u2019s wife bringing her own food food so she can feel better, then OP\u2019s mother has a problem and OP is enabling that problem by not supporting his wife on such a trivial issue. \n\nOP\u2019s wife did come up with the \u201cperfect compromise\u201d.

He already told her not to come to thanksgiving with him, and that she should stay home. So she isn\u2019t abandoning him because he had already decided to abandon her. Also I don\u2019t see how she\u2019d be doing \u201cunnecessary travel expenses\u201d since he\u2019s the one who told she shouldn\u2019t go. Like does he really expect her to just stay at home and wait on him to return when she has family a couple hours away that she can stay with. OP just seems really petty rn. And then to ask everyone here, if we\u2019re happy now that she\u2019s not spending thanksgiving with him and his family, as if we actually had anything to do with that. All that\u2019s on him and he needs to realize that and making it seem like everyone\u2019s out to get him.",

First, you don't explain why your wife is a \"picky eater\" and I suspect it's not because she just doesn't like stuff but that there are issues with certain foods. My wife has numerous issues that make regular meals a problem. For example, she can't have ordinary black pepper. It took me 15+ years to get my mom to fully realize how complex my wife's dietary restrictions are. Bringing food is a perfectly acceptable alternative these days. If your mom can't support that and can't support making something that your wife can eat, then neither of you should go.\n\nSecond, you're siding with your mom over your wife. Did you exchange marriage vows with your mom too? Is that why you won't support and defend the person you supposedly chose to build a life with? Keep doing that and you won't have a wife anymore.

I'll also ask her if she's found any new recipes that I can add to the meal for everyone else to try (her recipe for lamb meatballs, kale, and barley is killer).\n\nFor me, I love all kinds of foods and enjoy trying new things. That said, I have one thing I refuse to eat, hell or high water: beans. I hate them. The texture, the taste, the look, everything. It's the only thing I won't even try if I know it's in a dish and I will go hungry over eating. My family knows this and my mom believes it stems from surviving on beans and hot dogs as a child (thank you WIC).

He actually was surprised at how good his mango habanero chili was without beans (we used ground beef, ground turkey, and bison).\n\nBasically, we love each other and want to ENJOY meals together.
