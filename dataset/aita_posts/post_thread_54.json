  "post content": "I (F32) have been trying to get pregnant for seven years now and have been unsuccessful. Diagnosed with PCOS later in life, I\u2019ve had five miscarriages that have taken a massive toll on my physical and mental health. It has left me feeling like a massive failure as my partner (M36) desperately wants children and I\u2019m unable to give him this. He never makes me feel badly about it, but I know he\u2019s upset. His parents are in ill health and they want grandchildren more than anything.\n \nRecently, I had a massive argument with my sister (F34) after my last miscarriage. I was upset and asking her why this kept happening to me. She shrugged and said it was probably to do with the abortion I had when I was 19. Honestly, I was gobsmacked at how nonchalant she sounded. She knew there had been health reasons behind it and had been supportive at the time. I\u2019d been so poorly that I\u2019d needed an operation and had spent months recovering. Also, she knows how guilty I felt that I was unable to carry to full term.\n \nI asked her what she had meant and she said that our decisions always come back to haunt us and that I needed to understand that I\u2019d brought it on myself. That some people just weren\u2019t meant to have children and it was god\u2019s way of telling us to stop. She wasn\u2019t being mean, just blunt but my hormones were all over the place and I ended up kicking her out of my house and telling her not to contact me again. Soon after, I got loads of phone calls from my other sister, mum and dad and even my sister\u2019s husband basically saying I had overreacted and was being an a**hole. That I had to make things right and apologise. I refused and haven\u2019t spoken to any of them since.\n \nMy partner doesn\u2019t want her back in our house anytime soon after what she said. AITA for agreeing with him over my family?",

I can relate to you, OP.\n\nMy sister told me that I was the reason my stepkid had mental illness. I can't have kids, and she told me the world was better off not having, \"more psychos like me.\" Man, coming from someone who was going off, screaming at the top of her lungs, it was pretty rich and hypocritical. I'm NC with her now. She sends me junk \"presents\" that are pretty much just things she doesn't want or can't use. She cries to her friends like the things she said never happened, and wonders why, \"we can't just be friends like we used to.\" She has made it a point to make my life hell ever since I left for college over a decade ago, destroyed every friendship I had by lying her ass off (guess who everyone believed instead of asking me.) When she said that about my stepkids/fertility, though, that crossed a line. She can sob herself to sleep knowing she brought this on herself, no matter how she tries to twist the story to make herself the victim.\n\nActions have fucking consequences. Saying something that cruel to someone is an action, not just an afterthought. Tell your parents/family, \"Sure! I'll definitely apologize for her saying I deserved my miscarriages. Here, let me apologize to you too! I am *sooooo sorry* that I thought maybe my miscarriages were from health reasons, instead of divine punishment for not wanting to die at 19! Please, how should I atone?? You guys clearly have more wisdom than me, to know how horribly evil I am to 'deserve' this without even hearing my side of the story.\"\n\nGranted perhaps a bit dramatic. When my family told me my sister was upset, I told them point blank she can go fuck herself, and anyone who supports her blaming me for a kid's mental illness (THAT IS GENETIC, so MAN I am fucking MAGICAL to somehow have given him autism and O.D.D. WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING GENES) can go fuck themselves too. \n\nIf your family is anything like mine though, I am sure you just, \"brought this on yourself with your mindset, and shouldn't be so negative.\" (That's what my brother said when I told him I had an allergic reaction to anesthesia during surgery. Technically, \"It's scientifically proven people give themselves allergic reactions, so you shouldn't have gone into surgery thinking like that.\" People gaslighting others' medical issues is so fucked.)\n\nLong story short, you're both better off without her in your life. You're NTA, OP, but you will be, if you don't do the most basic thing to keep such horrible people out of your life. Trust me when I say, that even though I am a total stranger, you will breathe SO MUCH EASIER once you're not constantly having to deal with their shit. If your family hears your side of the story and still play favorites, fuck them too. You don't need their cockamaney bullshit. The weight off your mind and shoulders will be one of the most liberating feelings you will ever have in your life. \n\nYou deserve happiness, OP. Don't let anyone, family by blood or choice, random strangers, *no one,* mess with your mental/emotional wellbeing. No one is so entitled that they are allowed to destroy it with such ill-intent. Anyone who *does* allow it, is not family. I wish you all the best OP, in luck, life, and everything that exists within it.",

Then I learned what gaslighting was, and thanks to Reddit, learned what narcissistic and toxic behaviors looked like. Quite an enlightening experience, 10/10, would recommend, haha. The SO helped too, though, to be fair. He never stood for that shit, still doesn't.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, the man and I came to the decision that sacrificing my cell service was the right call. We still have a house phone (man, it feels nostalgic as hell to have a cordless phone around again), so if anything goes bad, we have it covered. Plus, the cell can still call 911 in a worst-case scenario, and we would have more money for other bills/food/emergencies. Seemed like an easy sacrifice, but I had no idea what it would bring.... And not in a bad way. Not having my phone meant I suddenly wasn't having to turn down all the job listings my sister kept sending. I didn't have to deal with the 'friendly conversations' turned guilt-trips because she didn't like hearing I was staying home with the kid for homeschool, or why I was worried to catch COVID (I have fairly severe endo all over my inner torso, lining included. Pretty sure it's near my lungs, but finding someone who will just operate, instead of putting me on hormones my body rejects, is fucking impossible.) I wasn't getting weekly messages reminding me of how much more successful my siblings were, all the milestones they were hitting, exotic places they were visiting because they're child-free. I wasn't left constantly feeling like a failure by comparison, which is honestly something they both have done since I was really, really young. I was just too blindly obligated to family to see it. Was always taught to be the better person, but never realized I could do that by walking away. \n\nThe only people I really talk to are my dad (who apologized for his past actions, and has become a much better person and parent in general), my SO, and our DnD buddies. Fuck if it isn't the most free I have ever felt in my life. It's like I finally gave myself permission to enjoy my life for what it is---something to cherish, even if it wasn't what I planned---instead of feeling guilty, like I was constantly trying to defend myself for being less-than. I can breathe for the first time in my life. I can appreciate what I do have, instead of dwelling on what I don't. It was the best gift I have ever received, and thank goodness SO helped me see it, and shut it down. It's hard to wrap my mind around how I let it go on for so long.",

What's your point.\"\n\nI love my family and we are best friends with each other, because my parents broke the cycle of abuse in their family of origins and worked hard to teach us to be kind to each other, and they taught by example.  They also went low/no contact with the abusive elements who raised them.  My Dad said that he learned how to parent from watching his parents, and saying, \"That's a thing I won't do.  And there's another thing I won't do.\" They taught him what NOT to do.  He still had to learn what to do, but I'd say he did a pretty good job.\n\nMy mother often says that she and Dad were always amazed at how well we kids turned out, and they take no credit for it.\n\nAll this is to say:  You do NOT have to keep swimming in sewage, just because someone gave birth to you.  Get out.  Take a shower, and then find your own properly clean and maintained swimming pool, filled with nice people who will welcome you and play Marco Polo, instead of cannonballing on top of your head and laugh as you drown.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBesides, the phrase \"Blood is thicker than water,\" actually comes from \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb,\" and it is talking about Family Of Choice.  It's great when your family of choice is also your family of origin, but it happens frequently enough that they are two different things, and for good reason!\n\nIf you don't want to die a miserable death after suffering long torment from cholera, get out of the sewage!",

Almost 1 of 120 pregnancies ends in stillbirth and 1 of every 4 pregnancies ends in loss. **So pregnancy has a failure rate of 25% and instead acknowledging that and providing a safety net of support and care we just tell women not to announce their pregnancies until we\u2019re reasonably sure the baby won\u2019t die because we as a society don\u2019t want to have to talk about it.** So when you miscarry there are precious few people to support you. You\u2019re grieving and yet there are no greeting cards, no one is sending flowers or bringing you casseroles so you don\u2019t have to cook while you\u2019re painfully bleeding out the pregnancy you lost.

Still a bunch of requirements but less money, but your lives could end up in upheaval for months or even years. Outside of drastic cases, the intent of the foster system is to reunite families once it\u2019s a safe living environment for the children. Anecdotally, I have a friend that went this route, foster to adopt. She took in the sweetest little 8 month old, and was told he\u2019d be eligible for adoption. She started the process. Spent months raising this child. Only to get told when he was 15 months that he was being placed back with his biological mother. She was heartbroken, but that\u2019s how the system is. \n\nI myself am adopted, and I wanted to adopt instead of going through pregnancy. We couldn\u2019t afford private adoption and I wouldn\u2019t be able to mentally take raising a child and then have to give them back. I attempted to foster a dog once. He became mine after about 30 minutes of knowing him lol. I\u2019m not a good fit emotionally for the foster system. \n\nSo long story short, I went through pregnancy.

This gets tossed at infertile couples all the time and its just a really shitty thing to say to someone who's struggling with infertility. Adoption is a great thing but it shouldn't be seen as a consolation prize for couples who can't conceive children on their own. If a couple wants their own children, it's shitty to say they should just give up on that dream of conceiving and carrying their own baby. And adoption, at least in the USA, is actually REALLY hard if you'd like to adopt a baby instead of a teenager. Fostering to adopt is its own difficult road, you have to meet lots of qualifications and actually hope that at the end of the day a child is taken from its parents forever and given to you. There's always the possibility the baby you've raised will be taken from you in the foster system and given back to incompetent birth parents. It's not a sure thing. And private adoptions not through the foster system cost about $40,000. That's about the same cost as 2 rounds of IUI and 2 rounds of IVF combined. Financially, adopting is MORE expensive than trying reproductive endocrinology. It's just not the easy answer people make it out to be with the throwaway comment \"just adopt!\"",

Anyone dealing with infertility is aware of their options. And no one should be adopting just because something else doesn\u2019t work. Adoption isn\u2019t a fix for infertility. Nor should it be suggested as one. And unless you look at every young couple and ask if they are adopting too, then your adding to the misconceptions and it makes the adopted feel like second class citizens. No adopted kid wants to be the second choice because getting pregnant didn\u2019t work, and no infertile couple wants to be told to adopt to fix their issue. Not saying you suggested it or intended it at all, but it\u2019s a common misconception that needs to be put to bed and I\u2019ll say it every time someone brings it up, because it\u2019s the go to phrase next to \u201cmaybe it\u2019s just not meant to be\u201d. And many people throw it out as a fix for loss or the inability to get or stay pregnant. Or it\u2019s used as a pivot by someone already uncomfortable with the topic of discussion. \n\nI couldn\u2019t move forward with the idea of adoption until I had made peace with my medical condition and the fall out of that medical condition. I didn\u2019t want to adopt a child just because I couldn\u2019t have a biological child. I wanted to adopt a child because I want to share my life and love with a child who needs a home and loving family. But first, I needed to heal and accept my diagnosis, grieve the fact that I won\u2019t carry my husbands biological child before I could let myself even entertain the idea of adoption. I had a lot of trauma from my infertility that won\u2019t disappear just cause there is a child in my life. Having a child is the outcome of a pregnancy or adoption. Adopting or giving birth to a child doesn\u2019t cure infertility or the struggles you went through but they get lumped together. \n\nAnd we haven\u2019t even looked at other factors when it comes to adoption, like the fees associated with it and knowing that your ability to raise a child is in the hands of someone who comes to your house and judges you after an incredibly invasive process. To some, that\u2019s too much, it\u2019s too intrusive on top of the trauma left behind from miscarriages or just the inability to get pregnant. \n\nSo as easy as it is to say \u201cwhy don\u2019t you adopt tho?\u201d, it\u2019s the very tip of the iceberg and will hurt more than it helps.",
