If it's uncomfortable to wear a traditional swim suit, and that's the only reason you don't want to go then wear board shorts or male swim trunks and a tank top or t shirt. They even male ones specifically to swim in. In case the park has rules about over clothes. There is nothing wrong with wearing opposite gender clothes. It's all just fabric. Do what you need to be comfortable. Even if that means not going.",

When I was in my teens I would just wear board shorts and a rash guard. \n\nSomething to remember (and I know this can be hard to put into practice) is that nobody is going to take any notice of you. People at the waterpark are there to have fun and swim, your swimsuit, or the amount of skin you are or arent showing, wont effect anyone.  You got this.",

Or go and bring a suit in case you change your mind there.  Side thought, can you shop for a suit that you would be comfortable in?",

Actual \"grown ups\" know that even as adults there are times when we feel uncomfortable wearing certain things....and that's okay. It is okay to cry.

It's perfectly natural at your age and still happens to me (21M) every now and then. It might feel like you ruined their day and feel like TAH because of it, and maybe you did mess up their day a bit, but it was nothing intentional and was done in no malice.I know that I always felt uncomfortable when I was away from my parents at water parks, and that is coming from a cishet white guy. If you want to, I'd say apologize if you think it would help how you feel about the situation, but I think you should be fine!\n\nOn the topic of  not wanting to be seen in a bathing suit, don't feel bad about not wanting to wear one in public, it's perfectly normal. My sister has always been uncomfortable in anything but swimshorts and a rashguard shirt, and I never judged her for doing so. Do what makes you feel comfortable (though do be willing to push your boundaries when in safe environments)",
