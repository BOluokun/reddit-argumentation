You can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m wearing a bra or not in most tops so when I can, I don\u2019t wear a bra as I find them uncomfortable.\n\nMy friend Kate 25F is getting married and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I accepted and then she texted me privately to ask if I could wear a bra for her wedding as she doesn\u2019t want me to  flash someone. \n\nI tried explaining to her that, the bridesmaid dress she had picked out had full sleeves so you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell as the material is also very thick. \n\nKate got really mad at me and my sister said maybe I should just suck it up and wear a bra. \n\nI just find it to be a weird invasive question as you literally can\u2019t tell if I had a bra on in the first place or not in that dress, and I\u2019m sure no one over there is staring at my chest.",

She got a good laugh from us all. Me being a larger guy said i never wear a bra because of that reason l.\n\n2 of the other girls said they werent wearing a bra but because of their small boobs you couldnt tell. Myself and one of the othet guys both said that we could tell, and that most of the time we can tell if they are wearing a bra or not. Its not because their boobs are big and hang down, or that we are specificall lookong at their cans, but working in an office the temp control swings wildly so it can be hot or cold. Its the nips! its always the nips that gives you away. Cold nips get hard,  its science. Womens clothing can also be thinner and or silkier than most mens shirts so sometimes its more obvious.\n\nWe said we thought they knew we could tell as it was so obvious, even the other women said they could tell. We all just assumed these 2 were fine with their nipples being visible erect in a cold merting room. One was quite embarassed and the other didnt care. It was an ongoing conversation all last week.\n\nPeople cant always tell... but sometimes we can.
