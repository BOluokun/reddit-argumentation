  "post content": "I (28F) was having dinner with my high school friend Grant (28M). For context, I went to two different high schools, High School #1 being a fundamentalist hell hole. I left High School #1 at the end of Year 9 because, to be blunt, I was being bullied mercilessly. There was a girl, Janet, who I'd briefly been friends with in Year 7. She and her loyal sidekick Katie had turned on me for reasons I never knew or understood.\n\nAfter they kicked me out of the group, Janet spent the next three years doing everything she could to make my life a living hell, bent on making sure I was friendless and isolated. Long story short, school was a nightmare. Even after I left, she tried to get to me at my new school. To this day, I don't know what her problem was. I was a desperately shy bookworm who was no threat to anybody. \n\nI now live with Complex PTSD, in part due to her cruelty (there's other reasons I don't want to go into). I'm on medication, and I see a psychiatrist. Despite all that, I'm doing very well now. I can manage my condition, I have a career I love and I'm happy. I am honestly living my best life.\n\nAnyway, it turns out Grant, despite witnessing everything Janet put me through, has been friends with Janet since we graduated. I found out he's been keeping her somewhat 'updated' on my life, and told her about my health problems she's partly responsible for, without my consent. Grant told me Janet feels \"bad\" for what happened, but apparently Janet doesn't remember what she did to me, or why.  \nGrant said Janet asked him to organise for me, her and Grant to \"hang out so we can be friends\". I said absolutely not. Grant continued, saying Janet has changed and, in her words, thinks she and I can have \"girl talk\" and it will all be ok. He started telling me she's been divorced twice and really needs friends (even her sidekick Katie severed ties with her), and can't I just meet up with her and let her say sorry?\n\nI said to Grant that Janet may 'not remember' what happened, but I'm still living with the consequences. I reminded him that she spent all of high school trying to sleep with him even though he's gay, trying to turn him against me, and told him a few specific things she'd done to me. He was shocked and said \"Wow, she was awful, but can't you just forgive her?\"\n\nHe kept trying to convince me. I ended dinner by saying \"If her 'apology' can take away my diagnosis and the past 15 years of therapy I've been in, then I'll meet her,\" I asked him to please not share any more personal details about my health to her, or any other information about where I live, work etc.\n\nGrant was disappointed with me and told me I should \"stop holding onto anger,\" and said \"Everyone goes through bad stuff, so why are you the one who's so special and gets PTSD?\". That comment cut deep.\n\nReddit, AITA for saying no? Should I \"get over it\" and be her friend?\n\nEdit: Wow, I'm so overwhelmed by the responses and kindness of people. I've read every single comment and I sincerely thank everyone for their support. \nI can forgive Janet, but seeing her or being her friend is out of the question. As for Grant, he's skating on thin ice and I will be having a very serious talk with him. It's sad but I don't think our friendship will ever be the same.\n\nEdit: My dad told me I'm just making excuses and should \"extend the hand of friendship to someone clearly making an effort\" and maybe I \"unintentionally wronged Janet\"\nI'm speechless.",

He wants to make himself feel better for being friends with a bully by getting OP involved. I'm curious as to what exactly happened between them over the years to make them close.

You also hint at other reasons behind your diagnosis than Janet\u2019s behaviour which makes her the straw that broke this particular camel\u2019s back but it would still be valid if she was the entire bale of straw in your life.\n\nProlonged consistent bullying where the victim feels trapped is in fact abuse. And it\u2019s a recognised risk factor for C-PTSD on a par with abuse at home. And it is without any other risk factors. Calling it bullying is minimising bullshit.\n\nThis situation with Grant is horrible. I imagine you are freezing up and spiralling into an emotional flashback or reliving and all your PTSD spidey senses are going haywire. It\u2019s feeling like you will never escape this feeling or the situation with Janet.\n\nI\u2019d like you to try to take a step back in the spiral and feel where the PTSD is in your body. Because Complex PTSD is a weird thing. Sometimes it is the most over reactive smoke detector in the world throwing our brain into shit fit mode because it gets an atom of a reminder of trauma. But sometimes if you can stop and breathe for a second you realise it is also our actual instincts keeping us safe. That pause allows us to smell smoke. The smoke alarm is working. It is correct. You are in the same danger. Your brain is Lassie knowing the child is in the well when last week it was crying wolf.\n\nGrant is not your friend, Grant is danger. Grant is  a threat. This is a Lassie moment where your PTSD is saving you. It\u2019s showing you to a fire exit. Leave Grant to play with matches and go breathe fresh air. I guarantee your PTSD will improve almost instantly and the feelings that remain will be \u2018normal\u2019 grief and betrayal rather than a full trauma response.\n\nIt took me a while to learn that my safety harness PTSD feels very different to my hit the panic button PTSD and learning which was which has been transformative. Just last week I had to cut a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing off after reading the cues of my own trauma and months of issues lifted fast.\n\nI also recommend Pete Walker\u2019s book on C-PTSD Surviving to Thriving. I found it as helpful as therapy for coping strategies in the immediate trauma stage. For when you are less high alert I suggest Bessel Van der Kolk\u2019s book The Body Keeps The Score.\n\nI have also found that one of the most useful trauma tools I have is the block button. I block the everloving fuck out of anyone\u2019s phone, social media, emails etc who triggers me or retraumatises me. No contact with my abusers is IRL and digital and it extends to anyone who is their flying monkey sent to do their work for them.\n\nGrant is a flying monkey and Grant can get royally fucked. He\u2019ll play the victim forever more than you blocked him like you murdered his firstborn but never stop to think \u2018oh hurtful things hurt me. I wonder if experiencing constant hurtful things like this is why OP has PTSD?\u2019 \n\nThis is because flying monkeys lack empathy and because they have the same intellect as a chimp who likes to hurl its own shit to create fun. No one needs a shit flinging chimp as a friend even if they only fling shit occasionally and are usually a cute chimp in an outfit having a tea party. Shit sticks. Time Grant finds that out.\n\nEnjoy your life not having to be hyper vigilant to shit flinging. Feels really unsettling for the first few weeks, then you wonder how you lived with shit stains everywhere for so long.",

I was relatively early in trauma therapy and deeply suicidal and it helped hugely with that and lessened a lot of my feelings of failing as a person when it explained why my brain was doing brain shit.\n\nI was toying with going back and reading it five years on to see if I can get a more observer eye reaction to it to help give better suggestions about it when I recommend it so thank you for spurring that on.\n\nI hope your therapy comes through soon and remember that trauma recovery is not linear. You will loop and spiral and often feel like you are back where you started so my suggestion is to start something like a journal, Pinterest board, art, planting a garden or anything that helps give you a gauge of your milestones and improvement without being specifically trauma focused so you can go to it and feel comfort when you feel stuck and remind yourself that even if you are spiralling the gaps between the loops are getting further apart and you are making more progress than you give yourself credit for from inside the spiral.\n\nBest of luck. And remember slow and steady wins the race. You have the rest of your life to heal from trauma. It\u2019s not like a free subscription you have to use up or lose so take breaks if needed and don\u2019t pressure yourself too much. Camp out by your trail don\u2019t hike til you collapse. A lot of trauma work is done in the \u2018down\u2019 bits not in the \u2018up\u2019 bits of active therapy sessions or reading. You need both aspects equally.",

This entire time, Janet has had tabs on you because of Grant.  \n\nNo one, not even your therapist or any other medical professional (who would be in the best position to diagnose this shit) is in the position to dictate how fast, how soon, how much, nor how their patient gets over their trauma. \n\nGrant is not a safe person.

What else has Grant shared with Janet that you told him in confidence? It will be hard to trust his answer to that type of question. \n\nI feel so sorry for you, OP. I know how hard it is to lose such a friendship, but Grant is a conditional friend. I\u2019m so sorry he\u2019s pushing you to get in touch with Janet again.
