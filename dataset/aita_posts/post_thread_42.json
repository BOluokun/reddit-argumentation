  "post content": "Hi\n\nI'll keep this simple, and avoid going over the top.\n\nIn a nutshell my GF (33) and her little girl (7) moved into my (35/M) house last year.  The house is owned and I bought it because I have two children (8 YO twins - M and F) from a previous relationship.\n\nWhen she moved her and her girl in I made it clear she was welcome to stay as long as she treated my house as she would her own.\n\nYet when she moved in her amd her daughter did the following over the last year or so.\n\n- Left mountains of food everywhere.  - Left pans of food on the kitchen counter until it went green with mold.\n- Got muck/handprints everywhere\n- Broke and refused to replace things in my house\n- Would leave the radiators, lights, gas on all day\n- Refused to tidy up saying she was tired\n- Left mountains of clothes everywhere\n- Used the floor as a rubbish bin (ended up with mice)\n- Constant drama, shouting, arguing - Witnessed by neighbours\n- Literally drained me emotionally and financially\n- Both of them gave me attitude non-stop, for no particular reason other than to stave the boredom.\n- Put holes for shelves etc in all my walls\n- Would spend money on fun things for her and her daughter, yet left me to pay the grown up things like bills, debt etc\n- Kept leaving the toilet a mess\n- Treat my own 2 children like dirt when they came over, ie shouting, drama, constantly blaming them for everything etc\n\nWhen I questioned her on any of these matters she would say I was being controlling.\n\nAbout a month ago, a serious argument erupted and I told her it's best she leave.  I said 'if you want to live like that, then go and get your own place'.  It was a shame for me to see my hard earned investment become ruined by someone with no respect for it.\n\nWe are still seeing each other, but now she has gotten her own place I feel terrible.  She's having to walk everywhere as she dosent drive, and her working hours have altered as previously I was taking her little girl to school to make life easier for her.  Also, she was only paying me \u00a3165 per month for everything, but now her bills will be in excess of \u00a3600 per month for her rent alone.\n\nI feel dreadful for this, I feel like maybe I should have had more patience towards them or been a better guy when they were here.\n\nAITA?  Or would anyone else have reacted in the same way?\n\n\nEdit: Just to follow up - She doesn't drive and I also feel bad that now she has to walk/get the bis everywhere as before I was acting like her own private taxi service.  Ie, taking her shopping, giving her daughter lifts to school and to dance classes etc.\n\nUPDATE:  Wow, didn't expect such a response from this!\n\nAfter getting many responses, roughly 90% of which say I'm NTA and the rest saying I am for staying with her I've decided to break this off.\nLike some of you've mentioned, I owe this to my children and myself to give them what they need.  A good, solid, strong dad who is happy and secure.  As of this point, she is no longer in my life.\n\nA while ago I asked my 8yo daughter if she thinks about me when she's not at my house, her answer was:\n\n \"Yes I think of you getting shouted at by XXXX\"\n\nSome of you have said I'm a shit dad for staying with her after all of this.  I would argue against this, but if I stay with her I would have to agree with you all.\n\nUPDATE:  I wasnt going to post this, but as many of you are asking about it as you consider it a factor, I'll respond.\n\nA)  No the sex was mediocre at best, once a week if I was lucky.\n\nB)  She never gave BJs\n\nC)  She INSISTED on me giving her oral sex before we slept together.  Every time.  She told me \"Go down on me, or there is no sex\"\n\nD)  Never did anything else.  Vanilla sex was as far as we ever went",

When it comes to your kids, though, I feel like that's the line. Being hesitant to leave an abuser is understandable if you fear an escalation in which your kids will be put in even greater danger, but that doesn't appear to be the case here. Maybe it's judgemental, but it's hard to respect someone who doesn't see protecting their children's physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing the greatest priority. Getting her out of the house was a great first step, but keeping her in his life means that he's keeping her in his kids' lives. Maybe OP needs therapy, or a come to jesus talk, or I don't know what, but he needs to act sooner rather than later. It's only a matter of time before she starts working on him again and then she's back in the house and the next thing you know they're married or she's pregnant, so leaving is harder, and his kids feel unsafe and abandoned, and their relationship is irreparably damaged.",

She could have had a nice home and partner with a cute family, and she threw it all away. You were being used for a cheap place to live and as a walking bank account. She brought all her \u201chardship\u201d on herself. \n\nWalk away and find someone who loves you, and your kids, and will appreciate the home you offer when that time comes - you (and he twins) have had a lucky escape from this lazy dirty mooch.

OP, do some research into what abuse looks like and see if it fits, OK? A lot of people have this idea that abuse = hitting, it's actually way more complicated than that. Even given that you've said you've broken up with her, sometimes if you don't know what to look out for you could end up in the exact same situation with someone else. Learn what the signs are so that you don't subject you and your kids to this sort of thing again. You and they deserve better.  \n\n\nAlso look up what \"gaslighting\" means if you don't know already. Cuz it sounds like she's been doing a lot of that to you.",
