  "post content": "My son Joseph \u201cJoe\u201d is 6 years old. When he was born I wanted him to know both English & Spanish because most of my family speaks only Spanish on my moms side. \n\nI mostly grew up with my dad\u2019s family after my mom passed and because of that, I lost my spanish. I couldn\u2019t properly talk with anyone from her family and took me a while to re-teach myself Spanish. I wanted my son to be able to communicate with them and obviously to have the advantage of being bilingual. Now my wife doesn\u2019t speak/understand a word of Spanish so I always played translator. Did encourage her a few times to learn while we were dating but she didn\u2019t want to. \n\nSo yes my son is bilingual and communicates with both our families perfectly. My wife never expressed having any issues with this, only occasionally reminding our son to talk to her in english because sometimes he\u2019ll forget and say something in spanish instead.\n\nMy grandma (Joe\u2019s great-grandma) has been living with us for months. She doesn\u2019t speak English (only a few words) and is very close with Joe. He\u2019s loved having her here and they\u2019re like bffs. They only speak to eachother in spanish. At dinner time I\u2019ll be translating between conversations so my wife understands because again, Joe sometimes forgets, or we\u2019ll have him repeat what he just said to her in English.\n\nMy wife was in a bad mood yesterday and when we talked she said she\u2019s tired of not understanding what our son is saying, feeling left out when he\u2019s talking and like she\u2019s not bonding with him. With that she suggested we enforce Joe to not speak Spanish here at home. \n\nI asked then how\u2019s he supposed to speak with his great grandma and she was quiet.\n\nShe told me she was just frustrated with this and me not \u201chaving her back.\u201d Which I don\u2019t think is fair to say. I always translate for her or remind Joe that he needs to speak in English so mommy can understand him too. \nI told her she\u2019s taking things a bit too far by not wanting him to speak Spanish at home AT ALL. He should be free to do so.\n\nI told her if she\u2019s feeling so left out and frustrated with not properly bonding with him, then maybe she should learn some Spanish herself instead of blaming me. I\u2019ll admit, things were tense when I said this so I did say it in a snappy tone. I just thought it was a little ridiculous to restrict him. \n\nIt\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t talk with her at all. They talk and play everyday. But I guess my grandma being here has made it seem like spanish is all she\u2019s hearing. \n\nBut she\u2019s still mad at me now and I honestly don\u2019t know why making this suggestion was so wrong. Am I missing something here? Was I an a-hole?",

Ten years later, I may have lost a lot of my Japanese, but I still remember quite a bit. I think there are people who just have trouble learning certain other languages.",

Learning a new language is a biiig investment of time and energy. Plus it takes a while before you can acquire native-level fluency or anywhere close to it. It\u2019s likely gonna take OP\u2019s wife a few months before she\u2019s able to comfortably carry on a conversation in Spanish.

It probably takes the same amount of work to be at a decent level. If not more. I worked at a French immersion school, and even by the end of grade 6, I wouldn't have called these kids fluent by any means. They'd been learning and hearing it for 7 years at this point. These kids could have a basic conversation with some minor trouble and order at a restaurant. They could understand it. These kids weren't dumb either.\n\nI started studying  Spanish in grade 10 I took my third class in grade 12. I've been to Spanish speaking countries where I've gotten to practice for 7 weeks(but not at the same time). I have taken a few other courses in Spanish, as an adult, and did the Rosetta stone.  I also am fluent in French, which helps.  I am not fluent in Spanish.  I can have conversations with native speakers. I can order in a restaurant, I could probably teach a beginner's class. But I am not fluent. My vocabulary isn't all there, and I have trouble with past and future verbs. I can conjugate some of them easily, but sometimes I have to think about it. I would not call that fluid and maybe conversational at best.\n\nThis doesn't mean I would discourage anyone from learning or trying. I would simply tell them not to be discouraged if they weren't learning it as fast as they think they should be.",

I know that you said that you had to completely re-learn, but previous exposure (especially as a child) to a language is a HUGE leg up. It\u2019s completely reasonable for you to ask her to learn, but please realize that this is a big think you\u2019re asking for, and be willing to budget time and money for real lessons from a qualified teacher. Consider offering to take on some of her household duties to free up time for her to study. If lessons require a budget sacrifice somewhere else, try to make it something that affects you more than her. \n\nAs a final note, asking you to ban Spanish in the house is 100% wrong. That said, I think you might also be going a bit too far in the other direction by refusing to restrict your son\u2019s Spanish at all. A better way to approach this is to think of it as creating specific time for English. I can\u2019t imagine that, say, designating one meal per day as \u201cEnglish time\u201d would have a negative impact on your son\u2019s Spanish skills, but might go a long way toward making sure that your wife doesn\u2019t feel excluded.",
