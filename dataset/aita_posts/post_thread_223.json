  "post content": "Hey y'all. Long time lurker and I know that there've been a ton of posts that usually\u00a0make the euthanizer the asshole. I am fully prepared to be called an a-hole here, but I do not regret what I did. Also I'm pretty intoxicated and just saw a post that\u00a0reminded me of this so here it goes.. Cheers to autocorrect.\n\nIn May, I (27m) moved back home just for the time being to save some money in order to buy a house within the next year! My sister lives at home while she finishes college. She had a golden retriever for 10 years. She loved\u00a0him and took him with her almost everywhere that he was allowed to go.\u00a0\n\nJonny (the dog) was very very sick. He went from 70 lbs to barely 50 lbs in two months. You could see his rib cage, he was shedding like crazy, and he peed AND pooped blood. She took him to the vet in July and the vet strongly advised, almost begged, her to euthanize him because Jonny could barely walk and hardly acknowledged outside stimuli. He had severe liver failure and there is no cure. She refused because she is categorically against euthanasia, and the vet could not legally do it without her permission. He gave Jonny painkillers which was good. I'm no fan of euthanasia, but looking at that dog was devastating. He laid on his side all day and was starving to death. Additionally, I did research and the vet could report her to the police for animal cruelty. That would give her a record and potentially bar\u00a0her from ever owning an animal again. I know she loved Jonny, and she's probably going through severe emotional distress, but I don't think that excuses cruelty.\u00a0\n\nA week later, I spoke with my mom and she said that she wouldn't be the one to take him to the vet, but if I did it she would be thankful. My mom is very squeamish and yes, I'm annoyed that she left this up to me. Jonny is under my mom's name because my sister was 11 when she got him. With her written permission, I took him to another vet for a second opinion. I told my sister what I was doing and she screamed, cried, and tried to stop me. I really wanted to give her the chance to say bye to Jonny\u00a0and come with me. My mom backed me up and held her off while I left. The vet agreed that he was terminally ill and in unmeasurable pain. I even asked if there was a possibility to admit him to a doggy hospital to put him on an IV and have him die naturally, but more humanely. That was not an option and she euthanized Jonny. This happened in July and my sister still won't talk to me. I moved in with a friend a week later because I didn't want to cause my sister unnecessary\u00a0distress and honestly, I'm still annoyed at\u00a0my\u00a0mother and sort of traumatized from all of this. I recently had a flashback of it and it sucked. I knew that this would ruin my relationship with my sister, but I did it anyway, so that makes me feel like an asshole. However, the way I see it is, I would never leave a family member to die on the living room floor, even if a relative that was closer to that family member demanded it.\u00a0\n\n\\*\\*Edit\\*\\* grammar and gotta say my sis has been vegan since she was 12 so the anti-euthanasia is suuper deep-seeded. I appreciate y'all telling me that she might get over it someday, but I'm not banking on it. ",

Nothing that impacted her quality of life which is why when she started going outside of the litter box we kind of just decided that it was something we could deal with until her quality of life *was* impacted. She was like 12 when it started which was when the same issues started cropping up in my other cat, but then in March of this year all of a sudden her back legs stopped working and she couldn\u2019t control her bladder anymore in the span of literally 12 hours from the morning to the evening and that\u2019s when we decided it was time. She actually died in my arms on the way to the vet, so we knew it would have been the right decision.\n\nFor my older cat I could not let go when it was time because I got her in 1st grade and because of that she ended up restricted to one room unless one of us had her in our bedroom because she started peeing on the hardwood. She stopped grooming herself and wasted away and I was brushing her daily and spending a lot of time with her but then her back legs stopped working. It still took me a couple weeks to put her to sleep after that because I loved her so much, and I will probably regret and feel guilty about that for the rest of my life. It was so hard seeing her suffer but I justified it because I was still doing everything I could to keep her happy and she was still purring perpetually when I was spending time with her. It was wrong and selfish and I can\u2019t imagine ever doing it again, especially under the guise of caring about an animal\u2019s right to be alive. Which is why I made the difficult choice pretty much immediately with the cat we lost in March.\n\nGod I\u2019m crying just typing out what I did to the one and thinking about the more recent loss.",

That doesn't make a lick of sense.\n\nShe's been vegan since she was a child so surely she must know there's no connection with euthanasia and veganism? Unless it's something like disagreeing with the likes of PETA killing animals unnecessarily? \n\n\nDid she tell you this herself or are you just assuming it? Genuinely curious.\n\n\nAnyway, back to the point. Assuming this story is true then you're NTA.",

She also sees it as a consent issue because Jonny could not consent and we were making decisions for him. He never had any say in which dog food he ate or when he went for walks either. We followed the experts and walked and fed him as recommended! Honestly, I see her point but I more think that that's an argument to push for physician assisted suicide for humans, more than banning it for dogs.",

As their caretakers it is our job to do things to keep them happy and healthy even if it\u2019s something they wouldn\u2019t necessarily consent to because they don\u2019t have the intelligence to make the right decision. I mean, a dog would consent to drinking anti-freeze if given the choice because it tastes good to them. It\u2019s the same with kids. Yes, as they grow they can start consenting to things, but overall as parents we have to make decisions for them that keep them healthy and happy. A toddler would consent to eating poison if we asked because they were curious about it. Consent doesn\u2019t always equal good or right decisions.",

Nope she doesn\u2019t like it. Vaccinations? She can\u2019t say yes so I should just let her take her chances. Not letting her run out in the street? Downright oppressive. Putting a cone on her to stop her from giving herself hotspots and/or making them worse? I must barely be human. I also have to stop her from eating things that could literally poison her all the time, but since she deserves autonomy to make decisions about her diet on her own, I must be a goddamn monster. Did she pet the dog? Because he couldn\u2019t consent to that either.\n\nIf my math is right, our sister is what, 21 or 22? She is old enough to know logically that the concept of wanting consent from a dog when it comes to basic care and quality of life is ridiculous. Choosing to euthanize your pet when their quality of life is no longer there is what you are supposed to do as a pet owner and refusing to do so is cruel. I would stop avoiding her and just stick to one question every time she brings this up: Did you want him to suffer?\n\nAnd only accept a yes or no answer from her because that\u2019s what this boils down to. Not euthanizing him was causing him to suffer. That is an objective fact. An animal cannot consent to any of the things we do to care for them. That is another objective fact. Part of caring for an animal is knowing when it\u2019s time to let them go and that time should always be when there is no longer any kind of quality of life.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long response this just makes me really angry.",
