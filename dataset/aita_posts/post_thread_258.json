  "post content": "My son is a 20 month old toddler, my wife is a stay-at-home mom, I work six days a week and I'm usually gone for twelve hours a day.\n\nI always check in on my son remotely via our nursery cam app and he's always awake in the mornings around 8:00. He has a great sleep routine. Our \"wind down\" time starts at the same time every evening, we clean up toys, read a book, when I lay him down he's still awake, he falls asleep on his own and sleeps all night for at least twelve hours.\n\nIt's usually after 9:00 before I have a chance to check the camera, this morning when I checked it was 9:12 and some mornings are closer to 10:00. Every time I look though, he's awake in the dark and standing in his crib just waiting. When I see this, I immediately turn on the brightest night light the camera has and speak to him through the camera app. I always tell him good morning and I love him and he usually laughs and says \"Dada\". Then I leave the app and call my wife to wake her up.\n\nI usually have to call three to four times and when she finally answers, it's obvious that she just woke up and only because I called. I tell her that our son is awake waiting for her and that she needs to get up to start their day.\n\nThis morning while on the phone, I asked her if she was going to get him after using the bathroom and she said no, she was going to the kitchen to prepare their breakfast and THEN she'd get him. I asked her to get him after the bathroom so he could go to the kitchen with her and she flipped out. She told me it pisses her off that I call EVERY morning to tell her how to be a mom and that she has a routine. I retorted with \"well, your routine sucks because he's been awake for an hour and you'd still be asleep if I hadn't called\".\n\nI just bothers me that he has to wait so long. He needs a diaper change, he's probably thirsty, hungry and just wants to play.\n\nAm I wrong though? Do I need to stop? Please be completely honest with your answers. Thanks!\n\n\n\n**EDIT #1**\n\n\n\nI was banned from commenting within the first hour because I violated a rule in a comment and that's why I wasn't responding to anyone. I'm a fairly new Reddit user in terms of posting - I normally read a lot and that's all - and because of this, I had no clue that a temporary comment ban didn't affect my ability to edit the post. I would have edited the post much sooner had I known I was able to regardless of the comment ban.\n\nThere are so many things that need to be addressed about this post and the most important one is about my wife. I love her more than anyone on Reddit thinks I do. She is an amazing woman and a wonderful mother. I absolutely DO NOT think she is an incompetent parent nor do I think she neglects my son. None of the information I provided was ever supposed to convey that negative message about her.\n\nMy whole issue was: \"he's awake, he's been awake, why are you still asleep?\" - that's all, and she agreed she stays up too late plus has alarms set now.\n\nI showed my wife how this post EXPLODED and she COULD NOT believe the kind of attention it got. She is very much in love with me and does not agree that I am controlling nor does she believe that I am micromanaging her daily life.\n\nAlso, because so many people believe that I intentionally left out the medical issues she has, I'll list them here:\n\n- postpartum depression\n- low vitamin B-12\n- chronic fatigue\n\nNow, let me explain why I didn't list them originally.\n\nHer low vitamin B-12 is not a deficiency, her level is just lower than what is considered \"best\" for her age; this is according to recent bloodwork that I recommended. The results state that any number between 100 pg/mL and 914 pg/mL is \"within normal range\", and her level is 253 pg/mL. The doctor suggested sublingual B-12 1000mcg daily to raise the level a little, but stated that apart from that, she could not find a reason for the chronic fatigue. Because of these results, and especially after purchasing the supplements, in my mind, the B-12 is not a problem. Also, the bloodwork confirmed that everything else was normal.\n\nThe postpartum depression is actively being monitored and treated by a professional. My wife literally goes to a psychiatrist, or psychologist (I can't remember their exact title) multiple times a year and we pay for medication every 30 days. She initially tried depression medication, followed the regimen religiously and not much changed for her. This was addressed in a following appointment and a new medication was prescribed. Her current medication is normally used to treat ADHD or narcolepsy and the doctor believed it would alleviate some of her tiredness and release more dopamine thus providing more energy in her daily life. This does seem to be true and she seems to be happy with the medicine.\n\nThe chronic fatigue is a result of her own poor scheduling and personal health. She has agreed that she spends too much time sitting and using the phone. She naps when our son naps and has trouble falling asleep at a normal bedtime hour due to this daytime sleep. We always go to bed together and he's told me multiple times that she moved to the living room after I fell asleep because she couldn't sleep and was bored just lying there. Then, midnight or later comes, she's finally drowsy and decides to sleep. However, the overstimulation from social media and phone usage makes it difficult for her brain to reach REM sleep normally. So she falls asleep at 12:00, our son wakes up at 8:00, eight hours have passed and she still feels tired and not at all rested.\n\nI do know and have known about her condition. We have agreed to disagree about the cause of her sleeping problems. In her mind she has chronic fatigue because of insomnia and it's a vicious cycle. In my mind she stays up too late on the phone and doesn't get the sleep her body needs.\n\nWhether the internet thinks she is a bad mother, negligent, lazy or abusive is not important. I know and love the woman I married, I do feel comfortable leaving her with our kid and she does an amazing job with him. In a few comments I stated that she was lazy and didn't do much at home. I won't deny those statements, but in the moment I was still aggravated because the argument over the phone had just recently ended. I don't truly think she's lazy because I've seen what she can do; I just think she's unmotivated due to a lack of sleep and the same four walls every day.\n\nFinally, I am not spying on her or my son. We only have two cameras in this house and both are in our son's room. One camera provides a wide-angle view of the entire room and the other is positioned directly above his crib. The cameras serve no purpose during the day because I'd barely be able to hear background noise from another room even if I did try to listen in.\n\nMy wife is an amazing woman and an amazing mother. My son is just so happy all the time, he's super smart, full of energy and extremely healthy. I will not be hiring a nanny or using a daycare. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what my wife does during the day, I just wish she'd start her day earlier for my little man.\n\nI want to say thank you to everyone who commented on this post and messaged me. My wife and I had a long, in-depth conversation last night after all of the attention this post received and I've shown her everything. There were tears, much more laughs and a lot of things to think about.\n\nI think the most important thing we learned is that so many people are quick to judge and that in itself is a very big problem.\n\n\n\n**EDIT #2**\n\n\n\nI need to make it clear that my wife does not have narcolepsy. She is not taking medicine for narcolepsy. I said that the medicine she takes now is USUALLY used to treat narcolepsy or ADHD. She also does not have ADHD.\n\nThe second thing we learned is that people love to add details and change the story.",

He\u2019s needs a diaper change, and probably hungry!\nI understand an hour, letting your wife wake up, shower makes coffee get herself ready and then get the baby! But more than 2 hours and she\u2019s still dead asleep, having to call her 3 times before she answers. Your son is getting older, and that\u2019s when babies start climbing out of the crib. Maybe you need to sit with your wife and figure out what\u2019s going on, if she in fact does have her routine with the baby and these are just off days you seen her in.\n\nEdit: Op has stated in the comments that his wife has chronic fatigue, but she doesn\u2019t take her b12 shots because she forgets. Baby sleeps thru the night, mom is able to sleep thru the night, her waking up late is her choice. She\u2019s a mother now, her baby relies on her to eat! Him not crying isn\u2019t even the point, he\u2019s at the age will he will start getting curious, getting out the crib and exploring. Her establishing a routine with her son would work better for her, she can nap when he naps. If she\u2019s not able to force herself to get up, She and Op need to sit down and discuss getting help. Again him entertaining himself is not the issue, the issue is being awake for hours before mom acknowledges him. Accidents happen even when your watching, but being left unsupervised the risk is bigger. All these YTA comments are only looking out for the wife, what about the baby?! Would you still say YTA if it was the dad sleeping in, we\u2019re always so quick to judge the fathers but not the mothers.\n\n\nThank you guys for the awards\u263a\ufe0f",

How many days a week?\n\nSo let\u2019s say mom gets 6-7 of those remaining 10.5 hours of the day to sleep. I\u2019m telling you right now that\u2019s not enough sleep. It\u2019s not enough sleep for most normal people (I know some people survive on 6, but the average recommended is 8 hours). It\u2019s certainly not enough sleep for a person doing 100% of child rearing for 13.5 hours a day, several days a week.

If she has more time to rest, she will be better able to take care of the things she\u2019s responsible for in a manner that you probably find more fitting (i.e. \u201cnormal\u201d). If you have the time to face chat with kiddo nearly every morning and then call mom multiple times, it stands to reason you could instead be assisting her in ways that she would actually appreciate \u2013 and that would actually be *helpful* to her.\n\nHow about reminding her about her B12? How about checking in to see if she\u2019s taken her meds or a quick mood check? Order lunch or groceries to be delivered to her so she doesn\u2019t have to cook every so often, or go out to the store (if she does presently). Ask her and figure out how you can help *together*.\n\nYou really need to talk with her and understand her illnesses.
