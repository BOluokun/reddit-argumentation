  "post content": "So shopping yesterday, I told my wife that I would like a sandwich that we make that has some Pesto Basil sauce on it.  My wife asked what ingredients we needed to make the sandwiches and I stated one, which was the sauce.  She says \"We have that in the fridge at home, we don't need to buy more.\"  I replied with \"Well, it's probably over 2 months expired and I would like to get a new one just in case the one at home is no longer good.\"  (We live 20 miles from town so it would suck to have to go out and get more, yeah wasteful but I don't want to take an HOUR for a $6 ingredient that may or may not be good.)  She comes back with a snarky \"Why is it still in the fridge then.\"  I reply with \"Nobody threw it away.\"  She immediately starts to berate me saying that I should have included myself in the response.  I told her I did when I said \"NOBODY\" which includes me.  She didn't take that as acceptable and we fought for nearly 4 hours on little things because she thought I was being an @$$hole.  To me it was a perfectly normal and civil conversation until that moment.\n\nShe's constantly calling me a gas-lighter and saying how my responses are construed as me being a complete asshole and quite frankly, I think SHE'S the gas-lighter on how she is treating me and saying I am doing things I am absolutely NOT doing.  She thinks ANYTHING I say is not the right way of doing it...  I have no problems with anyone else and she always states \"You don't talk to your friends this way\" when I absolutely treat her no differently than anyone else, other than she is my wife and I do respect her and love her, but lately things are going down hill with how she portrays the way I act.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not including referring to myself in the above situation?\n\nEDIT:  So we didn't argue for 4 hours over the sauce itself...  But it was that subject that caused her to start nit-picking EVERYTHING I said...  \"Should we get lettuce or sprouts?\"  \"I don't care, whatever the hell you want.\"  \"Well, I'm asking you what YOU prefer on the sandwich because I'm not picky, I'll eat just about anything.\"  So yeah, wasn't 4 hours of SAUCE arguing.
