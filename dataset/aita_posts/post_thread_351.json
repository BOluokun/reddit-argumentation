  "post content": "I have an 11 year old daughter, Ellie. She has a best friend, Sophie, (12). Both of the girls have special needs and are around 6 years old mentally. \n\nSophies mom called me yesterday, said that they were at an indoor playground, and Sophie wanted to know if Ellie could come and play. Sophies mom offered to put me on her punch card (she prepays for 10-20 visits at a time because it\u2019s cheaper) so it would be free for me so I got Ellie in the car and we met them at the playground. \n\nAfter about an hour of playing, the girls started to get hungry. I packed a snack for Ellie but Sophie\u2019s mom didn\u2019t have any snacks on her. I told her they sell snacks in the front but she claimed that she didn\u2019t have any money on her and asked me to buy Sophie some goldfish. I said sure, Venmo me and I\u2019ll grab some. \n\nI said no, I took care of my kid and it\u2019s not my job to take care of hers too. She says she paid for my kid to get in so I could cover the $2 for the goldfish. I told her if she wanted me to bring snacks she should\u2019ve told me when she invited me but I won\u2019t be wasting $2 for a $.50 bag of goldfish because she was unprepared. She went up to the front and I don\u2019t know if she lied about not having money but she came back with goldfish and fruit snacks. Now she\u2019s being petty by asking me to pay her back for all of the times we\u2019ve used their memberships and guest passes so we\u2019re not getting along. \n\nI\u2019m going to have to see her at school drop off/pickup, ballet class, gymnastics class, and the girls weekly play dates so I wanted to know if I was the asshole for not buying her kid a snack.",

Why didn\u2019t you also take snacks for the other child?  Yes, you did not have to do so, and that child is not your responsibility, but if I was meeting someone for a playdate for my child, not paying to get in, knowing, at some point both girls were going to be hungry, I would have packed snacks for both, as a thank you for the invitation and just because.  I would call the other mom TA as well, because if she has passes to this place, she knows her child will want a snack, but from your other comments, this seems to be a recurring theme for you.  Your daughter is invited numerous times?  You accept the generosity, but do not reciprocate in any way?   At least not that you state.  So, due to a pack of goldfish, because of you, your daughter might not see so many invites to playdates any longer.  Exactly, who is mentally 6 years old in this snenario?  The children or the parents?,",

He too was traveling to Michigan so he told her that he would help her until they reached Michigan.  She said he slung his military nap sack over his shoulder, picked me up and grabbed one of her luggage.  She said she was sort of embarrassed because they were getting strange looks because she was a Black woman and he was a White man.  And since both my brother and myself were very light skinned, people assumed that they were a couple/married.  She said he was a trooper, and when people would look askew at them, he would ask them if they had a problem.  She said he sat in the seat right across the aisle from her so that I could have sleeping space for myself and my brother could have his own sleeping space next to our Mom.  He stayed by Mom's side all the way to Michigan until we got off (he had to go to upper Michigan).  She said she was so appreciative of his kind gesture and have never forgotten it.",

          "content": "Keep in mind, it's not even a membership. Other mother is literally paying for OP's daughter to get in. I know the places she is talking about. Say it's $8 per kid to get in each time, but if you buy a 10 pass, it will only cost $60. So other mother used one of those pre-paid entrance fees on OP's kid. \n\nAnd what grown adult asks someone to Vemno $2? Especially someone who just paid for your kid to get in.\n\nOP being YTA is going to hurt her child in this lost friendship and future lost friendships because no other parent is going to want to deal with her. I'm sure this kind of pettiness and lack of acknowledgement for another's generosity goes beyond this single instance.\n\nEdit: seeing OP comments, looks like entrance fee is $15 but it's $100 for a 10 pack. So not only did other mother save her $15, other mother has paid for OP's daughter *multiple times.* But OP justifies refusing to pay $2 for a snack because other family has more money and a 2 parent household, and that's supposedly not fair that she has to give them anything in return. And it's not fair that she has to explain to her daughter about why they have more things. Ugh, I feel for OP's kid.\n\nOP, here's the thing. You started all this over literally *two dollars.* Let's ignore everything else for a second- cost of entrance fee, whether she remembered to pack snacks, etc. You have a special needs daughter who, I'm guessing, does not have a lot of friends. You are ruining her friendship over $2. Further, it seems this family has paid multiple times for your daughter to play somewhere you admittedly said you'd never take her to had you had to pay. So your daughter has an enriched life with a good friend to play with and from a family willing to pay for your daughter to enjoy what she otherwise couldn't. And yet you ignore all of this and get petty over $2. Then you come on here and by your pushback on comments, still think you are the victim. The only victim here is your daughter who now has to deal with the detrimental effects to her life because her mother ignored what was at stake for a measly $2.",
