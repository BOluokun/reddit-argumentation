We have always been very silly in said game and not taken things super seriously.  In one round I ran out of things to do and decided to pull a small prank. I was setting things up and had not even pulled it off and ended up chickening out.\n\nLenda got really angry at me for a part of the set up and for a second game in a row she started getting really angry and me and berated me for my fun. She then threw the rest of the round.\n\nAt the end in the lobby Trisha tried to see if we wanted to keep playing. Rachel and I both responded positively even though we both were starting to think the mood was ruined. Lenda refused to answer at first and then very angrily said sure. \n\nAt that point my anger got the best of me, and I said, \"You know what I'm done here have a good night, everyone\" and left.   \n\n\nAfter that Rachel messaged me and agreed Lenda was being really rude and ruined the fun. Trisha messaged me as well apologizing for the game going bad even though it was not her fault.\n\nThat made me feel really bad and like I was an ass for trying to pull the prank and ruining the night that way.\n\nSo, I just wanted to ask, Am I the A-hole for trying to pull the prank and getting angry at Lenda for blowing up at me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I may be the A-hole for trying to pull and prank and ruining everyone's night.",
