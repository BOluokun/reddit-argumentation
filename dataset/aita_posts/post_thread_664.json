  "post content": "So. I have an older brother. He is 25. I am 19. He is gay but he is closeted. He has only told me and his close friends about his gayness. Our parents are conservative. He is not my mother\u2019s child, only my father\u2019s. His real mother is a deadbeat. However if he came out I am certain my father would come around to it, only because over the years he\u2019s gradually distanced himself from our old church because of how hateful the pastors\u2019 associates have become toward gay people. It\u2019s not an endorsement of their lifestyle, but it is a refusal to despise them. However he still thinks he has the right to deny baking a cake for them. \n\nI disagree with my father and my parents\u2019 conservativeness, but have yet to vocalize said disagreements. I merely keep a safe distance since I\u2019m in college. My brother however still tries to please them because I think he is conflicted. He still has Christian ideals and prays but his friends don\u2019t share the same values (a lot of them are off the books weed/coke  dealers). He\u2019s a bit of an alcoholic because of the fights he got into with our controlling parents growing up and I wouldn\u2019t call him a deadbeat because he\u2019s a very skilled manager at a retail store and did graduate college buuut all his free time is spent partying and abusing drugs as he tries to support his friends\u2019 rap career (he\u2019s apart of their group and frankly they suck. I wouldn\u2019t disparage them if they didn\u2019t pretend to be better than they are or ridicule me for being book smart, but the only person in their group that has a shot at making it is their producer because he can make beats in the style of many other producers. Lyrically speaking they need some help.)\n\nMy brother is a pretty macho fella. I am not. I do like sports, i play with my friends, but i don\u2019t have as much muscle mass as him despite being toned/muscular myself. He used to bully me because he was treated as the problem child by my parents growing up but that all changed when i played sports in high school. I wouldn\u2019t call him \u201cnice,\u201d but i would say he became invested in my athletic career and gave me helpful pointers, but it was primarily to preserve his reputation at our high school/college. His athletic career was the only way he could gain favor with my dad who served in the military. \n\nAs i mentioned earlier his friends are into drug abuse. He is heavily invested in a thuggish image that he maintains on his private instagram. He used to constantly pick on me for being a square and doing well in high school and college. I don\u2019t resent him as much because I understand where he\u2019s coming from and I\u2019ve secretly been going to therapy for the last year to feel better about myself. I wouldn\u2019t say I am at 100%, but I am far more confident than I used to be. Occasionally though i will be reminded of something he did and it\u2019ll fuck up my whole day. (nitpicking my athletic performance in front of others, calling me gay as a kid cause I was into opera and Sailor Moon, criticizing me in front of our veteran of a dad when i wore brighter colors, belittling my interest in theater, etc.) One day he called me crying while drunk and apologized for being an asshole, but he hasn\u2019t really changed much. He\u2019ll still occasionally call me pansy or queer, despite my protests. I only know about him being gay because he opened up to me while under the influence, and told me \u201cto never mention it again\u201d when he sobered up. One of his friends mentioned it in front of me and he was pissed. \n\nAnyhoo, I attended a Christmas Eve family event and brought two friends. Word got around that I made the honor roll. He scoffed and rolled his eyes. My mother made a smart ass remark at my brothers\u2019 expense. She said she meant it as a joke but it pissed him off. He glared at her and walked out. He returned a couple of hours later and talked to her privately, but he was drunk as fuck. I could tell by his staggering. She urged him to drink some water and sober up and he initially listened but couldn\u2019t resist the call of my cousins playing basketball in the driveway. \n\nHe began to show off in front of my younger cousins. He was sloppy and unnecessarily aggressive. My cousins are 14, 16, and 17. I was already outside with my friends watching and we decided to go to one of their houses. My brother continuously taunted me as I left and threw the basketball at my head. I gave him the bird as I was slowly losing my cool then he continued to taunt me \u201ccone here pussy, come play with me ya little queer\u201d etc etc and I lost it. \u201cYoure the only real queer around here.\u201d He came at me but I ran away and all my friends and cousins subdued him. He cursed me as I got into my car and my dad and all the dudes came outside to find out what happened. He brushed it off and walked away. I haven\u2019t talked to him since and he didn\u2019t show up for Christmas breakfast. \n\nI really hate that I outted him but there\u2019s a part of me that feels good about it. I finally hurt him. But I outted him in front of my cousins who I\u2019m certain relayed the info to my uncle and father. Dads been pretty stern all morning. \n\nAITA? Could there have been a better way to go around this? He just makes me feel so weak and he\u2019s projected his weakness and \u201c\u201deffiminacy\u201d\u201d on to me for so fucking long and it felt good to hurt him back. I just hate that it was at an inconvenient time for him and could mar his already shit relationship with our parents. Being closeted is more-so about survival than anything else and i feel like shit\n\nTLDR; My closeted bully of an older brother got mad at me at Christmas Eve dinner bc my mom showed off my academic success at his expense. He taunted me while playing basketball calling me pansy and queer and I outted him. AITA?",

Help your dad see that we all are sinners and fall short.  Anyone who has a relationship with God is good because He gives us grace- unconditional love and undeserved forgiveness. Nothing else needs to be said or questioned there. \n\n\nOlder folks have had a harder time coming to terms with that because for so long the church explicitly preached against homosexuality.  We\u2019ve had to sort of try to \u201cre-educate\u201d the older generation in our families with short, informal conversations.  Progress has been made. \n\n\nIf your brother sees you standing up for gay acceptance, hopefully he will see he has an ally and completely stop his bullying. ",

In fact, these people should be actively outed as payback for their shitty deeds. In your brother\u2019s case, I think I can see why you did it in the heat of the moment. I don\u2019t think you fucked up. You were pushed to the edge and taunted with homophobic slurs until you pushed back. You did nothing wrong. Your brother\u2019s toxic relationship with his own sexuality from your family dynamic has caused him to weaponize masculinity and used being gay as an ultimate put down. If he had been conflicted internally it would have been fine. But he is lashing out with his behaviour and projecting his self loathing onto others, namely you. In that situation, I would not fault you for rejecting his queer insult but putting it back on him. Cut yourself some slack. Your brother did it to himself.",

Not even considering the fact that the brother is older and thus should behave more responsibly than OP. Yea sure, brother may suffer some consequences such as potential conflict with his father, but it sounds as if the father has been warming up to the LGBTQ community for a while now and the consequences may not be as severe as you predict. On top of that, the brother is 25 and lives alone, which makes it safer for him if his parents\u2019 community chooses not to accept the fact that he is gay.

I think it's the right thing to do it (though he will be lying). Or maybe it won't have to come to that. The fact is we don't know how people reacted to OP's statement.

Bullying in general can be just as dangerous as outing someone, so those things cancel each other out to me.
