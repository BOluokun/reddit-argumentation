  "post content": "I\u2019m a teenager, and during COVID while I was at home I began to learn baking as a way to relieve stress. One of my favorite desserts is brownies. I started with a very basic brownie recipe, but slowly I\u2019ve made it more and more elaborate to achieve ultimate chocolate fudge status. \n\nI do not really bake with anyone else in mind. I just like trying recipes. Most of the time it\u2019s a treat everyone can enjoy, but sometimes one of my three family members won\u2019t like what I made.\n\nAt some point along the way, I watched a 100-hour brownie recipe and got the idea to start adding decaf coffee (I can\u2019t do caffeine for other reasons). I tried it, it was delicious, and my mother and brother absolutely loved it. My father didn\u2019t know what it was and ate them too, but when I revealed my \u201csecret ingredient\u201d was coffee, he got really upset. \n\nEver since then, every time I make brownies he asks me to take the coffee out. I tell him no because it\u2019s my recipe (that\u2019s the part where I might be a total AH\u2014I\u2019m kind of stubborn about it). It\u2019s not like it stops him from eating them. He ate 1/2 of a 9\u201d pan in less than 24 hours last time (with coffee). \n\nLast night my college quarter ended, so I specifically made MYSELF a pan of brownies in celebration. Of course, everyone was welcome to share my celebration. \n\nFor some reason, that particular night my dad simply got absolutely ticked that I wanted to add coffee\u2014a little more of it, actually, and some dark chocolate, since that\u2019s really what I\u2019ve wanted to do. I tried to reason out that these were brownies for me really, but he just got more and more angry (I want to say whiny, but that feels mean). \n\nI added extra coffee anyway and baked them. Pure chocolate heaven! Best brownies yet. Denser than a black hole. Delicious. \n\nThis morning he was very upset because he tasted the coffee and told me he was hurt. He then took 3 brownies from the pan and returned to his office (I\u2019m not shoving them down his throat..?). \n\nSomeone told me to just separate the batter into 2 bowls and bake them with and without coffee, but I usually can\u2019t afford to double the recipe and I don\u2019t have half pans. I also don\u2019t want to end up in my mom\u2019s conundrum\u2014when she cooks, she almost always has to prepare two separate dinners (one for the rest of us, one for my dad without spices/onions/\u2018weird sauce\u2019 and usually more centered around cheese/Taco Bell fire sauce/tortillas. Basically everything is a burrito). My brother and I help her out with cutting and prepping dinner since we\u2019ve both gotten into cooking (and helped her get over her fear of us holding knives\u2014thanks Food Network!). Still, though, it\u2019s tedious to make a Bland and Good variations of a dish every time. Also doubles the leftover containers. \n\nAITA for adding coffee to my brownies knowing that my Dad (1 of 3 other people in my house) hates coffee?\n\nEdit: recipe https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jxs9nx/aita_for_adding_coffee_to_brownies_despite_my_dad/gcyrne9/?context=3\n\nEdit for Update: I made cinnamon rolls for my dad instead because I didn\u2019t want to remove coffee from my brownies.

      "content": "Alright so people are asking for the recipe and not gonna lie, I\u2019m very very very new to baking (less than a year), so I\u2019m a bit intimidated. A little worried my taste buds might have lower standards for heaven, but here goes nothing. \n\nSo first and foremost, I\u2019m not a culinary mastermind. I\u2019ve pulled from a few sources, 97% from this link (https://cafedelites.com/best-fudgy-cocoa-brownies/) by someone going by the name Karina (Karina, if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re a genius and I love you). The 100-hour brownie recipe I watched/referenced is by Alvin Zhou (video here: https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCsdD3quGf01RWABJt8wLe9g), who makes absolutely excellent videos even if you\u2019re not interested in making anything. I think there may be some little tidbits of advice I\u2019ve pieced together here and there from others, and unfortunately I don\u2019t have sources for those. :( \n\nRecipe: \n\nINGREDIENTS (prepping them listed in recipe below):\n\u20141/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter\n\u20141 tablespoon canola oil\n\u20141/2 cup + 1 tablespoon white granulated sugar\n\u20141/2 cup + 1 tablespoon brown sugar\n\u20142 large eggs\n\u20142-2.5 teaspoons (kinda dealer\u2019s choice here) of pure vanilla extract\n\u20141/2 cup all purpose flour\n\u20141/2 cup (rounded-ish) unsweetened cocoa powder, usually I get Hershey\u2019s (live near there)\n\u20141/4 teaspoon salt\n\u20141 cup of chocolate chips of choice (usually Tollhouse Semisweet) OR (luxury version for super deluxe special occasions) 1 bar of Ghirardelli baking chocolate (usually I do semisweet) cut into fun little chunks\n\u2014anywhere between 2 teaspoons to 1 rounded tablespoon (lately I\u2019ve been doing 1 tablespoon even) of Some sort of coffee grounds. I use Starbucks cafe Verona (dark roast) decaf because it was already in my cabinet, so it\u2019s \u201cfree to me.\u201d \n\u2014Optional: 1 cup of mini marshmallows to toast on top (sometimes I prefer to leave these off, sometimes I really crave them. Depends)\n\nACTUALLY MAKING THE THING:\n\n\u2014Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 F. \n\u2014Grease a 9x9 square pan with Pan for baking (has flour in it). Forgetting this honestly isn\u2019t the end of the world, just harder to clean. I prefer stoneware, but metal obviously works fine. \n\u2014melt the stick of butter in your large mixing bowl. For my microwave, that\u2019s 2 rounds of 30 seconds. Might wanna put a paper towel or plate on top to make sure your microwave doesn\u2019t get messy. It\u2019s pivotal that this is HOT. \n\u2014add your canola oil and sugars. Honestly I don\u2019t always level off my sugars super well so extra doesn\u2019t hurt, just as long as it\u2019s not *too* much extra. \n\u2014whisk this WELL, if you have a mixer USE IT. Do it for a full minute or until your gut says the deed is done. You want this as well-incorporated as possible, because this is what makes crispy brownie tops regardless of how fudgy the brownies are.\n\u2014Add your two eggs (you can do both at once) and your vanilla (original recipe was 2 tsp vanilla, I usually get indulgent and add an extra 1/2 tsp). \n\u2014SIFT in your flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Make the decision of whether or not to add coffee, and add coffee. Also add in your chocolate chips (save a bit to sprinkle on top). \n\u2014S T O P. Listen carefully. This is what I mess up. You cannot go ham mixing this. You gotta fold it. Scoop under it with a rubber spatula like you don\u2019t wanna wake the batter and then softly plop that on top and keep doing that until everything is *just* mixed. The more you mix after that point, the less fudgy it\u2019s going to be. \n\u2014pour/\u201cplop\u201d that chunk of batter in there, maybe take a few spoonfuls for yourself. Smooth it out a bit. \n-sprinkle on chocolate chips and marshmallows (optional). Marshmallows may make the top crust a little less crispy so keep that in mind.\n\u2014if you\u2019re using a metal pan, the original recipe recommends you bake for 20-25 minutes. I\u2019ve never tried that. I use a stoneware pan, which I start at 30 minutes and then check if it jiggles in the center. No jiggles+crust? You\u2019re done. Jiggles? Pop it in for five more minutes and check back. Honestly it doesn\u2019t taste bad if it\u2019s half raw anyway so just don\u2019t burn it. \n\u2014remove and let cool. I\u2019m a huge fan of warm brownies, but honestly these taste better cooled and well-rested. \n\nIf y\u2019all try this and find better ways to do it, please tell me your secrets! I\u2019m still very very new to baking so I know what I do might not be the best solution.\n\nEdit: an award?!!!! With an animation?! Y\u2019all are such sweethearts. Thank you, kind stranger. I hope the recipe is as good as I think. :)\nEdit 2: awwww!!! Y\u2019all have made my day. Two awards! I wish I could bake you some brownies myself :) lemme know if any of you have questions or suggestions.\n\nExtra edit: holy smokes. Y\u2019all know you made my day, right? I\u2019ve been skipping around with a smile. This is way beyond the support I\u2019d thought I would get. It\u2019s been great talking to people who actually know how to bake well!!!

I baked three batches that first week (most went to work with my wife) and that recipe is single handedly responsible for stopping my weight loss.  I\u2019ve shared it with the mod team multiple times raving about them and converted a handful of them as well.\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively simple recipe, but the results are phenomenal.  The only real secret is a few of the ingredients are pretty specific (you want a decent chocolate bar and a high fat content cocoa powder.  And the browning the butter is a little different but super simple following her directions.  The first few times I baked it I used the coca powder and chocolate I found in my local grocery store and whatever pan I had on hand, and it was amazing.  But getting the correct cocoa powder, chocolate, instant espresso, and the anodized aluminum pan took it an extra step up.\n\nStella Parks is honestly a baking goddess too.  My favorite vanilla cake is also one I made following her recipe.  Same goes with my chocolate Swiss mergangue buttercream frosting.  I bought her book recently (full of classic American desserts that really tap into nostalgia) and its similarly fantastic.

And it certainly doesn't stop him from gorging on the brownies. \n\nI feel like your dad is just used to getting his way and being indulged by your mom - which is her business. But your refusal to do what your mom does is his REAL problem.",

Besides the coffee please explain to me what about my brownies you object to?  I\u2019m asking because you are still eating it. \n\n\nMy dad hates coffee. Cant stand it. But for my brownies, it is the greatest addition. Just so long as the brownies are crisp/crunch on the edges and ooey gooey in the middle. \n\nSmh. NTA",

Yes, I use cups n teaspoons etc for small recipes. \n\nAlso r/baking is a great subreddit plus r/food. Lol",
