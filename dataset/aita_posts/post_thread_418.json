  "post content": "\n\n\nMy husband and I have been having a long struggle with infertility. We have been getting treated and trying for a baby since 2017. But nothing worked! My husband is understandably devastated as he'd always wanted kids but never got the chance to be a father.\n\n\nHe's super sensitive aroubd the infertility topic. This my family knows. Days ago, we got together with family for dinner. All of a sudden, my sister and her husband announced that they were expecting. We were stunned, me and my husband I mean. As for the others they were thrilled. As everyone got up to congratulate them. My husband got up, pushed his chair to the side and walked out. They all stared at me but I got up and told my sister she messed up by announcing her pregnancy like this and with 0 consideration for my husband knowing how he feels about this topic. She got defensive saying his \"issues\" with the topic wasn't her problem and that she and her husband were fed up walking on eggshells around him. I called her selfish and cruel but she complained that he ruined their joy and that I made it worse by making a scene. I told her she shoukdn't have chose my parents house but she said I have no place to dictate what she does in our parents house. My mom asked me to go home and I went.\n\n\nIt's been horrible. My parents think I've reacted poorly and should apologize to my sister on both mine and my husband's behalf after the scene we made at their home.",

I get the feeling that the husband is hypersensitive about being infertile, which is why he immediately walked out of the house.  I think the sister feels like she has been very patient and \"walked on eggshells\" for so long, and that they could finally after 5 years, be pregnant without having to hide it.\n\nI also like how OP says her sister \"shouldn't have chosen my parents house\" when it is also the sister's parents house.  Why wouldn't you announce your pregnancy at your parents dinner table?",

One of the brothers with kids that had showed for the party has the home that we all gather at, enough rooms for all of us, centrally located, on the water. We didn't see my EXSIL or our brother again for a year and I was the only one he really texted even, but it was all shallow weather sure is nice shit. After a long while he just showed up at 4th of July to our surprise and said she was still refusing to get help and that he gave her divorce papers instead.
