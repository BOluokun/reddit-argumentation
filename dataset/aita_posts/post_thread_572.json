  "post content": "I woke up late for my 8:30 class and there was no way I\u2019d make it in time. My professor has to teach the same class back-to-back, therefore I got myself up to ask him if I could just sit in his other class to avoid getting marked absent. By the time I got to school, there had been a fire drill going on and I ran into a friend from the earlier class. She told me she was on her way to speak to our professor because she got to class late, the fire drill ended the class early, and she wanted to make sure she was marked down on the attendance sheet. Immediately I saw the opportunity in front of me. \n\n*My professor is not the best teacher in the world. No disrespect for teachers, but he does not do a good job at educating his students. He has us do mini projects for homework so we can spend the entire class sharing our work, rather than him teaching. We never learn actual content. This is a common teaching method at my school in France. Yes, their academic culture is different from the U.S., but I don\u2019t learn anything substantial here and honestly it stresses me out! \n\nOkay- back to the story. I walked with my friend to the classroom, and I stood beside her as she spoke to our professor. I was prepared to ask if I could sit in his next class but when my friend left, I was compelled to say the same thing she did, \u201cHi, I was late to class and want to make sure you marked me present. The fire drill interrupted class so I wanted to come back and double check.\u201d It was too easy. He said \u201cAre you sure you were in class?\u201d, and I said \u201cYes the metro shut down making me a little late\u201d. (This actually happened, seems to happen a lot in France). He interrupted and said, \u201cOh that\u2019s right okay what\u2019s your name?\u201d. I told him my name and he said \u201cvoila you were here!\u201d. After I left, I felt so guilty. Although I would have learned absolutely nothing if I stayed, maybe I\u2019d feel more fulfilled just by being there? Idk, I feel like an asshole lying to my professor. I feel like an ass hole going all the way to school and then just turning around as soon as I saw a way out. BUT, my best friend from home is visiting and we had plans to go to Disneyland today and we wouldn\u2019t have been able to go if I went to this class. AM I THE ASS HOLE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE A PIECE OF SHHHHITEEEE. \ud83d\ude28",

If you're able to keep up with the class, why does it matter if you show up for something you're not really benefitting from? You're not trying to overthrow the attendance checking system, but it's fine to get away with missing an occasional class without punishment.",
