  "post content": "Final Edit: I\u2019ve apologised to my GF and she\u2019s apologised back - we\u2019re talking about the situation right now and it seems like everything\u2019s okay now.\n\nTL;DR: Reached to my GF for support after my parents split up, she dismissed it and told me that lots of families have to go through something similar - I responded with \u201cf*ck you\u201d and we haven\u2019t spoken since. AITA?\n\nSo today my mother and stepdad split up after being together for 7/8 years. They have a daughter (my (half) sister) which made this harder. My stepdad was basically caught out to have cheated in late 2017 and my family is absolutely ruined.\n\nI told my girlfriend everything that happened and at first she was just sort of brushing everything off, but it was when she said \u201clots of family have to go through the same thing\u201d that I lost it. I told her \u201cf*ck you\u201d and we haven\u2019t spoken since. I said it out of hurt since I felt as if she was basically telling me to suck it up as lots of people go through the same.\n\nEither way, I do feel bad for saying it &amp; I personally think I could\u2019ve handled the situation better - but my main question really is whether she\u2019s an asshole for what she said or not. AITA?\n\nEdit: Not that it\u2019ll make a difference but me and my GF have a good relationship, we are very close and situations like this don\u2019t usually occur which is why it was such a shock to me when she said it.\n\nAnother Edit: Thanks for so many responses already, I\u2019m going to talk to her when she gets home. I\u2019m going to apologise for what I said.",
