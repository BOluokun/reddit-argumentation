  "post content": "I\u2019m 49m and I have 2 children, Jake (23) and Nikki (17). Their mother and I are divorced. I have full custody and she sends no support. Both of my kids are good kids and good students with good grades.\n\nJake got into his dream school but didn\u2019t get any scholarships. His undergrad school is one of the best school in our part of the country and it\u2019s expensive. I didn\u2019t want him to take out loans and have to carry a debt so I\u2019m paying for his tuition and living expenses. The total cost is roughly $50,000 a year. He\u2019s following in our family tradition and pursuing a career in dentistry (I\u2019m not a dentist but we have about a dozen dentists and oral surgeons in our family). I will also be paying for his dentistry degree. While I know it will be costly, I view this as a good investment as he\u2019ll have a starting salary of about $120,000 as a dentist in our area. If he decides to become an oral surgeon, his starting salary will almost double that figure.\n\nNikki is a senior in HS. Like her brother, she\u2019s a good student and will have a good chance of getting into her dream school but she has a low chance of getting any scholarships. Her dream school is also a very good one located in the middle of a very expensive city. Tuition and living expenses will be roughly $75,000 a year. The problem is that she\u2019s dreamt of being a teacher since she was little and have made it clear she will be an education major because she wants to be a middle school teacher. The other problem is that the salary for middle school teachers in our area is $48,000-$60,000 in our area. I fully realize that she can move and work elsewhere but I can\u2019t imagine there are many middle school teacher in the US making 6 figures. I don\u2019t view paying $300,000+ for a career that tops out at $60,000 as a wise investment. I told my daughter that the state school that\u2019s 2 hours away have a good education program and her instate tuition and living expenses will only be about $20,000 a year. I view paying $80,000 for a teaching degree as a much better investment. \n\nI\u2019ve tried discussing the matter with Nikki but she gets distraught every time I\u2019ve brought it up. She cries and accuses me of favoring Jake and being a sexist which is not true. I told her if she picks a major with a $100,000 starting salary, I\u2019ll gladly pay for her to go to her dream school but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m paying $300,000 for her to be a teacher. Now she\u2019s got family members involved. Some are staying out of it, some agree with me, and some are telling me not to play favorites. \n\nI feel terrible so I\u2019m beginning to doubt myself. Am I wrong?\n\nEdit to answer a recurring question:\n\nI thought I made it clear but apparently I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not limiting Nikki\u2019s education to $20,000 a year. I told her that\u2019s the max I\u2019m willing to pay for her education degree. I\u2019m more than happy to pay $75,000 a year if she picks another degree that will have a better return. For a while she thought about being a doctor and fell in love with England (we have family there) so I even offered to pay for her to go to Oxford which will be double the cost of her brother\u2019s tuition. But she\u2019s adamant about being a middle school teacher and I\u2019m unwilling to spend $300,000 that I worked hard for on an education degree.\n\nEdit to add: Oxford is hard to get into, I know that she won\u2019t be able to just walk in. I meant for her to apply and if she got in, I\u2019m willing to pay the cost of that school and the expense of living in an expensive country if her degree earning potential warrants that cost.\n\nEdit to answer a recurring question #2:\n\nWhy did I bring up the family tradition? Am I an elitist? Why does it matter?\n\nI brought it up because getting into dental schools and graduating is tough. The reason why we have so many in our family is because we help each other out. The dentists and oral surgeons in the family happily tutor and give valuable internship experiences that would otherwise not be available. People who pursued the dental career in our family have never failed because we don\u2019t allow them to fail. Last semester my brother spent weeks tutoring our niece to prepare her for her state board exam and she passed in one try.",

              "content": "The fact he didnt even THINK to just offer her the same money was silly. \n\nI personally agree that 300k for a teaching degree is wild, because unless youre at a prestigious school after graduation that sum would eat your salay for a half a decade, and teaching is like nursing- as long as you dont have serious violations and aren't a danger to people around you most districts will have a job for you. \n\nSo yes, a prestigious degree means significantly less outside of prestigious  circles and thats a rarity, but thats still not the point here. He could ALSO could have said that without being TA.\n\n**BUT** in the spirit of fairness he needs to offer both kid equal cuts. It just shows he doesnt think her career is worth the investment or he just favors his son unfairly, possibly both. Make it 40k a year for both of them (you can save up the difference for girl when she starts and he leaves) or whetever you can split of more or less.\n\nAnd as others have said, the return is making your kids have the best QOL not just high paying jobs- if she wants to be a teacher then let her teach.\n\n**EDIT: Yall probably gonna eat me alive, but I want to say it.**\n\nI THINK ITS YTA. HES TA. \n\n**But I also think hes right.**\n\nGrowing up my family was so destitute we had a basement apartment in the bronx (the armpit of nyc for foriegners) where I had so many rats and roaches hiding in and around my house that they would chew on my lips and tongue in my sleep to feed themselves off my dinner. I so frequently got chewed on it was nearly a daily basis, and people thought I had oral herpes because of it.\n\nI was fucking poor. I barely make 40k now and it feels like a dream not to have semi-sick, feverish sleep where i think I'm being eaten alive. 300k as a *sum* sounds comical even now, and likely would have saved my entire generation from poverty if it was **just** spend on college for everyone in my family in the same age group.\n\n300k on a teaching degree, even in New York (high cost of living for foreigners) is 6-7x the average quote you'd get from a decent college around here. Just the difference in that money that he could gift her for a downpayment on an expensive condo here or home, and she'd probably be paying well within her salary to maintain afterward.\n\n*To my eyes*, Its outlandish, wasteful, exorbitant to spend 300k on a degree with a return that low. Even veteran teachers rarely make 6 digits, and if she got a job in an environment where she could work at said prestigious schools, then it'd be worth it cost wise.\n\nBut if you got it, flaunt it. He **can afford it,** he just doesn't want to and thats the part that isn't fair. Because being realistic, she is as likely to get a position there without a networking reference as a kid would to get a scholarship to one of these schools unless shes at the very top of all her classes.\n\nThats for her to determine or for her to achieve. Beyond my judgement.\n\nHe should offer them both the same college funds and post graduate gifts and let them make their financial independence from there. Wash his hands.\n\nIf you don't want to be responsible for her going forward past college, lay the ground work now and hold your son to the same standard. College sum, graduation sum, trust fund, you're on your own after that.\n\nWhat I can't realistically see is her being the kind of person who spends 300k on a degree and suddenly be comfortable subsisting on 55-60k a year for the next decade or however long it takes for a prestigious university to take her in.\n\nI doubt she has and real scope of her lifestyle costs vs earning potential, and in reality I think thats a bigger problem than the 300k. She likely will still be dependent even with that huge cash investment in her \"independence\" and that means paying her a long time.\n\nThis is also beyond my judgement, but the likelihood im wrong is low enough I feel comfortable making the assumption.\n\nSo yes, this is a ton of money for something that doesnt need to be that expensive, and she could use it elsewhere for better purposes, but he should acquiesce and let her forge her own path to success.\n\nTLDR: I hink its a ridiculous sum to spend for what shes getting and the likelihood she will be independently capable to the lifestyle she prefers is **exceptionally low** even if YTA, but you should afford your kids the same opportunities.",

You aren\u2019t paying for your daughter to become a teacher whose career caps at $60,000 - you\u2019re paying for your daughter to have the credentials that give her OPTIONS throughout her life.

Hell, some of them may offer for him to work/partner at their practices, potentially inherit their practices, etc.  \n\nTeaching doesn't really work that way.  A teacher doesn't \"take over the family practice.\"  Having a family member already working in a district MAY help work there, but because it's a public institution run by the government and not by private individuals, there's simply not the same opportunity for daughter to take advantage of \"home cooking\" when it comes to her preferred occupation.  \n\nIt's actually an incredibly relevant point.  Son's degree will be more expensive, but due to the family connection, he's simply going to have more direct support and opportunities as a result.  After she graduates, daughter is going to be just another brick in the wall looking for a teaching job.  She's going to start out at the same low starting-teacher pay as everyone else (since school districts generally pay based on experience and depth of credentials).",

Even if you were never able to pay for it, taking out a 300k school loan for a career that starts at 60k and tops out at 80-90k would be a monumentally STUPID idea.\n\nIf you want to be fair, tell her you won't pay for her school, but you'll put the same amount you paid for your son into a downpayment for her first house. It's a net better investment for her life rather then a school that expensive for being a middle school teacher. If she still wants to do it it'll be on her to take a loan, and you'll have been fair money wise.",
