  "post content": "Title is slightly inflammatory, but oh well.\n\nMy brother (16) has a flat tire on his car. He isn\u2019t able to fix it until next week, so he has to use a pump that he plugs into his cigarette lighter to inflate it every time he drives. This takes about 5-10 minutes. So for small errands, like running to the gas station for milk or picking up our little sister from work, I (20m) have been letting him use my car, which has a little six inch pride flag on my dash board.\n\nYesterday, after he got back with milk, he announced \u201cI took down your pride flag.\u201d I asked why, and he said so that no one he knew would see him with it. I rolled my eyes, but whatever. And I just asked if he put it back up.\n\nHere is where he started to annoy me. He said \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want anyone to see me putting that up. It\u2019s in the passenger seat.\u201d\n\nI took a moment, before telling him that he either had to put it back up, or he couldn\u2019t use my car. He asked if I was serious, and I said yes. He has to respect my decorations or he can\u2019t use my stuff. I\u2019m not saying he has to drive around with it up, but I do expect him to replace it.\n\nAbout an hour later he borrowed it again, and I reminded him of our deal. He came back and I, probably in a ruder tone than I should have, demanded to know if he\u2019d put it back up. Our little sister (15) told me to chill, because it\u2019s not like it\u2019s homophobic and I shouldn\u2019t stop him from using my car over a piece of plastic. And frankly it wasn\u2019t until she said that that I realized how homophobic it is to refuse put someone else\u2019s decorations back up because you can\u2019t stand the thought of someone seeing you touch the scary gay piece of plastic.\n\n(He didn\u2019t stand it back up, he just placed it flat on the dash. But since it\u2019s tricky to properly place, I\u2019ll count it as good enough.)\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for demanding that  my brother put my pride flag back up if he uses my car? I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect my belongings to be respected, but my sister and brother think I\u2019m being a petty tyrant.\n\nEdit/Update: It seems the consensus is that I\u2019m NTA. And every single YTA comment boils down to either poor reading comprehension or \u2018the evil gays!\u2019. So that\u2019s good. Some of the ESH comments made good points.\n\nI have told my brother to get a patch kit. I\u2019ve even offered to show him how to find the hole in his tire. I can lead the horse to water but I can\u2019t make him drink. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s waiting on, but he\u2019s waiting on something that is next week.\n\nLet me re emphasize this sentence. **\u201dI\u2019m not saying he has to drive around with it up, but I do expect him to replace it.\u201d** Not once did I say he had to drive around with the pride flag flying. He has to reattach it to the vent when he\u2019s done if he wants to drive my car.\n\nI also don\u2019t think my siblings are raging homophobes. Yeah, my little brother was doing a homophobic action by refusing to put it up. But he\u2019s not a homophobe, just someone who enjoys pissing off his older brother. They\u2019re teenagers. And I can\u2019t put up a permanent pride sticker because I use my car for work, so all the pettiness will have to die here.",

Just not exclusively so, since there are times when I think people could be terrified of being seen with a gay flag regardless of their stance on gay rights and acceptance.",
