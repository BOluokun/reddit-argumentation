  "post content": "I (24F) live with my parents and always have done. Whilst I would love to move out and have a place of my own I am expected to stay with them until marriage due to their traditions and beliefs. I don\u2019t mind this too much because I\u2019ll probably be married in the next couple of years and while I pay towards the bills; it is not a lot in comparison to what I would do usually in this city. \n\nMy mother does most of the cooking in the house but I also cook a few times a week. A couple of months ago she started cooking dinner later - often finishing at 11pm - as my father apparently preferred to eat late and it seems to suit her too. Tbh it didn\u2019t really bother me too much and if I was hungrier any earlier I would just make myself something. \n\nCurrently we are experiencing a mice infestation. Now I am petrified and I can\u2019t tell you how anxious them being in the house makes me. I\u2019ve done the little I can do to try and deter them however my father refuses to get any work done to the house i.e blocking off spaces and holes that the mice can come in through.  He has plenty of money to do so and I have offered the money myself but he won\u2019t budge and there\u2019s so much I can do myself without his permission as it is his house. \n\nThe mice have taken a liking to the kitchen as mice do and often come out as soon as it is dark. I refuse to go in there and cook myself because of my phobia and on most days I just wait for my mum to finish cooking. I\u2019m also getting take away food when I can but that\u2019s not really a solution. Sometimes I\u2019m just sitting up in my room having not eaten in 9/10 hours because I\u2019m just waiting for dinner to be done. Cooking earlier doesn\u2019t work because of my job and I don\u2019t enjoy snacking either. I want to tell her to start cooking earlier. WIBTA if I did?\n\nEdit: I feel like people are focusing on the wrong thing here. When I said I don\u2019t mind living with my parents I really mean it! In fact I quite like it sometimes. Yes I did say I would love to move out but it\u2019s more of an eventual thing. Most of me wants to stay.  I can\u2019t afford to either. It suits my parents and me.",

If they want to continue to do the late dinner, you could ask for a compromise of having a healthy snack or something earlier in the day to tide you over.\n\nIt would also be good to press your dad by letting him know your fear and discomfort with the mice.  Part of the \"tradition\" that drives you to stay with family is largely around the care and protection of young women.
