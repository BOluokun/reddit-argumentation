You weren't there to disprove whether the floor was dirty or not. Your aunt did what you asked you to do, so you're the person who put them both in this situation. Next time you might wanna check with mom first to see if she's ok with aunt being in her house. Slightly YTA if you wanna claim that your mom is being a jerk because she was surprised and upset that her key was used by someone it wasn't meant to be used by, and trying to discredit her story as a lie based on your impression of how your aunt acts around you.",
