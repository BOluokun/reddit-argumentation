  "post content": "My son and his friend put up a tire swing in the yard for my grandchild.  I posted a picture of me swinging in it on Facebook.  My Aunt (Dad's sister) commented on it saying  \"I hate skinny people.\"\n\nI'm not one for Facebook drama so instead of commenting back I called her. I basically said that i don't talk about her watermelon ass so she shouldn't be talking about my weight. \n\nNow all my aunts, 5 of them, are mad at me because apparently skinny people can't be body shamed and that I should have told her first that I don't like those comments instead of straight out calling her out on her  watermelon ass like I did. \n\nI don't think I'm the asshole because it's not like I told her that I'm skinny because my sisters and I have always exercised more so we didn't inherit the family watermelon ass, but skinny is also something I didn't have to really work for. It's just how I am.\n\n\nETA: I accept my ESH verdict but I'm going to take that to mean I suck and so do all 5 of my aunts. If I'm going down, they're going down with me.",
