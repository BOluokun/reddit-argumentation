Arg1: NTA Their reaction is exactly why your mom set it up how she did! She knew your dad and well enough to know the money would not be yours and used for children that are not hers.
Arg2: Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking after the pressure campaign started. It was like wow, mom sure did know what could happen and she was right!

Arg1: NTA. But at that age, allowing them a mental health day once or twice a year is not going to hurt them academically, but can teach them the importance of self care. I let my son do it every now and then. He knows it is there if he really needs it. He does not abuse it. The kids in high school now have been preached to about mental health. Meanwhile, adults were taught to push through. A lot of adults don't know how to do self care. Instead, they keep pushing through until they crack. Kids learn they don't need a bandaid if the boo boo is not bleeding. Sometimes, we can't see the boo boo from the outside, and we need to trust them. ETA: Therapy is certainly in order.
Arg2: I half agree, half disagree with the mental health days. I think mental health days are important and should be incorporated into our lives. However, it really seems like OPs child is trying to abuse that and just doesn't want to go to school. The manipulative attitude, rudeness, and unwillingness to compromise makes it really seem like OPs child didn't want a mental health day, just a day with no school.

Arg1: Basically, you want your wedding dress to remain a dress. And your daughter would like to incorporate it into her wedding outfit, but she doesn't want it to be a dress anymore. If you allow her to alter it, it will still be a family heirloom -- but it won't be a vintage dress. I think you're within your rights to simply tell her that the dress has terrific sentimental value to you and you'd like it to remain intact. Make sure her suit looks awesome though. NTA
Arg2: I'm really torn on stuff like this, because a dress sitting in a closet for years, although a lovely memory, is just a waste (and I currently have mine hanging in my closet because I can't bring myself to get rid of it either). If OP's daughter doesn't use the dress, it's not likely that any grandchildren will use the dress either, it isn't an heirloom. I fully get OP and I think it's their dress and their right to keep it intact, especially since they lost their husband and it's a memory to a happy day. But she needs to explain that to the daughter. Personally, my dress had a belt and I wore a headband and I keep them separate so if my daughter or son want to use either in their weddings down the road they have some options for their something old/borrowed. Maybe OP has an element from the dress that can be utilized without hurting the integrity of the dress. She was married in the late 90s so dresses were still pretty fabric heavy back then.

Arg1: NTA, but hear me out, you need to change tactics. Your dad's connections put you in danger. Shut up, and QUIETLY plan your exit. You're what's called a "parentified child". It's not okay, how they've treated you. You need to be ready to never speak to them again. As soon as it's SAFE for you, as in you've made a PLAN and you've set everything up for yourself IN SECRET, just GTFO and mean it. You'll never get them to act different, but you can have a very different life. But seriously shut up about it, because again, do not underestimate the danger you are in.
Arg2: Prepare all your documents. Get them to your friends parents house. Now! They could use your info to take out loans in your name without you even knowing. Ruining your life before it's even gotten started.

Arg1: OP: Yeah if it were a matter of making ends meet I wouldn't have any issue, my dad has a credit card in my name that he can use whenever he needs to catch up on something and doesn't have the money. Dad is the breadwinner in our house, my mom pays for vacations and a couple utilities but my dad pays for the mortgage, groceries and most of the bills. Funny part is he doesn't want rent from me, it's my mom who wants it. It's part of why I am especially not keen on the idea. If they needed the money It wouldn't even be a question. They just got back from a 2 week cruise and are planning another one so definitely not even close to struggling. Yeah don't get me wrong the cheapest studio near me is closer to $900 and not the best area but still would have more privacy and independence for sure. Sorry if I missed a couple points I'm trying to reply to as many comments asking for context as I can.
Arg2: Ok now leaning toward YTA, because now I’m hearing juvenile complaining about your parents going on vacation, compounded with your juvenile comments about “it’s not as if they’re cooking and cleaning for me”, along with what has to be an unrealistic view of the rental market. You cannot rent an apartment for $600 a month. You imply that it would only be worth $600 to live at your parents’ house if they were cooking and cleaning for you; adults do not have someone else cook and clean for them, except for super rich people who pay thousands of dollars a month for housekeepers and personal chefs. Having someone cook and clean for you is what happens when you’re a child. I also don’t believe that you’ve been paying rent as you claim, since your mom’s message began with “rent is starting back up.” It sounds to me instead like you were living rent free while you were a temp, but now that you’ve been converted to a permanent employee your parents are charging you - a 25-year-old with a job that you say pays well - a far below market rate in rent to live at their house. I’m totally against the parents who kick their kids out when they turn 18 and stuff. That is terrible. But that doesn’t seem to be the case here.

Arg1: YTA. Don't undercut your wife's appropriate focus on your children's education. You guys are a team. You had an idea, you ran it past her, she said no. You made your case. She's not onboard. Taking your kids out of school on a whim to make their vacation one day longer is the sort of thing that requires both of your agreement. You didn't get it. They're getting spring break anyway. They'll have a chance to unwind. There are other ways to reward them for being good kids. Edited to add: I'm not sure Vegas is the most fun place for kids of that age to go, anyway. If you want to reward them, why not ask where they want to go.
Arg2: My problem with this is, why is it just her decision? Why does he have to give up just because she says no? Is he not an equal parent? I think a better compromise would be a half day. If they went for a half day, they could pick up the work they’re going to miss on their trip and do it all early so they can spend the holiday not worrying about makeup work. They would also have the time at home to pack their belongings that they’re taking with them.

Arg1: AITA for not choosing my parents as godparents for my newborn daughter because they didn't support my choice of legally adopting my step children before?
