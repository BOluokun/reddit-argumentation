  "post content": "I (f) own a piercing and tattoo studio and take pride in doing things properly. For those of you who don't know, piercing guns are generally very very bad. Although most people say \"I had mine done with a gun and they are fine\", it's still a poor way of piercing as a gun forces the jewellery through the lobe causing trauma to the skin, meaning that, if you decide not to have the piercing anymore, the holes are less likely to heal and the scars will be more thick and visible. Also, you cannot properly sterilise a piercing gun, and they break/get stuck often. It's also easier to pierce with needles as you can be 100% sure of where the hole is going to go. Because of this, I always pierce with needles and make sure my staff do too. \n\nMy sister is 18 and has a 5 month old baby girl. I love my sister and my niece to death but my sister was insisting on piercing her daughter's ears, and assumed I would do it. In my studio, we don't pierce babies because of the chances of the piercings being uneven when they grow up, and simply because as the owner I don't think it's fair to pierce someone who cannot give their consent to the procedure. There's also the added issues of babies not knowing it's bad to play with new piercings, the risk of them falling asleep on the piercing and hurting it, and I've also heard of parents not cleaning the piercings properly because they're \"worried about hurting the baby\". I told my sister, when she asked when she could bring my niece in, that I would not do it. \n\nShe said that if I don't, she'll go to Claire's and get them done there. I thought she was just trying to goad me into doing it to be honest, so I rolled my eyes and that was it (we've had chats before about why piercing at Claire's is bad). The next day she messaged saying she was in the mall and she was serious, and I have ten minutes to say I'll do it.\n\nI ignored her, so she called me, we had a small fight in which she insisted I do it, or Claire's does, so I eventually agreed. \n\nShe brought my niece into my studio, and I pierced her ears. It was actually quite a smooth process but my niece obviously cried. My sister actually paid me, which surprised me, and then she left, happy she got what she wanted. \n\nI feel awful, and unprofessional. This was a couple of weeks ago and the piercings are healing well. \n\nAITA?",

You pretty much got emotionally abused into doing it. Im sure your sister has bullied you like this before and trained you pretty well through your life to do what she wants.\n\nAnyone who says youre the asshole off their rocker honestly, because your sister is definitely for sure a giant asshole so at the very least everyone sucks here\n\nEdit: Listen y\u2019all, like five people said she was the asshole when I first posted this and NO ONE had said otherwise yet.
