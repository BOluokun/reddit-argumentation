  "post content": "Hey, so I\u2019m 26M and my sister is 19F. She\u2019s very autistic, like hand flaps, drooling, only talks about baby things like princesses, etc. Truth be told, I don\u2019t enjoy being around her. Sometimes my parents ask me to watch her, but I\u2019ll say no because of this (though I tell my parents it\u2019s because of work because I don\u2019t want to come off an ass.) I knew that I was having today as an off day so I couldn\u2019t wait to stay at home and just let loose, watch movies, maybe smoke a little weed.\n\nEarlier in the week my mom called and asked me if I could watch my sister today, I said no. Yesterday they called again to which I said no again because I want to relax on my day off like any guy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to not want to have something to do.\n\nThis morning I got a text from mom saying she\u2019d be back about 4:30. I thought it was for my dad or something since she hadn\u2019t been to my house in the first place to come back to. I called dad and he said he was at work so that confused me. I looked out the window for mom\u2019s car or something and it turns out she left my sister on the porch. I called mom and pointed this out to her, she said \u201coh yeah, it won\u2019t be for long.\u201d It was about 11 so 4:30 was easily five hours. I said I wasn\u2019t looking after her so someone better come get her. I kept my word and didn't have her in my house at all.\n\nWell eventually my mom showed up at my house and banged on the door, chewed me out with some \u201chow could you\u201d speech about not looking after the sister I said I wasn\u2019t watching. I got another earful when they went home because I guess sister defecated in her pants during the time she was on my porch, which sucks but I didn\u2019t cause this.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen mom that upset and it has me wondering if I was the asshole for not watching my sister when my mom presented me with her. I just wanted to enjoy my time but I wonder if I did wrong.",

I get that it\u2019s not his legal responsibility to care for his sister, but his parents may very well be in a caregiving position until they themselves are in need of care. A lot of parents are literally driven to the end of their rope because they don\u2019t get sufficient support, financial or otherwise.

TONS of women who are nonverbal are snatched up and hurt severely. even without jumping to that conclusion, if her behavior is as op says it is, she could have hurt herself by walking out into the middle of the street.  \n\n\ni am not blaming him for having a sister. i said that its not his sisters fault that hes possibly being treated like a third parent and he shouldnt be taking it out on her.  \n\n\nand about the \"how many 26 year old men do you know who like princesses\" thing, it doesnt exactly matter, because i know plenty of 26 year old men with little sisters who dont treat it like its some sort of 'baby interest' . i know plenty of grown men who respect their little sisters interests and op is simply not doing that here. there wasnt any need to bring the sisters interests into it in the first place. it doesnt add anything to the story, it doesnt tell us what she acts like other than \"shes into princesses and i think thats an interest for baaaaaaabies\". there was no reason to bring that into play.  \n\n\nthe mother is also at fault here - i said that in my comment too. the way op talks about his sister makes it sound like he, at least to some extent, dislikes or resents her. which would make sense if op was being parentified, but again, op never says that in his post. he just says hes asked to take care of his sister sometimes and he says no because he doesnt like her.  \n\n\nmom is bad too for leaving sister on the doorstep of someone who wants nothing to do with her, but absolving op of all faults because of the inference that he was parentified and/or abused is very very odd to me. abused and parentified people can still be at fault, and its my opinion that op is partly at fault. mom essentially abandoned her disabled child at the doorstep of someone who didnt want her, which is bad, but once she was there it literally wouldnt have taken any time out of his day to call mom, sit on the porch with sister and be on his phone while looking up every once in a while to make sure shes still there",

                  "content": "Well your post makes it clear you think that his sister is his responsibility. If he took any kind of responsibility for her he would be binding himself to BE responsible for her. By not accepting responsibility for her he was protecting himself from being abused from his mom. And you called him an asshole for it. \n\n*\" how dare you insinuate that im calling OP an asshole for .. \"protecting himself from being abused\"*\n\nSo yes, you called him an asshole for protecting himself from being abused by his mom. \n\n*a lot of people are making a LOT of assumptions*\n\nAs did you when you said  *can i ask why you hate your sister?*\n\nHe never said he hated his sister. He said he doesn't like her. I don't think he cares enough about her to hate her. Which seems to make sense with how his mom is treating him. \n\n*i am not blaming him for having a sister. i said that its not his sisters fault that hes possibly being treated like a third parent and he shouldnt be taking it out on her.*\n\nHe absolutely did not take it out on her. At ALL. There are people in this world, as horrible as they are, that WOULD have taken it out on her, he did not.   \n\nLet's see. Did he hit her? NO. Did he verbally abuse her? NO. Did he push her? NO. Did he throw things at her? NO. Did he harass her? NO. Did he call other people over to harass her so he could watch? NO. Did he yell at her for being there? NO.  He in NO WAY took it out on her.\n\nYou are confusing taking it out on her with not taking responsibility for her. Letting her in the house, staying outside with her, ALL are ways of taking responsibility for her. He did not do that. Because he was not going to take responsibility for her, that does NOT make him an asshole. If he had taken it out on her, punched her, screamed at her etc, THAT would have made him an asshole. All he wanted to do was STAY OUT OF IT. And he did. He EVEN was kind enough to call him mom and tell her she needed to pick him up, even though he had already told her he wasn't going to watch her days before. He didn't have to. BUT HE DID.  \n\n*TONS of women who are nonverbal are snatched up and hurt severely. even without jumping to that conclusion, if her behavior is as op says it is, she could have hurt herself by walking out into the middle of the street.*\n\nI'm sure that what you are saying is true. That is not the issue. The issue with this is that you are stating that this happening is HIS responsibility, instead of being upset that his mom set her up to have this happen to her. You should have been talking about being pissed at his mom for this INSTEAD OF HIM. Because HE had nothing to do with it.   \n\nOr is he also responsible for all women, men, etc, who might show up at his door and get snatched?  He is no more responsible for his sister than them. \n\n*but once she was there it literally wouldnt have taken any time out of his day to call mom, sit on the porch with sister and be on his phone while looking up every once in a while to make sure shes still there*\n\n5 hours. That would have pretty much been his whole day. Because he DID call his mom. And she refused to pick her right back up. Maybe you missed that part. \n\n *I called mom and pointed this out to her, she said \u201coh yeah, it won\u2019t be for long.\u201d It was about 11 so 4:30 was easily five hours.* \n\nHe had plans for his day off. And having to babysit his sister was not part of them. Which is why he said NO to begin with. \n\n*I knew that I was having today as an off day so I couldn\u2019t wait to stay at home and just let loose, watch movies, maybe smoke a little weed.*\n\nDoes that sound like being forced to hang on the porch and listen to her while looking at his phone all day? No, no it does not. \n\nYour making a lot of assumptions for someone who is 1) pissed at other people because you *think* they are making assumptions, and 2) seems to have problems with reading comprehension. \n\nHere's what it sounds like. You had an autistic brother and think that because you were ok with it, everyone should be. Yes they can be vulnerable. But that is the responsibility of the parents, and all anger about NOT giving a shit about them should be direct that way, to the parents. \n\nSome people are excellent with siblings like that and dearly love them, some hate them and the situation they had to grow up with (read other posts) and there are so very many more that are in the spectrum in between. You just sound pissed off at the brother that he is not more interested, and loving about his sister. How he feels about his sister is not something YOU get to dictate. It is feelings HE has because of what HE had to go through. You won't know what happened to him. It's nothing he shared and none of your business.    \n\nBut let's recap shall we? He did NOTHING to hurt her. NOTHING. He cared enough about her to call his mom to tell her to pick her up. So no negatives and a positive for calling his mom. Where on earth do you get he is the asshole for this? He even let her stay on his porch. And lets not mention how all this emotional, arguing, fights and being yelled at affected HIM. Because, he doesn't count, to you. Only someone that he had no part in bringing into this world. Someone who, again is NOT his responsibility. \n\nAnd do you HONESTLY believe that if he did do anything that was taking responsibility for her, letting her in, sitting on the porch with her, etc, his mom wouldn't have turned right around and pulled this shit again? Because after what happened that day, I'm pretty sure she isn't going to try to screw over him like this anymore. \n\nHe's 26 years old, living on his own, and his parents are still trying to abuse him. That needed to stop.  \n\n Call the cops and ask them what they would have been able to do if he had let her in, taking responsibility for her in the process.",

But under no circumstances would I have let her in, and watched her. \n\nPeople in my family have tried to pull that type of shit on me before. I remember once about 15 years ago, when I was newly married to my first wife, I was telling them (both her family and mine at the time) how I really wasn't comfortable around babies, and I did not feel comfortable babysitting. So my ex-wife's mother's solution was to get everybody in the family to abandon me when I was taking a nap, to wake up to the (my ex wifes sisters) baby crying. No one was in the house and I was panicking. Everybody thought it was a great laugh. You know it's not a great laugh? Thrusting people into situations like that, where you be coming unwilling guardian/babysitter against your will. It's infuriating, it's insulting, and it's an injustice to is what it feels like. so I can definitely understand this person being like \"fuck you I'm not doing this\" And leaving her outside as a big fuck you to the mom. I bet leaving her out there in his mind was more of a punishment towards his mother than it was towards his sister, however she was definitely mistreated here.  Especially with them already saying they have a strained relationship with both of those family members, is it really a wonder that he doesn't care? I'm willing to bet the mom has pulled shit like this their entire life.\n\nSo yeah I don't think that she should have been left outside. She's mentally handicapped. She's literally just a victim here. OP should have treated this situation a little better in regards to her.\n\n\nBut I'm also bewildered that so many people here think that just because they're related, that he should somehow be responsible for her out of sympathy or pity or something.",

She knew exactly how her son felt or else she wouldn't have sneakily left her very vulnerable daughter on the front porch without even explaining anything. She deserves anything that comes her way.\n\nThat being said, yeah I still can't fully forgive OP for this - as you said it's very likely he did this out of spite towards the Mother rather than the Sister, but it did lead to a very serious situation where the sister was mistreated because no one seemed to care about what would happen to her. \n\nIt didn't bother me that much that they were related, but the only reason I put weight to that fact is that through them being related, he knew exactly what her condition was, and how vulnerable she was.

I really couldn't care for a high needs disabled person, and I say that as a person with disabilities (just nowhere near this level). I'd feel stressed, sick, exhausted and on the verge of wanting to jump out a window if forced into such a situation (granted I have pain and sensitivity issues, but I think emotional inabilities to cope are just as valid for people). I can only stand the noise and mess of my gorgeous adorable niece for a few hours at a time, and I love her greatly, and I then needs hours of rest. \n\nSome people can't cope with this stuff, although I think there's a big element of dislike and/or detachment in OPs case too. He clearly doesn't love his sister, but that doesn't necessarily make him an AH either. We don't know how things were in the family growing up, and him never developing a positive attachment to her may be understandable depending on that.\n\nI would've threaten the mother that she had to return immediately though, or the authorities would be called if she wasn't back within 30 minutes. I would've gone out to ensure sister was fine to, and waited with her at least.",

                      "content": "I think you are being unfair to OP, you don't know what his journey has been.  I can imagine that a sibling like this would have resulted in a lot of things that OP couldn't do as the sister's needs were always prioritised.  He may have also had to watch his sibling on multiple occasions previously and been parentified.  I've been through phases where I have felt like he has towards some of my family members.\n\nI grew up with a couple of profoundly disabled relatives.  My brother also was disabled.  My family would have never dumped them on my doorstep.  The profoundly disabled relatives had care homes sorted out for adulthood.  I've visited them and we used to have them home for family events/weekend.  \n\nI remember once my sibling wasn't supervised by my parents and he drew all over my walls, ruined many of my clothes and my possessions.  Many normal childhood experiences were altered because he wouldn't cope or had to be removed because he was chucking a tantrum.  Many experiences were stressful and I would often have major life moments altered because my sibling's needs would trump mine.  For example I had birthday cakes wrecked before childhood parties and I was just supposed to roll with it because he was \"special\".  He'd want to interrupt and participate in things which didn't involve him and my parents would struggle to get someone to watch him.  It isn't easy growing up with a sibling like this and quite frankly I don't blame OP for feeling the way he does.  Is he supposed to accept his sibling being dumped on him forever?  What about when he has a partner? What about when he has his own children?\n\nThe experience of trying to follow a very active person around and take stuff off them or prevent them from touching or destroying stuff is not fun.  Neither are the tantrums when people are fully grown.  I am half the size of my brother and I have been assaulted by him too many times to count.  Eventually you just get sick of being punched and think I'm not subjecting my kids and family to this.  Yes disabled people are vulnerable to assault, but you don't know how destructive OP's sibling might be.  One of my female relatives had broken a carer's jaw before, so my family were always careful.  I also had the experience as a child of being \"cuddled\" by one of my cousins for 30 minutes while my family tried to convince her to let me go.    They had to wait for her to get bored of me, it was a terrifying experience.  My point is that it is not just watching, like you would do with children, it is an exhausting experience of moving things out of reach, locking things up, toileting, cleaning up after they make a mess and dealing with tantrums when they don't get what they want (think assault, property damage, mess).  \n\nHis mother created this situation, he demanded she fix it, she refused.  She is the one who left the sibling on the porch without an agreement for supervision.  His mother put her at risk of being assaulted and not properly supervised, not OP.  She ignored the requests to pick her up and didn't come for 4 hours.  If what she had to do was really important then OP's father should have taken time off work.  \n\nOP's parents need to sort out their own solution.  My advice to OP is to remove himself completely as an option for the family.  This will likely mean moving a few hundred km away or getting housemates (then you can say the home environment isn't suitable).",

And that as the sister wasn\u2019t able to control her bowels or indicate that she needed to use the bathroom she pooed in her underwear. This means that he would have to attend to intimate care as well as the personal care that is involved when a person is drooling. And I think most people here are lying to themselves and us if they say that if someone was dumped on their doorstep they would be more than happy to do that kind of work. Nta",
