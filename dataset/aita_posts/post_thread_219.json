  "post content": "My ex wife and I have a healthy relationship for the kids and for each other as adults. We have always both been great parents, 50/50 custody, avoided the \"nastiness\" we've always heard about in other people's split-ups since divorcing and have always been very helpful and civil to each other and the kids.\n\n10 years have gone by and it's been incredibly nice, peaceful, and healthy for the kids and ourselves. We all go to my son's football games together, save eachother seats at my daughter's recitals, etc; and in a word..things have been \"perfect\" for a decade until this past year.\n\nMy Ex's spouse (call him Robert) has been having some anger issues and degrading my children, calling them stupid/worthless, screaming in their faces, breaking their things, punching holes in doors/walls, etc; losing control without provocation and the children are afraid to be there, asking if they can stay with me permanently. He is not laying his hands on them, but the kids fear he will one day and I share their concern. \n\nMy daughter is 14 and my son 12 and my daughter has Googled her options and is threatening to petition the court to make the choice for them both and has asked me to support her decision.\n\nSpeaking with their mother and Robert about this, I have tried to hold my daughter's choice off more than once (while feeling awful) to give her the opportunity to sort her household perils. Each time, she has decided to make it work since he is their only provider, doesn't make much, she has no family in the state, they share 1 vehicle due to an unforeseen repair, in mid 40's starting over with a toddler and working to improve their situation, etc; I am more than sympathetic to her desperation to make it work.\n\nHe is on meds, sees a counselor (all things their mother required after an incident screaming at the kids until they were crying and shaking and couldn't even tell me legibly what had happened) but chance after chance it has not stopped and each time they they call begging me to pick them up before quickly getting off the phone for fear of being discovered.\n\nI have decided that I am telling my ex wife this weekend that I will support my daughter in her petition regardless if it ruins our co-parent progress from the last decade because I cannot let my kids think I condone what's happening or will fail them when they ask for my help **...and I feel like a HUMONGOUS asshole** for doing this to my ex wife who's in a very tough situation with seemingly no exit which no doubt makes me feel like I'm kicking her while she's down. Jesus, it feels awful to even type what's about to happen, but I fear what could possibly happen to my children if I allow it to go any longer.\n\nI've lurked here for a while and enjoyed reading everyone's posts but knew that one day I would probably be the asshole, so here it is.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

The fear, the terror, the degradation, humiliation, threats, screaming, all far worse than a wallop.

Physical, sexual, emotional, forced substance, neglect, there's all sorts of types that each have awful effects on people, and there's often multiple types of abuse at once (although this doesn't mean a single type of abuse is \"better\"). Emotional abuse is effectively everything bad someone can do to another person without physically touching them. Threats, making someone live in fear or walk on eggshells, blaming them for bad things that weren't actually their fault, name calling in the extreme, insults, all of it. Humans are emotional beings, and they thrive on feeling safe and happy, as well as having a physically safe environment (this is where physical abuse and neglect would come into play), mazslows hierarchy of needs is a good way of looking at this. \n\nIn this case, the stepdad is using physically dangerous/abusive behaviour towards other objects, as a threat to the children, along with other forms of bullying and emotional abuse. The emotional abuse is awful in itself because humans depend so much on their social and emotional aspects of life, and these are children who are still developing these, so they'll possibly find it harder to get over. Along with emotional abuse which includes the threats, he's showing that he has the power to follow through with the threats, making them physically unsafe and reinforcing the emotional abuse. \n\nI don't want to bring personal stories into this, but I'm interested in you saying the physical stuff in your home was a result of your behaviour. Phrases like \"you caused this\", \"this is your fault\", \"you made me do this\", or generally using someone's mediocre actions as an excuse for very awful, very serious reactions (physical abuse, in your case) is absolutely emotional abuse. You were blamed for the things that someone else did to you, and this was wrong. If you were a child, a child's behaviour will NEVER EVER excuse an adult's abusive actions, purely because of the difference in development. Your dad not being able to control his temper DOES NOT excuse anything physical he did to you.",

I honestly didn't suspect it was any worse than she told me because he was always a really good guy, as far as all of us knew.. It was odd but we have always had good communication and I trusted her the way she wouldve trusted me if the kids had ever called her about being punished, which I dont remember ever happening. Shes a good person and a great mom and always has been, but looking back I don't think she wanted me to know how bad it was (what she and the kids were going through there) because she was thinking it was fixable and was probably also overcome with shame/fear.\n\nIt was recently when Sarah mentioned petitioning the court that I knew it was more than just \"a stepdad yelling\" sometimes. We talked and she told me a lot, but still not everything. She assumed I knew the whole time because her mother knew and of course we talk..but I didn't. Even after that talk, I remember thinking \"Wow, Robert is an asshole.\" But not enough was shared that I knew just how bad he was to them. Captured enough that I knew he was an asshole sometimes but not abusive.\n\nI told their mother and gave her the opportunity to get his \"being an asshole\" under control while I hold off our daughter from doing something awfully drastic(even though I was proud of her for doing the research, but not surprised since I've always pushed her to question everything and change anything about the world that shes willing to put in the work for..and she tries, oh does she try), and told the kids that they need to tell me when something like that happens regardless of what anyone else wants.\n\nThey have been calling me to tell me and now I know its serious, spoke with their mother who broke down and told me how bad he was..the therapy, the hole punching, the time where they were crying because of how bad he was to them, how she's tried and tried and is doing her best to protect them/change him, everything. I felt for her...very seriously but also know now that he needs to go or they need to go.\n\nI'm starting with them, literally right now.\n\nP.S. I was over the moon impressed at what my daughter had researched and told her so. I'm very proud of her and her brother and they know it. Theyre both very independent and I push them to be. They also now know that I'm with them and we will get through it together, and that I'll shield them from any consequences or nonsense and help them through the entire thing. This choice originated with them and their freedom from this will be their accomplishment, (with the help they need) since even if they turned back now, I will still pursue either him/them being gone. I just hope their mother is as great of a mother as I believe she is, because if so, this will be easier and the kids will certainly be happier even if its tougher for her to pursue.\n\nThank you all so much for the outpouring of support.",

She's still a great mother but she is a victim and is in a situation where it's very difficult for her to see clearly what the right choices are. Read up more on the psychological effects of abuse, especially for the spouses. I'm not saying it's okay for the children to stay in that, but rather that her letting them be in that situation isn't a reflection on who she is as a mother, but rather a reflection on how bad the abuse has gotten and the hold he has on her. I am 8 years out from an emotionally abusive relationship and it blows my mind how clouded I was...I could not think clearly or rationally, he completely changed my process of logical thinking. It was YEARS before I completely made it out of that fog, and I was only with him for a few months. Learning about what happens to the victims and why they stay will greatly help you navigate all this, and help your children as well. Even if your ex doesn't choose to contact a domestic violence shelter herself, at the very least you should for yourself and your children. They will have resources for classes and counseling to both help them work through their own trauma and for all of you to understand it better AND how to best support your ex wife.\n\nEdited to add: I don't want to make that sound purely critical.

I almost want to say YTA for letting this go on for so long without doing anything, honestly, but that\u2019s not the question. It seems as if this man is violent and as their father, you should be doing everything in your power to get the kids out of that situation. If you don\u2019t get your children out of that situation by any means necessary ASAP, YWBTA and you would be an awful father. \n\nComing from someone who came from an emotionally abusive household, you have no idea the amount of psychological trauma he could be inflicting on your children from his abuse. Get them out of that household and into therapy.",
