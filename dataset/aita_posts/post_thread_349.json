  "post content": "So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we\u2019re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven\u2019t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what\u2019s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the \u201csecrets\u201d I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying \u201cJust don\u2019t let mom find out\u201d The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out \u201cI cheated on my wife...\u201d At first it didn\u2019t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife\u2019s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They\u2019ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) \nHe told me life has been good to him now and he\u2019s just thankful things have finally worked out. \n\nAs stated before I hate cheaters and I\u2019ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it\u2019s the right thing to do, especially because I\u2019ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it\u2019s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don\u2019t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?\n\nTLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she\u2019s a close friend. WIBTA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong.\n\nSecond Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",

If they dont split then they may stay together just for the kid and the general relationship turns bitter and resentful. Or the chance the wife forgives and all is ok.

Brother relationship is also intact.\nYet the brother has some moral issue with something that really isn't their business. \n\nAre we expecting the other brother to tell his brothers employer that hes been taking illegal drugs? \n\nI dont like it when both parties are involved in a sort of secrets exchange. Yet one person decides they will take the moral high ground, ignoring the fact that they have also admitted to some bad shit. Yet feel that they can trust their brother not to snitch, while snitching themselves. \n\nGet off your high horse. Holding your brother to something he did 4 years ago, that he also admitted was wrong. Is just crappy in my opinion.\n\nThis doesnt feel like a completely logical response. Are you jealous of your brother? Have you had some bad experiences people cheating on you? If so, dont reflect your bad experiences onto your brother.",

The most OP should do is try to convince the brother to confess to his wife otherwise, he'd just be adding more pain to everyone for an issue that has no currently existing negative impact. \n\nI think cheating that's currently happening needs to be headed off because telling allows the partner being cheated on to brace themselves for conflict and pain rather than facing it all at once if they find out for themselves once the situation blows up.\n\nPast cheating on the other hand, no longer has that potential. Pain and conflict can only come from the people who know about it.

This isn't just someone copying off a test in 4th grade. These are majorly complicated situations with too many circumstances for anyone on the outside to judge.\n\nHe might need to confess just to stop feeling guilty, and like everyone else is saying, he risks destroying his entire family just so he can feel better about himself and sleep at night.\n\nBut on the flip side... maybe the wife would be understanding if she knew. Most Redditors' first response to any type of cheating is to launch a scorched earth campaign where the victim needs to start a new life under a new name, but a lot of people work through it no differently than a drug habit or gambling problems or some other major fuck up. \n\nAnd on the other flip side of that... maybe the wife cheated once while doing all that traveling too and she's keeping it to herself. \n\nNone of us are really in any position to judge whether the brother does or doesn't confess. But we can pretty much all agree that OP needs to keep his nose out of this. Telling the SIL about this does nothing but appease his own sense of self-righteousness.",
