  "post content": "Hi, first time posting on this sub, tl;dr below.\n\n*dlc = downloadable content\n\nLet's give you guys little context here, I've been selling in game items for a specific game for a while now, and i met someone selling game codes ( dlc's and stuff's, instead of in game items) for the same game, and it's not really a big deal for me since I've started first, and we have totally different target customers. At times I even refer some of my potential customers to him or even buy some codes from him for my regular customers. (I did get lower price from him)\n\nA new game appeared recently and he started selling dlc's for that game, sadly there's no in game items for the game , only dlc's.\n\nSo, will I be the A-hole if I start the same business as him?\n\nOne more thing to note is that the current game i am doing my business on is slowly dying down. So I am actively searching for other means of income.\n\ntl;dr friend started selling dlc's for a new game, WIBTA if i follow suit?",

It sucks that you will be competing to each other if you built a relationship before, but that's just how business is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I didn't know people could sell DLC's for games that weren't published by them. Just out of curiosity  (if you want to disclose it), what games are you talking about?",
