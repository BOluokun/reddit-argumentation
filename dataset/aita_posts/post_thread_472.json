  "post content": "It happened yesterday, but I'm still thinking about it, so I need an external opinion.\n\nIn December 2021 I had a surgery for a breast cancer. It was in the very early stage, the surgeon removed it completely, but I still had to do radiotherapy sessions and many follow-up visits.  \nYesterday I had the visit with the breast specialist. He was in the examination room with two residents. These rooms have an examination table and a curtain that can be pulled to prevent the patient from being visible from the corridor, should someone open the door (this is relevant for what happened).\n\nAs usual, I sit on the table and took off my shirt and bra. The curtain was open but I just didn't notice.  \nBut suddenly the doctor yelled at one of the residents, *\"Move and pull the curtain. What if someone opens the door? Do I always have to say everything?\"*  \nSuddenly the mood became very tense and I tried to ease it with a joke, *\"It's not a problem, doctor. By now, half of the hospital staff has seen my boobs. Actually, I could open an OnlyFans when I'm here.\"*  \nThe residentes smiled, the doctor didn't. On the contrary, he became even more tense, abrupt and angry.\n\nWhen I went back to my workplace, I told boss and coworkers what happened. A coworker suggested not to think about it too much, the doctor was probably in a bad mood.  \nBut boss said I was an a-hole, because the doctor wanted to be courteous and protect my privacy, then he was right to get mad at the resident because they have to learn what to do without constant inputs, and that with my joke I undermined the doctor's authority in front of the residents.\n\nI just wanted to ease the tension, but maybe my boss is right? AITA for making a joke?",

I replied, \"Yeah sure, but next time we charge the entrance fee.\"That time everyone laughed, including the doctor.",

Both for my sanity, and because treating someone who doesn't cause tension makes things easier and go more smoothly for everyone. I'd rather the staff laugh along with me than be put on edge by me, if that makes sense?\n\nRecently had a big cancer scare and some really unfun and painful procedures. Turned out not to be cancer, but to be something they'd never seen before lol\n\nIt was, well, excruciatingly painful and I couldn't be given anesthetics.. The surgical theatre was pretty full of chuckles, even after I nearly passed out when I stood up- 'it's ok, I promise if I pass out I'll make sure not to land on any expensive equipment or damage the floor with my head, it's all good\". Surgeon laughing, nurse kind of alarmed, other staff just snickering. That's how you want to leave a painful experience if you can. I'd rather laugh than cry.",
