  "post content": "My gf and I have a child, due to financial issues we haven\u2019t been able to live together until now. She\u2019s been vegan about a year, and wasn\u2019t when we met, I have always been an omnivore and never suggested that would change. Now that we found a place, she now says that she doesn\u2019t want to live with me if I don\u2019t agree to go vegan. I responded with [this](https://i.imgur.com/rd4a9Ck.jpg) after my frustration reach epic levels AITA?\n\n**Edit**: our child is being raised vegan against my wishes but in the interest of compromise I leave it alone and made sure our child eats as complete a diet as possible. \n\nCurrently I only eat meat 2-3 days a week at most. I already agreed not to eat meat around here, my meat eating at \u201cour\u201d place would be limited to when she isn\u2019t there. \n\nI forgot to mention I have a child from a previous relationship that will be living with us, and that child is expected to go vegan as well.\n\n**Edit 2**: I agree with anyone that says my response was immature and counterproductive.\n\n**Update 1: we spoke and this summarized what I said:**\n\n\u201cYesterday doesn\u2019t sit well with me, your attitude towards it is controlling, and the fact you\u2019re not willing to even explore compromises is troubling. For instance, the few times I eat or cook meat could be done when you aren\u2019t home, I could get a small bar fridge to store meat, there\u2019s a million solutions that could have been discussed if you really wanted this to work. Your attitude surrounding it is controlling and unreasonable, I am asked to make incredible sacrifices because you\u2019re unable to compromise, or unwilling to. This will become a pattern, because you know I want this more than you, and you won\u2019t have to compromise cause I\u2019ll cave to have our family.\n\nYou have a right to state how you feel, as I do. If you choose to ignore my feelings entirely up to you. But the lack of communication about this isn\u2019t going to change anything. I want you and this family, but I\u2019m not rolling over and changing every time you decide you believe in something else, compromise is a two way street, and if we aren\u2019t going to walk it together as equals, in ideas, feelings, respect, and communication, then we say goodbye now. \u201c\n\n**Addition: I feel like I should add this reply I made to a militant vegan here **\n\n~~https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d2bg73/_/ezuc01f/?context=1~~\n\nI replied to the wrong comment and now I can\u2019t find it.\n\n**Update 2:** All she\u2019s said to me is \u201cI\u2019m dreaming of a future that I won\u2019t have. \u201c not sure what that means but I don\u2019t want to go down any more rabbit holes today. I think I\u2019ll try tomorrow evening to talk to her, I\u2019ll give her time to consider my words abs to collect her thoughts. Right now I want to think about everything that\u2019s been said here, specifically about my younger child being vegan, my family, what\u2019s best for everyone, and most importantly what kind of future do I see with her right now.  I\u2019ve read every comment, and this has turned into a very spirited debate. I believe there\u2019s merit to reducing meat intake for your health and for the environment, but I don\u2019t believe in extreme knee jerk reactions to anything. I have reading to do..\n\n**thoughts:** I am not criticizing vegans, and in the reply (to the wrong comment) that\u2019s causing me to get hate mail, I was referring to a specific subset of vegans, I would have expressed similar sentiments to a religious fanatic that was forcing his or her beliefs to me. \n\nI support her right to live the life she wants, and to eat what she wants. I want the same accommodation. \n\nWas I the asshole here? IMHO Yes in some ways I was. Is she the asshole for the ultimatum? Possibly. What I know for sure is I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever understand how this \u201clifestyle\u201d and diet is a reasonable justification to change the nature of the family at its core. \n\nSome have called me a pushover, that may be true, but I\u2019m trying my best to navigate waters that are unfamiliar to me, and to make the best decisions for me and my family.\n\nI am reading most of your comments, and to those who say I\u2019m being intolerant, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m seeking compromise. To those who say a child should be raised as a vegan, I agree and have from the start, that choice was made unilaterally and the safe guards and information gathering  we agreed to hasn\u2019t happened.",

The gf thinks that consuming animal product is morally wrong. Wanting your spouse (and your family household) to behave in a way that is at least vaguely in alignment with your own morality is understandable. That's not the issue. The issue is that she started trying to enforce this after they had a child. Asking your partner to change their behavior to fit your morals is a thing that needs to be done before your lives are permanently entangled through children or marriage. And if that's not possible because your morals changed afterwards, you got to give a bit more leeway than at the beginning of a relationship.",
