  "post content": "Last Wednesday 9/22 I asked a coworker if she wanted to go to our local amusement park, they had decorated the park for the Halloween season and I thought it might be a good idea to ask her if she wanted to go, we usually talk for while when I\u2019m getting off and she\u2019s just getting in so I thought she might like me, when I first asked, I specifically asked \u201care you doing anything next Saturday and want to go out to the amusement parking and get dinner?\u201d She instantly lit up and and said yes, that she had nothing going on and that sounded like fun, and she would be down to go, I said cool I\u2019ll hit you up later in the week about it.\n \nI text her that same Friday 9/24 about our plans, no response, was left on delivered, but she can still post on her Snapchat the whole weekend, first red flag \ud83d\udea9. Then Monday rolls around, and she sees me at work and didn\u2019t even try to talk about our plans, so I hit up a mutual coworker and asked her if she was mad at me, all she said was no, she just gets busy, which is understandable but our job we are constantly on our phones, no reason she can\u2019t get back to me super fast, I\u2019m able too. \n\nSo Monday after work she finally hits me back up apologizing for the lack of response, still says she\u2019s down to go, i said cool me too, Thursday rolls around and she texts me what she should bring and what time we should meet on Saturday, I told her to meet me at 4pm and bring a jacket and maybe some snacks if she wanted and we would get food after, she said that was ok. \n\nSaturday morning when I\u2019m at work she texts me this big paragraph that basically says she doesn\u2019t want to go if her 3 sisters can\u2019t go, her parents were forcing her to take them even though she\u2019s 24 years old but we could go off and do our own thing once we got inside, I asked her if she could go with them another time, I wanted it to be just us, and she said if they can\u2019t go she won\u2019t go. So I said that was ok, her mom had already bought their tickets a while ago and \u201cthis was the perfect time to use them\u201d\ud83d\ude44. \n\nI get there at 4pm, like we had talked about 3 times at this point, and text her saying I was there, and asked if they were close, a few minutes later I get a text saying they were running late and would be there around 4:40, I said cool I\u2019ll just go get a beer and hangout and wait, 4:40 rolls around so I make my way back to the front gate and wait, nothing till about 5 saying they just left, hour late at this point, so I continue to wait, we live in the same area and it\u2019s only 20 minutes away, 6 pm rolls around and I\u2019m getting irritated, she finally calls me and says that they were there and asked if I could come out and give her her ticket, I told her that she said her mom had bought their tickets so I had just bought mine. She gets irritated and goes and buys her own ticket, I\u2019m inside waiting for her and I see one of her sisters that also works with us, they come over and and immediately start ignoring me, didn\u2019t get introduced to the other two that I\u2019ve never met before second red flag \ud83d\udea9. \n\nAt this point we\u2019re still waiting for the girl I actually tried to go with, she finally gets through the gates (over two hours late) and comes over towards us, walks directly past me without saying anything or even looking at me, third red flag \ud83d\udea9 and I want to go home and we haven\u2019t  even been on any rides yet. While we were in line for the rides, no one spoke to me, I had some exciting news and when I told them they didn\u2019t even care. I felt like a Fifth wheel all night and it was my ideas in the first place. After about 3 rides the 4 girls wanted to get food, so we were walking to the food court and I asked her if she wanted to split from her sisters after we got some food and do our own thing, like she said in her text we would, she said no, her mom told her not to leave her sisters, who were between 17-20 and had their own cellphones. So I told her how I felt, I said I thought this was gonna be more of a date, that\u2019s why I invited you to an amusement park, usually when a guy wants to do something big like that, it\u2019s usually a date, I said it was my idea to come today and I\u2019ve been treated like a 5th wheel all night, she then proceeds to say that it\u2019s just how her family is, her dad said if she left without them to not come back and if she would have known it was a date she would have said no, she\u2019s not interested dating right now because of an ex she had over 2 years ago, like I understand guys suck, but I\u2019ve been through some shit in the last year I\u2019m trying to get past, my ex was pregnant with twins and they were stillborn, I wasn\u2019t interested in dating for a long time but I hate being lonely so this was me trying to get back out there. \n\nEnded up leaving at 8pm because I wasn\u2019t gonna keep getting treated like a 5th wheel. \n\nAITA? \n\nTLDR; asked a coworker on a date to an amusement park, she brought her three sister, I got treated like a 5th wheel and told her how I felt and left early.\n\n\nEdit: formatting",
