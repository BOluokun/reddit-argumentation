  "post content": "So here's the deal. I (19M) smoke weed all day, every day. It's just a normal  part of my routine and I don't see anything wrong with it, and this is not something that I want to be judged on. My mom is completely against me smoking weed, and she's always telling me to stop.  I believe that cannabis is nature's medicine and that society is  oppressive to those who use it. It has helped me in so many ways and it upsets me that it's still stigmatized.\n\nMy mom told me a few days ago that my uncle and younger cousins (4 and 6 years old) would be over around 3PM yesterday, and asked me to not smoke on that day. She always gets upset if she sees me smoking, so I didn't do it while she was home.  She went to the grocery store in the morning and I figured it would be okay to  blaze up in the living room with the windows open before my cousins showed up.\n\nWell as it turns out, my uncle and two cousins showed up early and walked in right as I was in the middle of smoking a joint and lounging on the couch in my underwear. It was a really embarrassing moment, and I'm sure my small cousins were shocked to see me like that. To make matters worse, they saw me coughing in a haze of smoke as they walked in. My uncle was upset and he screamed at me for smoking in front of the children and being \"irresponsible.\" He told me that I needed to grow up and start thinking  about the consequences of my actions. I could tell that he was really disappointed in me, and the whole situation made me really frustrated. \n\nI know this was not a good situation and I regret that my cousins had to see me like that. But here's the thing: I don't think I did anything wrong. My mom told me the wrong arrival time, so how was I supposed to know that my cousins would be coming over early? And I don't see what the big deal is about smoking weed in my own home, as long as I'm not bothering anyone. If I had been told the correct time, this would have been avoided.\n\n**TL;DR:  I smoked weed in my living room while my mom was at the grocery store and my uncle and young cousins showed up early. My mom gave me the wrong arrival time and I don't think I did anything wrong by smoking weed in my own home.**",

                  "content": "See, I do that when I have bud. But I also have severe pain and inflammation problems that weed helps with where other medications have failed. Or if the medications helped they caused horrible side effects like worsening my low blood pressure problems and causing me to faint more often, allergic responses, being so fogged out that I couldn't even understand English or wake up in time for work, severe lung inflammation that landed me in the ER - the list goes on and on. \n\nSmoking before I get up makes it so that getting up doesn't hurt so badly that I procrastinate getting up or have to sit back down every few minutes to work through the pain. It helps to reduce my muscle spasms so that my neck doesn't twitch and then lock up so that I have to go get steroids to unfuck me and let me turn my head again. It significantly reduces my chances of fainting when I stand up and when I shower because it helps to bring up my resting heart rate and blood pressure just enough that I'm mostly normal. When I smoke I get so much more done in a day because of the reduced pain and fainting. The lack of pain actually makes me less foggy than the weed makes me so I'm more mentally clear when I smoke than when I don't. \n\nThe caveat there is that I also don't smoke nearly as much as most people do. What lasts me an entire day is most stoners wake n bake. I smoke a little bit often throughout the day because the physical effects do wear off pretty quickly. I don't like being fogged out all the time though so I keep the hits small and regulate how often I smoke. I've been foggy for most of my life from my pain. I want to actually fucking function for once. And if I don't have the money for it, well that sucks. I don't always have the money for Drs appointments either - I figure it out and pay my damn bills.\n\nThat being said, I dated someone who would go through 6-7x as much as I did in a day and didn't see a problem with the fact that he was too vegged out to function and do basics in life. He would forget appointments constantly and if I didn't remember his schedule for him he'd miss appointments entirely and then blame me for it. He was late for work and often made me late for work because we shared a vehicle. I couldn't even try to save up for my own vehicle because I was dealing with ongoing health issues, covering for him missing bills he was supposed to be responsible for, or paying for maintenance on his vehicle. Plus I was young and got shit pay. \n\nHe wouldn't wash his dishes, or even move the stack from his desk to the sink. He\u2019d have tantrums if I asked him to take care of it because almost every single dish was sitting dirty on his desk, and then tell me I was nagging him. But then he'd bitch that there were no clean dishes to use and throw another tantrum when I refused to clean up after him **again.** He\u2019d go days without showering and not wash his clothes so he'd be wearing the same stank ass shit unless I washed it for him. Eventually I was the only one doing housework despite working as much or more than he did on top of having decreased energy due to my health issues. \n\nHe\u2019d smoke through the majority of the weed and leave none for me unless I hid mine so that I had it available for my pain days and be able to make it to work instead of being dead in bed from my pain. If I refused to give him mine because I actually use it as a medication whereas he smoked recreationally he would blow the months budget and be late on one of the bills he was responsible for. I'd suddenly have no phone service because he skipped a couple months payments on our phone bill to buy himself more weed or fast food despite having food at home. Then he'd blame me and tell me I was abusive for not sharing my weed. \n\nIf he didn't smoke he had what were quite frankly **psychotic** episodes. It's one of the major reasons he's my ex now. He\u2019d swerve at other vehicles on the road with me in the car and drive way beyond what was safe for the level of traffic or weather conditions. And I speed myself but goddamn he was **RECKLESS**. At least I slow down when I see that I'm catching up to traffic ahead and wait for safe space to pass people instead of tailgating and weaving between cars like a nutjob. \n\nHe\u2019d scream about every little thing when they were truly LITTLE issues. He broke electronics because he'd get mad that he lost at something. He screamed at me for hours during a long car trip once because a cop gave him a warning about one of his lights being out. When I ended things he went fully manic and is now still stalking and threatening to kill me. \n\nTL;DR - Saying that people can't be addicted to weed or that it can't be dangerous is fucking **bullshit.** But it's not about how often you smoke as much as it is how *much* you smoke along with your relationship to and dependence on it. It's just like any other substance issue.",
