I think it\u2019s great, follow your goals and live your dream however, this means as I\u2019m working my way up and establishing myself he\u2019s going to be a duckling and starting from the very beginning.\n\nIn the past we\u2019ve discussed kids and I love children but I honestly don\u2019t mind either way if I do or do not have kids (sounds horrible but that\u2019s the only way I can describe it). He on the other hand really wants kids, so we jointly decided that if we have a child he can use the maternity leave to be the stay at home dad. This is mostly because his job is stable, he is very respected and very established in his line of work so taking 6 months to a year out won\u2019t effect him at all and he wants to take that time out for a kid and I do not. If I had to take 6 months out it could ruin my career. \n\nNow he wants to start again with his career, would I be the a-hole If I said \u201cif you choose this route I don\u2019t feel like we can have children\u201d or something along those lines. I don\u2019t like the idea of stepping on someone\u2019s dreams and I personally would hate it if someone told me \u2018no\u2019 but the again I don\u2019t want to be in the position where I have to sacrifice my career because plans have changed. \n\nAm I an a-hole for even considering this and would I be the a-hole for actually saying this?",

If he is starting a completely different career path, he may or may not be allowed to take tons of time off to stay at home with the child.\n\nAlso, no it does not sound horrible that you wouldn't mind having a child or not having one. That's a personal choice and you shouldn't be ridiculed for whatever choice you make. \n\nGood luck! Hopefully an update follows.",

You would be the asshole if you put it in such absolute terms, but absolutely not the asshole for wanting to have a serious discussion about the issue before either of you goes any deeper into the legal profession. This includes the question of who takes leave, when is the right time for children (or is there one?), what kind of jobs will we need to have to get decent benefits for our family, what kind of legal workplaces will be more flexible for young parents and/or family health crises, and so on.  It might even be worth a couple's counseling session or two - preventative counseling BEFORE a major problem arises is not recommended enough.\n\nOne lawyer to another, it's difficult to exaggerate just how demanding a career in law is, whether in a traditional law firm, a nonprofit, or a government office (I've done all three - well, the government was an internship).  I'll never forget a warning I got as a pre-law file clerk from a lawyer with a young family, \"Don't go into litigation if you want to have children.\"  Her oldest was four and her second was two and she was leaving law altogether after five years.\n\n(As an aside, from a lawyer of almost 14 years - has your BF ever worked/volunteered/interned in a legal practice before?  If not, I beseech him to do so - nonprofits are always looking for professional volunteers and even for-profits are happy to get a little free labor in. Let him experience what life in law looks like from day to day BEFORE he commits to the time, expense, and agony of getting a law degree and entering the profession. I say this to EVERYONE considering law school.  Are there any undergraduate prelaw classes he could take taught by actual law professors?  That's a good taster of what law school is like.)",

Trying to restart a new life track into a demanding field AND trying to have kids is another layer of difficulty. There are (depending on your local area) legal employments that are reasonably child-friendly (particularly in state government and some niche areas) but they often don't pay enough to comfortably pay off student loans quickly. Make a plan, expect problems to pop up, but make sure everyone is aware of the cost involved!",

You're unwilling to make compromises in your career? You can be upfront and say that *you* won't sacrifice *your* career, and see where that leaves him. If he decides he's willing to do all the work because he wants the kids *and* the job *and* the killer partner, I don't see anything wrong with that (assuming, of course, one of the things you *are* willing to do is carry the baby).",
