But I am at my mom\u2019s right now due to my father working Tuesdays and Thursdays all day and night, and it\u2019s break for school.\n\n I get incredibly bored at my mom\u2019s. She does hiking and country stuff like camping, and going to swimming holes. That is not my thing, at all I hate doing it because i get bored of it so easily. That\u2019s off topic however.\n\n I recently got a new computer for Christmas, and have been attached to it because I love to play games, That\u2019s just what I do. \n\nEnough Background Info, on to the story.\n\n\n So i\u2019m at my moms, and lo and behold i\u2019m sitting in my phone being bored, because she doesn\u2019t like to do anything i like, she\u2019s sitting watching TV with my sister. I\u2019ve already asked her what are we going to do and if we have plans for the week, as I\u2019m staying there for the middle of the week due to my father working. My dad calls me to check up on me and I say my mind, I\u2019m extremely bored and I wanna go home, to do what I enjoy. He says he can pick me up on. Wedsnday, I say great. So here\u2019s where I might be AITA, idk at this point. I ask my Mom, I\u2019m really bored and I don\u2019t wanna hurt your feelings, but I would rather go to my dads, then stay here. She says no, and that I don\u2019t spend enough time here when I\u2019m here on the weekends (every other) and says I can\u2019t spend any time with her. I get irritated and say well Im not going to spend time with you if your going to select things that are boring. She says: Well you don\u2019t like to do anything except play on you\u2019re fucking computer. \n\nThat isn\u2019t true, I suggest movies or bowling and stuff and she says no.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA\n\n(sorry for bad formatting, i\u2019m on phone)",

Your mum seems very unwilling to compromise, as it sounds like you accompany her on activities she likes often but she doesn\u2019t really try to do the things you like to do with you. I know it\u2019s hard but maybe just seem a little more interested when you do her activities with her, so maybe she\u2019ll have a \u201cShe/he\u2019s making an big effort, I have to make one too...\u201d moment, I\u2019m not 100% on that though.",

You can do your honest best to have a relationship with both and naturally be closer to one than the other. I\u2019d recommend you don\u2019t tell your mom she\u2019s boring you though.  It\u2019s not her job to entertain you. Instead of \u201cyou\u2019re boring,\u201d maybe try, \u201chey, I\u2019d like to spend time with you doing something we both enjoy. Could you help me come up with some ideas?\u201d",
