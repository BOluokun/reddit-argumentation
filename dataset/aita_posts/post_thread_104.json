  "post content": "My wife OCD. She\u2019s on medication, but there are still things that she is extremely particular about, one part of this is where she puts things. She has certain things in specific places, she has the silver ware in a certain drawer, the coffee table pressed to the side of the wall, the coffee maker below the coffee cups she also works from home and is often in meetings. \n\nThis is how she operates and generally get through the day, there\u2019s a specific Place for everything and for a reason and it\u2019s convenient. Frankly I thinks these spots are where most people keep there things. \n\nWhen she\u2019s in meeting or talking to people she\u2019ll keep her ear piece in go make coffee as they are talking and so forth, so she\u2019s usually rushing. Honestly I don\u2019t even know if this is even apart of OCD or just a matter of her every day routine that throws her off when it\u2019s not there. \n\nMom was coming down to NJ where I live visiting me and my siblings. She was staying with us, and usually this isn\u2019t an issue, but mom continues to move things around the house. Like the things I\u2019ve mentioned. She moved the coffee maker and the cups apart so they are hanging where there are hooks on the wall.(the opposite way of the coffee maker) she moved the coffee table to the center of the room, she re arranged all of the plates, cups. She\u2019s putting my wife\u2019s pens,paper,notebooks,laptop(all in *her* office)in different places so my wife  has to rummage around to find them.Mom keeps closing the blinds making it dark and gloomy in the house. This gets my wife overwhelmed and has a bigger impact than how simple it seems and her side tracked from work because now she has to find everything and put it back.  \n\nThis has been happening for the past three days, each time mom does it I tell her to put it back then she gets mad at me saying this is where everything should be and she\u2019s just helping us. I stayed firm and told her to put it back. Which she does, but once I leave, it\u2019s back to where I told her not to put it. \n\nIt\u2019s starting to irritate me and my wife is getting really frustrated with this. I don\u2019t think she or I can handle this for 2 weeks. Today, mom moved my wife\u2019s office desk to the other side of the room (away from all the cabinets she has stored for her work things) \n\nThis was it, I profusely told her to move it back *and* why. I told her that she\u2019s going to have to stay with my sister or find a hotel. \n\nShe got really mad at me and my wife and told me she can\u2019t believe we are so selfish to not appreciate her help then said if she\u2019s not appreciated she\u2019ll leave. \n\nShe left, but now I\u2019m getting blasted from my sister and my brother saying I was an asshole for kicking her out and this is just how she shows affection. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole, we opened our hole to her which is already kinda a lot, it\u2019s our home, we should feel comfortable in our home, and our set up was comfortable for both of us.",

In addition, she had gone shopping and bought a crap ton of decorations that she hung on the walls, a new rug she put on the floor in our living room, and new curtains for the living room. She had also bought new bedding for the kids' rooms and our rooms but hadn't had a chance to get them on before we got home.\n\nI was BEYOND infuriated. She treated MY house as if it was HER house and I was incensed. However, she turned on the waterworks and cried that she just wanted to help us get settled in and she couldn't believe how unappreciative I was being! To make matters worse, my ex-husband (notice the EX there) backed her up and, even after they left he wouldn't let me take anything down or get rid of it.\n\nJoke was on him though. He left for a 6 month TDY and the FIRST thing I did the day after he left was move my furniture back where WE had agreed it should be, and got rid of every single thing she had brought into my home. Then I went shopping. When ex got home and saw the house he flipped out but, I told him that if he wanted to live in a house his mother had decorated, he could go live with her in HER house. This was the worst of her transgressions but, it wasn't her last and my momma's boy husband took her side every time. I finally had enough and we divorced.\n\nNTA OP and good for you for standing up for your wife. I guarantee that your mom knew EXACTLY what she was doing and did it on purpose to mess with your wife.
