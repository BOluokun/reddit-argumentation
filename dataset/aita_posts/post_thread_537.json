  "post content": "  I (26f) recently got a new flatmate (25m), renting one of the rooms in an apartment in my name. The two other people living here are away for weeks at the time, so it's mostly me and him (especially in the past 5 weeks). He's friendly and social and everything has been great for the first 3 months, we hung out and I felt comfortable hanging around the flat looking like sh\\*t, which is very important to me, as I am one of those people who recharge batteries away from social situations.\n\nHe recently got a girlfriend, who seems nice and rents a room in an flat nearby. Even though we had all agreed to try and give one other fair warning when bringing someone home, he lets me know she's coming over approximately 30 seconds before she arrives. As I feel uncomfortable being the extra-person in the room during date nights and snuggle time, I tend to either go out or lock myself in my room when he brings her home (she always comes over mid-week and after 9pm and I don\u2019t love going out in the snow just to give them space). Kitchen and living room are the same room, so I only use the bathroom and smoke out of my bedroom window.\n\nLast week I was on my way home from work, looking forward to taking off my bra and relaxing on the couch in front of the TV. As I walked in he told me she was on her way over and they were going to cook and have a romantic dinner. She had already been over 3 three times during the same week, talking loudly right outside my door late at night knowing I had an early shift. So I snapped and told him \"It's okay for tonight, but this cannot be an everyday thing, next time please go to her place\". I apologized for the tone a couple minutes later, but I stood by my statement. He wants me to be comfortable having her around the apartment, and it's nice of him, but he also said he'd like her to stay over every night and his bed is more comfortable than hers so he'd rather have her sleep here.\n\nI don't want to be the a\\*\\*hole who tells him she cannot come over, and I am aware that there is no real issue with me looking like shit or sitting in the common areas while she's there, but I simply don't feel comfortable. I didn't rent the room to a couple because I've lived with couples before and it was a nightmare (it's not nice having to third wheel every time you want to watch a movie on the couch in your own home). Obviously, he should be able to have his girlfriend over, but it's starting to be too often and he's taking over the entire apartment, since at this point, I'm either out or in my room. This is the first time he lives in a shared flat, he's always had his own place and that results in him not really thinking about anyone else other than himself when it comes to shared spaces. Talking to him hasn\u2019t given any results.\n\nI need to know: AITA for not wanting her to come over every day or is it reasonable to say no to something that makes me feel uncomfortable in my own home?",

The fact that you live in a shared space now goes both ways\u2014he should be considerate, and you can\u2019t expect him to not use shared space\n\nAs long as it\u2019s not to the point where she\u2019s basically moved in (which she hasn\u2019t) and isn\u2019t doing anything particularly disruptive (she\u2019s not), it\u2019s not really fair to limit his use of the space\n\nBut, he should communicate better anyway since it\u2019s not just his space, either\n\nI think you\u2019d be better off communicating with him about what you would like\u2014for example, that you like to unwind for a bit at X time\n\nOverall it sounds like a roommate compatibility issue more than an asshole situation",

Besides the one time they were talking loudly, the only other problem was that it made her uncomfortable which to me, is your own problem to fix, not someone else's. You can't ask a grown adult in their mid-twenties to not do normal adult things. So as long as her problem stems from her being uncomfortable and not the loud talking being an every night occurrence, I'm leaning more towards NAH.",
