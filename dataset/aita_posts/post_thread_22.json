  "post content": "I have a 16 year old daughter, and she has 3 big chores that we pay her allowance for. She puts out the garbage, cleans up the dog poop in the backyard, and empties the dishwasher. I refill the dishwasher, so when she doesn't do her job I can't do mine (yes, I could just do it myself, and I have, but we pay her to do it, so why should I?) \n\nThis weekend my wife asked her to empty the dishwasher, and take the trash out. She said \"Ok\" then just went up to her room. I went up to her room an hour later, and found her laying in bed watching youtube on her phone (Volleyball videos, nothing important, if anything on youtube could be considered important) I took her phone away, and said \"Your mom asked you to do your chores, not watch videos, please do them so i can do mine\" She said \"Whatever\" and just continued laying there. So I told her if she is not down in 10 minutes I was going to send a picture of myself to all of her friends on snapchat. Now we have tried plenty of different methods of punishment, but nothing really gets to her. I know how important social media is to the kids now a days, so i figured I would try that, and see if anything happened.\n\nI gave her 20 minutes, and still nothing. So true to my word my wife and I took a selfie on her phone and I sent it to all of her friends with the caption \"Someone didn't do her chores like we asked :'( \" I didn't go through her messages, i didn't even read the replies to our picture, that was it. A few of her friends know me, and know what I'm like, but apparently the picture went to a group chat from her school, and to a few boys she liked and just stalked on social media, but didn't message. She says it was so embarrassing, and I'm an a-hole for doing that.\n\nBut come last night, my wife asked her to do the dishes. She first refused and went up to her room, but I reminded her what would happen if she didn't listen. She was downstairs like a rocket and put the dishes away so fast she almost broke some of them. So obviously the punishment seemed to have worked (for now), but she screamed at me calling me an a-hole all night. I am just a Stepdad, so I'm still fairly new at this. So I thought I would bring the vote to you guys. AITA here?",

Kids that are struggling in school or upset about something they can't handle on thier own need to know their parents are safe and on their side. Public shaming makes it very, very clear that parents can't be trusted in that situation.

You can tell her your idea and let her be the one to deliver the message. I don't mean forever, just until y'all gel more as a family.\n\n2) Both of you need to make your expectations clear the *first* time you ask for something. My own dad used to drive me crazy with this. He'd ask for something non-urgent to be done, and I'd agree, knowing I'd do it in X hours or whatever. Then he'd get mad that it hadn't been done right when he'd asked, even though it wasn't clear that was important. He wasn't consistent, either, so it was deeply aggravating. Giving her a reason it needs to be done within that timeframe will also help.\n\nTl;dr version: next time it's time for her to do a chore, the reminder/request should be: \"I'm filling the dishwasher in ten minutes, so I need you to empty it now.\" Or whatever.\n\nEdit: I forgot about the allowance part! I don't hate the social media thing, but if her allowance is contingent on her doing the chores, you already have consequences in place and the Snapchat thing made you a little bit TA.  If withholding the money isn't enough to get her to do her chores, though, cancel the allowance and continue to embarrass her until she shapes the fuck up.",

I can't unload the dishwasher until you load it, and you might want to wait to load the dishwasher until I finish cooking dinner. I might need you to start loading the dishwasher so I can wash the vegetables and clean as I cook. A 16 year old should be able to identify these dependencies and plan accordingly. \n\nBut I don't think it's asking too much to explain a non-apparent reason for wanting a chore done immediately instead of later. A lot of the time a parent will want something done *now* so they don't have to think about it and check up on it later. And that's perfectly fair, but I still think that should be communicated to the kid. If it is, that helps the kid get a better understanding of the mental load of managing a household. Then \"because having to keep track of everything and remembering to do it later is a lot of effort\" is a compelling answer. \n\nOther times, there's a more specific (and to a teenager, more compelling) reason. A parent might want their kid to wash his soccer uniform now instead of tomorrow or later this evening because they're planning to launder all the bedding and that will take 5 or 6 loads of laundry, which would not be readily apparent to the kid. Telling him why is a lot easier than fighting him on \"because I said so\", and it would teach the kid how to prioritize and order tasks in a logical fashion. \n\nThere's room for lots of different approaches, but I'm always in favor of explaining reasoning and clearly setting out expectations, especially if the kid is asking why and is old enough to understand the answer.",

What I always hated as a teenager was the fact that a chore would randomly appear out of nowhere when I had other things planned, or had set aside some time to do fuck all because I was tired.\n\nSo when a parent gives a chore and a deadline (\"I need you to empty the dishwasher now, because I need to fill it, so I can relax later, because I am tired after work\") they generally never take into account what the teenager has planned. Maybe they had a shitty day at school and just need an hour to decompress before they get to it. Maybe they planned \"ok, I can clean my room tomorrow, because I really want to watch the latest Rick and Morty so I can talk about it tomorrow with my friends\". Etc. Etc. \n\nI mean, I'm an adult, and sometimes I put off things to the next day because I'm just too tired or unmotivated to do it today. Kids want to do that too. \n\nThis of course doesn't mean that you should never have a teenager do a chore immediately. It just means that both parent and kid need to talk to each other and have clear expectations. Sometimes the kid has to face it and just do the chore, and sometimes the parent has to accept that maybe they can do it later because it really doesn't need to be done on the parents schedule.",

Maybe just \"it's part of life.\")\n\nKids are best prepared for life if they get in the habit of doing a wide variety of chores consistently from a young age.

I don\u2019t remember what. I do remember he responded by dancing around and embarrassing me more. As an adult, I totally get why that was funny and lighthearted to him.

I keep in touch with my parents, and I love them.

Sure, if she has a good social group like I did in high school, this would be laughed off in a week or two.

Although even typing that out I know that if he sent something like that to certain people I had to associate with (on sports teams and in NHS) I would possibly stop attending because I would never hear the end of it... and not in a fun way. High school social dynamics are hard and if he sent that to everyone she knows that could be really hard for her to deal with and kids can get out of control quickly.
