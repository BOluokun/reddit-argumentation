  "post content": "I adopted my cat when she was four from the shelter. It had taken a while to talk my husband into letting us get a cat but, with the agreement that she's my responsibility, he finally relented. I remember how scared she was there and, as one of the declawed cats, she had to spend most of her time in a small cage for her safety. We bonded immediately and she's always at my side ever since.\n\nI don't know if I was so excited that I missed them saying anything or the shelter never mentioned it, but I had no idea she had any issues. She began to have asthma attacks, licking herself raw and peeing outside of her box. She's on expensive medicine now that controls the wheezing and licking, but I've never been able to resolve the peeing. Multiple boxes, buying special litter, etc. It could help to get litter boxes on multiple floors, but my husband won't allow that for the smell.\n\nFor years, I had been trying to deal with the stressful situation. My husband has never been happy with the result (heightened sense of smell) and makes passive aggressive remarks about it. I can't smell it. He also said her fur bothered him at night so she was kicked out of our bedroom and then he's upset that she'd cry at the door. I always feel like I'm blamed for the problems.\n\nRecently to help make things tolerable, we tried an extreme solution. Our cat now spends the day while we're gone and all night in the basement to control the peeing and odor. When she's out of the basement, she's always with one of us, so we have to close her in rooms we're in. She's not happy with this and wants free reign of the house.  He's not happy because, even though she's not able to pee in the living spaces, she meows and constantly tries to escape rooms we're in and he doesn't like the heat (house cooler with doors open) and smell being trapped in the room we're in. And he says he can still smell her anyways \"wafting up through vents in the basement\".\n\nRecently, I was informed that she has gingivitis, which will be another costly medical issue on top of her already expensive medicines. Right now, it's a stretch to afford the care. We were in a better financial situation when we got the cat.\n\nWe've had her four years now and empathize with my husband that it sucks to have these issues in your home where you can't escape them. I know he didn't want a cat in the first place and only relented because I wanted one really bad. But last night, I got the \"me or the cat\" ultimatum.\n\nAt her age (atleast 8) and with these medical issues and her attachment to me, I can't imagine it will be easy to find a good home for her. I can take her back to the non kill shelter I got her from but she was miserable there too and I just cry thinking of her sitting in one of those cages again or just being anxious wondering where I am. But I also love my husband and empathize with his unhappiness as well. I just don't know what to do there's no happy ending.",

Since she is declawed she'll need the absolute softest and finest sand you can find, and there should be litter boxes in all the areas she tends to pee. She needs trees and shelves so she can move around rooms without touching the floor. She needs to be played with daily, all her energy needs to be drained otherwise she will bother you during the night. You absolutely cannot confine her to the basement that is abuse and thats why you suck because you allow this. I also read in the comments that you dont have a tree? Why not? Give the show My cat from hell a watch if you want to make things work otherwise yes she needs another home.",
