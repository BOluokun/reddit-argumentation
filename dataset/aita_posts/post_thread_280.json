  "post content": "\nI f26 was invited to my sister's (18th) birthday few days ago at a restaurant. My husband didn't come because he said he had a meeting dinner with some clients. This made my family feel let down especially my sister who wanted him there and also her 18th birthday was a big deal to her obviously.\n\n\n\nTo my surprise, When I arrived I noticed that my husband was having his meeting at the same place, his table was right in the corner and he had about 4 men sitting with him. My parents and the guests saw him as well. I waved for him and he saw me but ignored me. He obviously was as much as surprised as I was.\n\n\n\nMy parents asked why he didn't even come to the table to acknowledge them after the cake arrived. I got up and walked up to his table. I stood there and said excuse me, my husband was silent when I asked (after I introduced myself to the clients) if he'd take few minutes to join me and the family in candle blowing and say happy birthday but he barely let out a phrase and said \"I don't think so, I'm busy right now\". I insisted saying it'd just take a couple of minutes and that it'd mean so much to my sister. He stared at me then stared awkwardly back at his clients. They said nothing and he got up after my parents were motionning for me to hurry up.\n\n\nHe sat with us while my sister blew the candles and cut the cake. My parents insisted he takes a piece and join us in the selfie but he got up and walked back to his table looking pissed. We haven't talked til we met later at home.\n\n\nHe was upset and starred scolding me infront of my parents saying I embarrassed him and made him look unprofessional and ruined his business meeting. I told him he overreacted since it only took few minutes and it was my sister's birthday and my family wanted him to join since he was literally in the same restaurant. He called me ignorant and accused me of tampering with his work but I responded that ignoring mine and my family's presence was unacceptable.\n\n\nWe argued then he started stone walling me and refusing to talk to me at all.\n\n\nFYI) I didn't have an issue with him missing the event, but after seeing that he was already there then it become a different story.\n\nAlso it literally took 5-7 minutes. He didn't even eat nor drink. Just sat down and watched.",

If you wanted him there then you should have moved the date of the celebration. \n\n>My parents asked why he didn't even come to the table to acknowledge them after the cake arrived. \n\nBecause he was working. \n\n>I asked (after I introduced myself to the clients) if he'd take few minutes to join me and the family in candle blowing but he barely let out a phrase and said \"I don't think so, I'm busy right now\".

You should have left it alone.  You embarrassed him in a professional setting.  Also,  he is allowed to have boundaries. No is a complete sentence. \n\n>My parents insisted he takes a piece and join us in the selifie but he got up and walked back to his table looking pissed.\n\nBecause he didn't want to be there.  He had a prior commitment. He TOLD you he didn't want to be there.  \n\n>He was upset and starred scolding me infront of my parents saying I embarrassed him and made him look unprofessional and ruined his business meeting.\n\nYou absolutely did.\n\n>He called me ignorant and accused me of tampering with his work but I responded that ignoring mine and my family's presence was unacceptable.\n\nYou are and you did.  You and your family's response and lack of support is what is unacceptable. You and your parents are adults, it is your jobs to manage your feelings.  Your sister is 18 not 6. She should understand although you typed all this out and still has to ask if you are the asshole so....",

If you get it right it can set you up for a great career.\n\nOne night my parent's next door neighbours come in for dinner, and have a great experience. They then get up from their table and without any hesitation just waltz into the kitchen to come and say 'hi'. The dining room's packed, I've got 5 different tickets on the go, the sous chef barking instructions at me, and they expected me to stop everything to chat.\n\nThankfully the executive chef/owner/media darling came over and introduced himself, explained that we were in the middle of service and that their presence was a health code violation and thus had to return to the dining room, and then offered to comp their desserts.\n\nThe next morning I get a call from my mum asking why I'd been so rude to Mr. and Mrs. Next Door, and 'what was so important that you couldn't be pleasant for 5 minutes?'
