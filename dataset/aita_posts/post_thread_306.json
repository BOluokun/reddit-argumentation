I'll just mention the relevent conflict at hand.\n\n\nSo My wife Liz and I have been married for 7 years. we have preschool age kids, and because we currently live in the same city as my parents. Mom would take the kids while my wife and I work.\n\n\nLiz is the one with a much larger income, she got an even better job opportunity that is requiring us to move to another city. I agreed since I could easily find a job in my field in the city we're moving to. but after my family heard we were selling the house to move, hell broke loose.\n\nSunday, mom and Liz got into a huge fight because Liz told mom we'll move away and hire a babysitter for the kids so she's no longer \"needed\". mom said she doesn't want her grandkids moving away, even said we should let the kids live at her house while we move. Liz laughed at her and mom lost it basically saying that Liz was an ungrateful witch and that her grandkids moving will only happen over her dead body. they began exchanging harsher words and Liz snapped and told mom to butt out of private matters that don't concern her. and said that she had no right to decide things regarding the kids. Mom firmly told her she was dead wrong and proceeded to tell her that she, as an involved grandmother, knows her rights and she will be taking Liz and me to court to ensure she still gets to see her grankids. Liz was in shock, she looked to the left and saw me sitting there not saying or doing anything. She told me to check my mom but I told her she was being unfair to mom and that mom had to feel upset because she will no longer be able to see her grandchildren - I honestly told Liz that she was a bit selfish to not consider my mom's feelings and her crucial presence in the kids life first. Liz started arguing with me saying she couldn't believe I didn't stand behind her and defend her after hearing mom saying she'd get the court involved. I said mom was upset and can not be blamed for her reaction. Liz started yelling at me calling me unsupportive and an enabler then went home with the kids, insisting my family is MY problem and I should handle it although this whole moving thing was her idea.\n\nSituation hasn't been resolved and Liz and mom are getting more intense in their fights. I choose to stay out of it because both have valid arguments but Liz has called me awful for not siding with her after seeing how mom spoke to her and being okay with the fact that mom was willing to cause us issues in court.\n\n\nAITA? I get that Liz wants my support but I feel like mom has been punished through no fault of her own after being a loving grandmother to my kids.",

Between foster care work and adolescent/teen counseling work, I know warning signs when I see them. Your mother has every right to be upset *but she is threatening to remove your own children from your custody* and no matter how bonkers that will seem to a family court judge, the whole process would be traumatic for your children. Every moment she continues to see them unsupervised she has the ability to poison them against you and since you\u2019re moving regardless, she will really damage your kids and cause unnecessary strife and trauma. And if you think it\u2019s not possible for a loving person to coerce children to lie about abuse, the Satanic Ritual Abuse Panic of the 1980s and 1990s would like to speak to you.
