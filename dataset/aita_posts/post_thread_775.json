  "post content": "My roommate has helped me a lot in the past. Im hard off, and jobless. He invited me to come stay at his house for however long I need. He's bought food and little things I needed also gave me his old phone when it cracked. I found out I was pregnant recently and applied for food stamps, I get $192 a month. I'm trying not to eat crap food (he only buys pizza and fast food) and buy things when I need them. It's the 16th and I've already gone through it. I'm not sure if this is because I suck at budgeting or maybe too generous. Probably a bit of both. I don't mind sharing, I just can't as much anymore to make things last. We live with three other people. Two out of these three have stolen from me multiple times money/food. I'm suspicious a lot. It kinda makes me seem like a real asshole sometimes.\n\nLast night I kinda freaked out on him. \n\nI made dinner before he got home and put the left overs in the fridge. He came in with an iced coffee and asked to use my honey. (Gross but ok) just please don't use a lot, it's exspensive. (He knows this because it's the 3rd bottle Ive bought because he uses so much) So later I walk into the kitchen and he's got my left over eggs in a bowl, a brand new thing of bread opened when there was one already opened next to it (arrg!) \"Please don't eat my eggs I was saving them for tomorrow. Also did you not see the already open bread?\" He starts apologizing saying he didnt see the open bread (eyeroll) says he'll put the eggs back. He starts apologizing again, I tell him it's okay I overreacted but I'd really appreciate if he'd ask me before taking things.. he says something along the lines of, \"he didn't think he was like the other roommates and thought him and I were on a no questions about food basis.\" I said, \"Well yes, you're not like the other roommates, but I've told you multiple times I have to make this food last as long as possible and I really don't like people taking things without asking.\"\nNext morning. I wake up to eat my left over bacon and eggs from dinner. Open fridge, eggs are in the same bowl he dumped them into the night prior, no cover over them just in the middle of the fridge. I had them in a ziplock in my drawer, so that's a bit aggravating. Nevermind it, continue looking for my bacon, there were 6 pieces left. Gone. I'm pretty mad at this point. I ask him about it he says he didn't eat them. Okay.. but we've been the only ones home? \n\nI'm trying hard to just let these things go. But bacon is one of the more exspensive things I bought and I didn't even eat the majority of it. Ive pretty much keep having to beg him to just ASK me before taking things. \n\nAm I wrong for being upset? Should I just let it be since he's done so much for me? I feel like an asshole being so bent over food.",
