When I applied to live here I wasn\u2019t told that there would be frequent construction going on in the complex as well as our apartment. The apartment is in really good shape and i don\u2019t really have any issues with it. Currently the only thing needing to be fixed is a huge square hole they cut in our ceiling.

I was frustrated with the first one but figured I couldn\u2019t do much about it. At the end of that month we received another of these letters. I feel like giving staff the ability to enter an apartment at anytime is intrusive. I\u2019m constantly on edge about being able to shower during the day because what if I step into my room to find a staff member? I can\u2019t even take a short nap between school work because half the time I\u2019m woken up by someone needing to work on the apartment. \n       I feel like I live in a constant state of being prepared for someone to enter my room. I can\u2019t relax until after 5 pm. My roommates and I keep a tidy apartment so we don\u2019t have an issue with receiving a citation for cleanliness. I have an anxiety disorder and i feel like this constant stress is making it harder on me to be a functioning person. I feel like I don\u2019t have my own space because of this. I also feel like a have almost no privacy.\n       I just need to know if I\u2019m being an asshole about this.  I would like to complain to my university housing department but maybe I\u2019m just being way too sensitive. I understand that sometimes things need to be fixed but currently our apartment is fine and livable. Summer is approaching and we are being kicked out for further improvements to the apartment. I don\u2019t understand why these issues they see can\u2019t wait until then. \n\n\n\n\nUpdate: After reviewing the housing policy it seems they are able to enter whenever they see fit for maintenance. Thank you to everyone for the advice. I will be discussing it with housing and possibly taking it further if needed. ",
