  "post content": "We had to temporarily move in with MIL and it sucks because she thinks she gets a vote on everything. She critiques my parenting, my marriage, how I dress. She doesn't even like the food I cook for my husband. It's really hard on our marriage and makes me want to get the fuck out of here.\n\nRecently my husband and I had a pretty big fight. I'm aware it is immature that we fought loud enough MIL could hear, but I was just heated because he played a \"prank\" and squirted me with the hose through a window while I was using the toilet, and I felt so degraded and disrespected.\n\nMIL decided to butt in and tell us how much our marriage sucks. she said I'm so miserable and uptight that if she was married to me she would cheat, and she feels bad for her son for having to be with someone so miserable. She said I should work on myself because no man is going to put up with that.\n\nI asked if she would like to be married to her son and she just rolled her eyes. Now I might be the asshole here, but I said I actually don't think she would. If they were two random people who met on the street, she would 100% say he isn't good enough for her. I've seen the men she is with. Her standards are sky high, so she should shut the fuck up. I could see my husband was mortified. I know he already has some insecurities. \n\nI then said I didn't even want her advice because she cheated on her first husband. MIL told me to fuck off and said I have no idea what happened in her first marriage. I might also be the asshole because MIL's stepkids heard this and now they have more shit to talk about her. After they left MIL called me a misogynist and asked if I seriously thought her first husband never cheated on her, and said I need to mind my own business. Her husband also yelled at me about how I shouldn't be saying anything when I live in their house.",

And while she is certainly in her right to be angry about his prank, it is not a prank I would call malicious or use to define him as a bad person or husband. Also getting out stuff about the MIL like her cheating is asshole behaviour. \n\nI know many people here are young, but eye for an eye is biblical and not morally right in most people's minds. You address MIL behaviour, and don't stomp down to her level, because OP started talking shit about MIL and her own husband in relationships as a counter to MIL talking shit about her in relationships.

Then you have to account for security deposits which can be 1-2 months rent. And then you can still get denied for the apartment after paying that, so you'd have to be able to apply for multiple apartments.

She asked for it. It's not like she's going to treat you better if you shut up, she'd gladly treat you as a free target practice. So I say give as good as you get:) \n\nAlso, your husband shouldn't allow his mom to treat you this way... You shouldn't have to go against her. She's not your mom, she's his responsibility and *he* should rein her in when she crosses big boundaries.\n\nI don't know why you live there but I hope it isn't for long.
