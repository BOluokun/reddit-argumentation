  "post content": "I (50F) have asked my family (47M, 15M, 14F) to either state beforehand if they are going to make a stinky fart or go to the bathroom to fart and then light a match after. Today at the breakfast table my husband did the thing where he leans to one side to lift a buttcheek (I assume? Actually not sure what the purpose of the leaning is) to fart loudly. Hilarious, sort of, but also gross. He does this infrequently.\n\nThis began a discussion where everyone told me that my fart rules are body shaming and not cool. They were tongue-in-cheek but also serious about the body shaming. I told them no one wants to smell surprise stinkiness (hence the announcing) which wouldn't be necessary if people would just go to the bathroom to fart (ideal). According to them, not farting loudly or stinkily in front of others is a just me thing or maybe just a UK thing (I grew up in the UK). No one has suggested that it's an on-the-spectrum thing because my family doesn't hold that over my head, but I wonder. And I honestly find it gauche to like, have a farting stance, but again, they say that's just me. Really? We live in Mexico and I haven't noticed any public farting.\n\nMy family says within the family it's fine to just fart away. Some context: I got massively told off by my in-laws in the pandemic year where we were always together for dinner for suggesting people refrain from talking with food in their mouths at the table in front of my kids, because we were trying to teach them this rule. That was true, but also I really find it disgusting when people do that. Normally we live in a different country so I suck it up when we're all together. But this was every night, so that day it became a huge fight between me and my husband where I slept on the couch for days and refused to eat at the table if we couldn't agree on what I thought was basic manners specially as an example for my kids but honestly because I hate it. My mother-in-law has ADHD and she says if she stops talking to chew she'll forget what she has to say and then she won't be able to tell us. Plus, it was her table, her house. I realise I was horrible and the lesson I learned there is to not care so hard about manners over people's feelings. (In case anyone wonders, my couch-sleeping has only happened once or twice in my marriage, it's not common).\n\nSo here we are, my family has told me they would like to fart freely in the house and my rules are nonsense. I hesitate to disagree because of the talking-with-our-mouths-full episode. I want to be lighthearted and laugh it off. But, stinky! Stinky farts! You can taste them! I think it's pretty reasonable to ask to not live in a fart zone. We (or maybe just me I guess) do have other rules like, knock before entering someone's room, say please and thank you, etc. I'm not going to list them all because of space. So reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: I tell my family they should either say they're going to fart or go to a different room to fart. They say this rule is unreasonable. AITA?\n\nEDIT: the farting isn't constant, it's infrequent. Not daily. And it's 90% accidental which we laugh off.\n\n2nd EDIT: The rule is several years old. Possibly decades old for my husband. When I said 'I have asked' I meant, in the past, not recently.",

I mean I definitely had a blast when my 3 year old niece discovered Alexa will make fart noises and gives descriptive details about their sound....but constant stinky and loud farts at the table? That's beyond childish and immature. The same Alexa fart loving niece even at most would blow up and then push her cheeks to make a noise like a fart during a mealtime but even that would be pushing it for her. \n\nI know you said your family doesn't try and hold your diagnosis over your head but this sounds like they're deliberately trying to make you feel bad and uncomfortable which is pretty awful to do :( . Expecting someone to always leave or announce a fart is not an appropriate thing to ask in normal circumstances because people normally aren't weaponizing farts to constantly cause another family member distress like they are here. They aren't going to do it because they're purposely doing it to upset you. \n\nThe chewing thing- it's totally gross to chew with your mouth open. No matter where you are and making conscious efforts to model appropriate normal behavior and manners for your kids is totally fine. I'm an adhd talker that forgets what I'm gonna say too all the time and have found myself speaking before swallowing and you know what? I'm always mortified by it! But it's not something that's a constant habit or anything and her reason for why it's ok is just bad. She should just not say the thing or wait to take a bite. It does sound like you got a bit rigid but not spraying others with food and open mouth chewing is not a big or absurd ask. It's the bare minimum. Backpackers have more table manners than that. \n\nThe fact that your husbands family basically made you feel like you were the problem and acting awful is nonsense. , they're not nice or good people. They're not treating you with decency or respect. You deserve better",
