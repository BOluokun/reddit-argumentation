  "post content": "Hey I'm 29 my husband is 34. We have an 5 month old daughter. I have decided I want to become a veggie mainly for enviromental reasons. I've been considering doing this for some time as I think meat production has a hugely negative effect. Having our daughter has made me a bit more eco conscious as I am afraid of the world she'll live in in the future. I've been trying to reduce the meat in my diet for some time. My husband doesn't want to do this and complains every time I cook a meatless meal. I am a SAHM at and cook almost all of our meals. I've told him I don't want to cook meat anymore and that if he wants to eat meat then he can cook it himself and that he is lucky I am cooking for him everyday whatever I cook. However he says that I should also at least cook meat and add this to the meal for him. He says I can't force him to change his diet and eat less meat but I say that I'm not as he can still cook him meat. He says it is unfair on him to force this major lifestyle change on him. And he thinks I am being hypocritical and petty not cooking meat anymore when I've eaten it all my life. He thinks it is silly me not cooking meat for him if he is going to do it later, as I am just saving him from cooking meat and the amount of meat cooked will be the same so he thinks the only result in this is me not doing something nice for him. But I think doing that would be a massive inconvenience for me and also it defeats the purpose of me becoming veggie in the first place. I do kinda understand his point of view. He also is unhappy that I plan to cook veggie meals for our daughter and thinks it is unfair to force her into being a vegetarian but again i don't think I am as I don't plan on stopping her eating meat in school etc. Just wondering what y'all think about this?",

You\u2019re either passing off a duty that you used to do (cooking his meals) onto him, without any discussion, or making him become vegetarian with you.\n\nAnd your daughter has two parents - *both* of you should have a say in the diet and mentality she is raised on.",
