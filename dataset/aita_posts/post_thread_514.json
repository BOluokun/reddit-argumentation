  "post content": "When Smoke came to us, he was skinny and had mats. He had been shot with a bb gun in the leg and had a raging bladder infection. We took him to the vet for wound care and antibiotics. Put him on a prescription diet. Nursed him back to health for a month, and all the while, I was putting up posts on NextDoor and Facebook, and anywhere else I could think of to help find his people. He wasn't microchipped. Nobody came forward. So, after 45 days, we took him to get microchipped and claimed him as our own. We have loved this boy for a year now. He's family. He's especially bonded with my son, who has autism and hangs out with him when the anxiety gets bad. \n\nLast night, a woman and a little girl came to our door to ask if we took in a grey cat because they saw him in the window. They said he got out when they moved here to AZ from Texas a year ago and have been looking for him everywhere. I brought him out so they could see him and immediately, they said he was theirs. But- they said he was 8 years old. My vet aged him at 2. They said he had missing teeth. He does not. They showed me a picture of their cat and it kinda looks like him, but the face is slightly different. They called him Demon, but he doesn't even respond to that. I have my doubts that he's even their cat, but I don't know if I'm deluding myself because I don't want to give him up. They said they don't want to take him away if we love him. We do, very much. But I also don't want to be the a-hole that takes a little girl's cat away either. \n\nHelp me, friends. What is the right course of action here?",

If it was just the age difference, I might say the vet was just off by a few years, but your cat didn't grow new teeth. It's not their cat, they just want to believe it is because the alternative, that their cat is probably gone forever and may even be dead, is too heartbreaking to consider. If it makes them feel better to believe it's their cat, but they're willing to let you keep him, just let them believe that. You'd only have to convince them it's not their cat if they demanded him back.",
