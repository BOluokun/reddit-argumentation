  "post content": "Ok hear me out,\n\nIm 15 now, and the day still keeps me up at night and occasionally gives me claustrophobia to this day, 10 years ago in my old apartment when i was 5, my sister was about 2 or 3, she needed to go but she wasn\u2019t tall enough to reach the door handle, so i had to open it for her. I closed the door for privacy when she went in, instantly forgetting that she was way too short to reach the door handle (my brain was the size of a walnut), and i went to go read a book on the one-person couch. I was estranged by the fact that she was taking particularly long in the bathroom, i heard the flushing and everything, as it our toilet was VERY loud. I continued on my book, but then got increasingly confused, as she never came out, i\u2019d assume at the time that she was going No. 2, but even then i estimated that 10 minutes had gone by (when i got older and reflected on the incident i estimated the time, because the concept of time was so foreign to me it was like another language). Then, when i thought she couldn\u2019t take any longer, i heard crying, i headed towards the bathroom because i suddenly remembered again that she was short, but then i stopped mid-run because i knew that it would be inappropriate for me to open the door for her. I got mom, and she turned the handle, when it didn\u2019t budge, she yelled to me from the living room and asked why it wouldn\u2019t work, i didn\u2019t know, but to this day, i suspect i might\u2019ve used the washroom a while before she did, and since i always locked my bathroom door, i might\u2019ve coincidentally not pushed the door all the way in, so that lipstick top-looking mechanism that seals the door, but doesn\u2019t lock it, couldn\u2019t have been pushed all the way in, as in i might\u2019ve closed the door, but with the slightest of cracks, making me think i closed and locked the door, but that would just be absurd, so i dismissed that theory. \n\n\nBack to what happened, my mom scrambled for tools to open the door, and me already knowing that i\u2019ve already caused enough problems, handed her items from the toolbox to try and do something. My mom was gonna call the police, and i was scared as hell, thinking they were gonna arrest me, so i hid behind that one-man couch. I did everything i can to try to hide myself. The police came, noticed me, didn\u2019t pay me any attention after that and proceeded to head towards the door, i\u2019m not 100% sure what happened, but i think one of them was a lockpicker and used a sort of metal wire/paperclip that was unraveled to unlock the door (it was one of those handles that had a tiny hole in the middle for a key unlock thing). Estimated 3 minutes flew by, and something clicked, and i heard the hinges of the door swing open, i stayed in my hiding spot until they left, then emerged and apologized relentlessly to my little sister. \n\nI still have a guilty conscience about it though, so i thought I\u2019d come here for judgement",
