About five years ago he moved city and we lost all contact for awhile. But about a year ago they started calling me and wanted to talk. They had a tough time in school and never found a solid job. I'm sure they felt lonely and just wanted someone to talk to. What started happening is that they talked about subjects like anime and video games, stuff I'm not very interested in.\n\nThe calls felt one sided and I'd had enough after awhile and started making up excuses for them to not call me. They cought onto it after some time though and started asking question about why I did not want to talk. I avoided those conversations as well for awhile because I did not want to make them feel bad for telling them off.\n\nWhen they after months of me avoiding it approched me about it I told them how I felt. I said I had no interest in the calls and that I had more important things to focus on, I've just started my first full time job. I made it clear it was nothing personal but they took it very poorly and have not heard from them anymore.\n\nWhat makes me feel like an A hole is that the last thing they said is that they saw me as a very close friend. I can only ponder on if I was their only friend and if they went through depression now. What else could I have done? I did not want to keep taking calls, but I might just have ruined them.\n\nAm I the A hole here?",

It sounds like you lost interest in putting in the work to make this friendship work. Nothing necessarily wrong with that, as you are likely a very different person at 18 than you were at 13. \n\nMy advice: If your only regret is for how the friendship ended, then let it go and you're NTA. If you miss the friend, then call him back and work to make it a two-sided deal.",

That said, I feel for both you and this other person. \nUltimately you know the nuances of your relationship, and if you feel like you should reach out that\u2019s certainly okay too. Perhaps you could do or talk about things you are interested in for a change? \nLooking back on my own life, 34 M, I made regretful decisions of letting real friendships wither and die because I was caught up in chasing other things and impressing new people. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, it\u2019s important too. I also had to let some toxic friends go, because it was damaging to my wellbeing and that was very important and freeing.",
