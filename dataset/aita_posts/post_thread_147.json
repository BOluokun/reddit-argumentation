  "post content": "To give some background, my sister cannot have kids. She has wanted a kid for a few years but doesn\u2019t want one that doesn\u2019t share the same DNA as her (her words). She asked me if i\u2019d be willing to have a baby and give it to her and i said no. \n\nSo, my sister and her husband moved into my parents house as their house needs workin on. Shes said it would take 4-6 months before they could move back. My mom wanted to have a family dinner yesterday and had all of my siblings and i over.\n\nBefore dinner my sister asked if they could instead move in with us because it\u2019s closer to BIL\u2019s job than my parents home is and she didn\u2019t want to live with my parents. I asked my bf if it was okay and we agreed to let them stay with us instead. That was until she started making \u201cjokes\u201d during dinner that i seen as red flags. \n\nThey were along the lines of \u201cyou better hope i don\u2019t hide your birth control and you end up getting preggo\u201d I kind of awkward laughed then she said \u201cmaybe i\u2019ll poke a hole or two in your condoms\u201d by then i stopped laughing and started to feel off vibes. I tried to steer the conversation onto something else but she kept making the jokes. \n\nI didn\u2019t even last til the end of dinner and told her i changed my mind about them living with us because i didn\u2019t like her \u201cjokes\u201d. They all said i\u2019m overreacting and my bf backed me up and said it wasn\u2019t funny. We left and since then my siblings and parents have been calling me a drama queen and said i blew it all out of proportion and i\u2019m making it seem like my sister is a bad person. AITA?",

She threatened to sabotage your birth control in order to force you into a unwanted/unplanned pregnancy which would leave you with two choices that you shouldn't be forced to make because it would be a pregnancy that you had no hand in making true. She wants to force you into a pregnancy so she could somehow get the baby from you. (I can see her calling CPS on you for the smallest things in order to force them to take the child away and place it with her.)\n\nShe showed you her true colors, believe her. Do  NOT let her NEAR your house, and keep an extremely close eye on your condoms, birth control pills/patch/shot (whatever you use that isn't a IUD basically) and never leave her alone if she has access. They were NOT jokes, no one makes Jokes like that unless they have a mental disability in which they truly do NOT understand the impact this can have (meaning they hear people say it or its on TV etc, like they truly cannot understand the issue with htis), OR they have a hidden agenda. She has a hidden agenda. She WILL do this if you let her near your house. Please don't let her move in.",

I just learned that you can request to be put to sleep for IUD insertion, similar to sleep dentistry. IUDs are fantastic birth control. Extremely effective, long-lasting, one of the cheap bc methods when prorated over their multiple years lifetime (and in the US usually fully covered by insurance), and reversible between immediately (copper IUD) and a couple day (hormonal IUD) after removal. Both insertion and removal are quick outpatient procedures.\n2. Depends on which IUD model one gets. In the US market, options range from 3 to 12 years. Elsewhere, there are many more models available.\n3. Depends on the individual, as well as type of IUD. Copper IUDs are unlikely to stop periods, and for some people periods get more intense with these--at least at first. People with hormonal IUDs usually report getting milder periods or cessation. (Either of which is temporary. The hormone dose is quite low compared to The Pill, so cycle/fertility bounce back within days after IUD removal.)\n\nhttps://www.bedsider.org/methods/iud",

The insertion technique and pain relief options are always going to be the same and you will definitely cramp the next few days, but your IUD is going to be either a 3 year, 5 year, 7 year, or a 10 year IUD for hormonal IUDs. Non hormonal can last 12-15 years. Periods will vary per your normal flow. With my kyleena (insertion in July 2018) I have gone from flows that had me changing my super overnight pads and super plus tampons every two hours at the most and adult diapers at night for a week straight to 10-14 days of a very light flow with cramp pains being the same level as before my insertion for two years. This past year though, my cramps have gotten less and almost non existent for some periods and my flow has decreased as well. I definitely have enjoyed being able to use normal and new period containment methods like regular size pads and menstrual discs and will probably keep an iud in until I go through menopause or decide I might actually want to try to give birth",

Granted it's typically used against a person in the relationship and not a sister or mother but their is a old law regarding the sabotage of birth control by someone besides the person taking it in order to force pregnancy. (Though I'm sure the female could be in trouble for it as well but it's mostly targeted towards the males of the relationship since they are the ones who do the most in creating a pregnancy because yea they got the stuff needed) I cannot remember the law entirely it's just on the surface of my brain and in this case ALWAYS research or ask a lawyer. We ain't legal help or legal anything helpful. It was just something I remembered and was bugging at me to say something.\n\nI am truly concerned that OPs sister may do this to someone because they REALLY need help.

We had 4 dogs, mum was disabled and I had a stack of educational computer discs that hit my hip. i was 4'5 or close to 5' so pretty high stack, plus all my home school books AND my massive stack of \"return to library\" books. the caseworker was PISSED for the false report, because no babies were in the house and I was a really messy kid thus my room was a pigsty.

She sounds pretty desperate, but she\u2019s not desperate enough to adopt a child that does need a home. This can actually make her into a big risk for any children you decide to have, since she already has her gaze fixated on you, your eggs and any pregnancy you may have, and she\u2019s just assuming that if you do ever accidentally become pregnant, then the baby automatically becomes hers. \n\nOP, your sister made herself into a threat to you, she was not joking, she was being serious and she was forming a plan out loud (lucky for you she was saying it out loud.) Your sister sounds like she needs to be in therapy to cope with her infertility, cause it also sounds like she\u2019s never allowed herself to process it and it also sounds like she\u2019s never allowed herself to even think about her other options logically and realistically, which can be dangerous and it can make her mental health even worse. She needs to come to terms with her infertility, and she needs to maybe go over her options again before she ruins her relationship with you for good. \n\nSadly, it sounds like your parents are enabling her, which makes your sister all the more risky since she has them covering for her and they\u2019re in her corner. They need to wake up and realize that your sister/their daughter is suffering big, and your sister is heading down a bad road full of suffering if she doesn\u2019t get the help she needs. Instead of calling you a drama Queen, they should be shaking their heads wondering \u201cwhat the heck is my daughter(sister)saying?!*\u201d \n\nWhat are your parents going to do if one day you do decide to have a baby? Ask you to give your child away to your sister because she deserves it because she\u2019s wanted to be a mommy so long? And what\u2019s their plan for your sister once she realizes she really cannot have any children you bring into the world? They\u2019re not thinking far ahead when they should be, do they know ALL the details about her baby rabies? And how far her jokes are getting?",
