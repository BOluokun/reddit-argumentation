  "post content": "He\u2019s 16, gained muscle mass, got a haircut, new clothes and new (fake af) friends. And a whole lot of confidence. I was happy for him.\n\nYesterday he threw a tantrum because our parents didn\u2019t let him go into town at midnight in Spain. We are not from Spain. He wanted to bring home Spanish ladies so that he could fuck them. He told my mom to suck it, gave her the middle finger and slammed the door Cuz she told him no. I texted him we could go into town tomorrow, a little earlier and I would buy him a drink. He told me my parents would regret this day. Wtf.\n\nHe constantly talks about all the ladies that wants to fuck him and how they stare and drool. I don\u2019t see them, but okay.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m 19, I got out of bad relationship and really really enjoy being single with my smaller friend group of 6. I only know 30 people I want to invite to my party as opposed to 100, like him. We\u2019re at different places in our life.\n\nBut shit when he talks like that to my parents and tells me that I\u2019m the opposite of a sex god (when we literally look like twins, I\u2019m just a girl) it pisses me off. Am I the asshole for saying things like \u201coh what the 3 girls you have had sex with?\u201d \u201cYou mean your fake friends that you can\u2019t trust?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re really not THAT hot. And no you don\u2019t look 21, you look 16, just like you are.\u201d ? \n\nIt\u2019s meant as a \u201cget off your high chair\u201d rather than a \u201cI\u2019m out to destroy your self esteem\u201d.  He ruins our vacation with his constant sex talk and complaining.\n\nSo am I being the petty big sister or is he acting like a complete jerk?\n\nUpdate:\nThank you for the advice :) I had a little talk with him and explained why it\u2019s uncomfortable for me to know about his sex life and by the facial expression he gave me, it seemed to sink in. \n\nThere was even a Spanish girl who actually flirted with him (in front of me) and instead of him getting all cocky, we just looked at each other and laughed :D",
