  "post content": "Ok so I turned 18 last December and have asked my dad if I could have a party since before then since my older sister had one a few years back when she turned 18. And main reasons/excuses/whatever for not having them have been the lack of time and money. I don\u2019t even want anything huge just invite some friends to party and drink (legal age to drink is 18 here) and I hoped to host it at home for one night (same as my sister) especially since I haven\u2019t been able to host a birthday party in the past couple of years due to Covid I was hoping I could have one since I turned 18 and it was kind of a big deal at least in my opinion and thought hosting it at home wouldn\u2019t cost that much. But now it\u2019s been over half a year and I still want to have the party but I feel weird and like an a-hole asking for it because money has been somewhat though for the past few years and I would have to ask my step mom and siblings to stay somewhere for a night if I had the party and also since it is closer to my next birthday but at the same time I feel like turning 18 is a bigger deal than turning 19 but anyway Reddit what\u2019s your opinion and if you feel like I\u2019m the a-hole please explain why so I can try to not be in the future\n\nEdit: also as to why I don\u2019t just throw my own party since I\u2019m 18. For a couple of reason including the fact that I\u2019m currently a student without a job so I really don\u2019t have the money to  rent a place where everything costs 3 times what it would if I did it myself and also my sister got to have her party at home but that could just be the sibling rivalry and jealousy talking",

It sounds like there are legitimate reasons why you didn't get a party on or about your birthday. And there's nothing wrong with you wanting to have one. Though at this point in time, you may as well wait until the next birthday.",
