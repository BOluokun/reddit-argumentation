  "post content": "Sorry this is a long one but i need some opinions outside of my family. \n\nSo I (23 f) and my husband (23 m) got married in November. We are both happy and live in the house we bought before we got married. We are not currently trying to have a baby but we aren\u2019t necessarily opposed to getting pregnant. We have been talking about it for about a year and we both agree that we dont want wait a super long time to start trying. Last month i had felt off and had super bad morning sickness. So i decided to take a pregnancy test and it was positive. I was super excited and so was my husband. I made a dr. Appointment and when i got the bloodwork back, it was determined that i had a chemical pregnancy. I had gotten myself so worked up that i was heartbroken. We decided not to tell our families because my mother is the kind of person that thinks you should be married for at least a year before trying to have kids. So I really didnt want to get into it. \n\nA few weeks later, we had to go to the bank to get my moms name off my bank account (its been that way since i was 17) and put my husbands name on it. My mom offered to pick us up since she would be driving past our house to get to the bank. We agreed and didnt think anything of it. On the car ride there, my mom started talking about our finances. She said that we spend too much money and need to start budgeting. She says this pretty much every time we see her but this time she was getting onto my husband saying that he needs to do a better job at supporting me and suggesting that he get a second job. (Side note, he just had started a new job after being let go from a job where he made $26/hr for reasons that were not his fault.) I decided that i was not going to put up with this and it soon turned into a screaming match between me and my mom. Once it calmed down, she said \u201ci know about you OBGYN appointment. I hope you aren\u2019t pregnant \u201c. I immediately burst into tears and said \u201ci was but now im not\u201d. He response was \u201cgood. It breaks my heart to think ove you having a baby right now. You are too immature and not financially stable enough.\u201d The rest of the car ride was silent. \n\nNow, this past weekend, by brother (25 m) and his wife (24 f) who have been married for almost 3 years, announced their pregnancy and my mom was beyond excited. She was screaming, jumping up and down saying \u201cmy first grandbaby!\u201d. I acted the best I could and hugged them both and congratulated them. I excused myself to the bathroom when everyone was talking. No one was paying attention to me so i didnt think anything of it. I collected myself and went back to join the party. Everyone was still excited and happy i I assumed everything was fine. The next day, my mom calls me and proceeded to say how rude i was and that i made everyone uncomfortable and therefore stealing their spotlight. I didnt even know what to say so i just said im sorry and hung up. I havent said anything to anyone since but my mom is still texting me demanding I apologize to my brother and SIL. So am i the A-hole?\n\nEdit:: my husband was at the announcement. According to him, no one even turned around to see I wasn\u2019t there. They were all talking to each other. My mom is the only one who noticed so theres that.",

She only gets to give advice and that's even ONLY WHEN ASKED!\n\nYou need to have a conversation with your mom about how now that you are trying to build your life together with your husband, she needs to let you do just that. Tell her you'll ask for advice when you need help, but let you do this on your own first.\n\nHonestly, she doesn't sound like the kind of person who would understand/listen to this, but I don't know you or your mom, so I'm trying very hard not to say \"cut her off!\"\n\nNTA, OP!\n\nEdit: I had a miscarriage at 6 weeks (chromosomal abnormality, something incredibly common) and I grieved so much. I was excited and overjoyed about the pregnancy just like you were. When that's gone, of course we grieve! I just can't understand why your mother can't see that you were hurting and why she can't have empathy and compassion. Like someone said, she's a bully!",

I'm betting a long time.\n\nPut your mom on an information diet.  Stop sharing personal information with her.  Learn to grey rock when she's pushing your buttons.  She is doing it to get a response, to show that she is still in charge.  Don't react to it, answer with 1 word answers, give her nothing to feed off of.  Understand that while you did nothing wrong, you'll never be as good as your sister in her eyes.\n\nCheck out r/JUSTNOMIL for similar stories and how to cope with overbearing parents.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong.  I'm sorry for your loss.  NTA for feeling your feelings.",

She had a list of all the ways she can insult you and your husband. She was literally going through your bank account to spy on you and judge you. \n\nYour husband deserves better than that. Also, shut that account down and transfer it to another bank because she'll go right back in there and keep trying to get access to it. \n\nStop giving her your attention. Stop letting her treat you like this. Not all mothers are great or even good. Start detaching. If you don't cut her off, this is going to be the rest of your life. If you can't cut her off for yourself, do it for your husband.",

You have to learn to stop caring about her opinion, because no matter what you do she'll find a way to make you feel bad. She's had your whole life to figure out how to manipulate you, so she's good at it.",
