I told dad that I hate piano and I suck at it but he forces me to take classes 2 times a week and practice everyday but i\u2019m still super bad at it. The first recital was yesterday and i knew i would be humiliated in front of many people because i can\u2019t play very well so i decided to just not show up (I went to the park instead).\n\nWhen I came home dad was the most angry then i have ever seen him. He screamed at me a lot and he even hit me (he rarely hits me) and he said that i had been kicked out of the music school and they won\u2019t give him his money back for the rest of the year and he had bought me a piano to practice at home for nothing. Some mates from the school contacted me on FB after that and they were also really mad and told me that the whole concert was ruined because i wasn\u2019t there and they all had a bad day because of me.\n\nI feel like i was really selfish but I hate piano so SO much that i really don\u2019t regret it and i think i\u2019m mostly just happy i don\u2019t have to take lessons anymore. AITA?",

I hated it at first, and now 20 years later my best friend is someone I met in that troop.\n\nThat said, re-evaluating *after* the recital would be within reason, and the dad is 100% an ass for hitting.
