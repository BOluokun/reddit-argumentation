  "post content": "Normally, I\u2019m the one who cooks because I enjoy it and I\u2019m the better cook. When my partner gets home from work, the meal is usually ready or close to ready. She sets the table (it\u2019s just us, no kids) and usually she will wash her lunch box and immediately pack her lunch for tmrw straight from the stove. This is done before we\u2019ve even had a chance to sit down and eat the meal I\u2019ve cooked. I don\u2019t know why exactly but this behavior really annoys me. She says it\u2019s because she\u2019s tired after eating and doesn\u2019t want to do it then, but I\u2019ve pointed out that she can pack her lunch after she has washed the dinner plates and while I am putting the leftovers into Tupperware containers. This has also happened once or twice when we\u2019ve had guests for dinner. To me, making her lunch plate before anyone else has a chance to eat the food feels like self-serving behavior. She\u2019s literally serving herself first. Maybe it\u2019s petty, but it bothers me and when I mentioned it to her, she got defensive and said that I was creating a fake problem. While it\u2019s not a big issue, it is an action that makes me feel not good and she has the ability to change her behavior but refuses to. AITA and this is not a thing, or should she wait until after we eat to pack her lunch?\n\nEDIT: we had a chat about it agreed that when I cook, I will box her lunch as I plate our dinners, that way her lunch gets packed and put away and I don\u2019t get annoyed at her for swooping in on my hard work.

      "content": "YTA -- from your other comments, there is enough food to go around. You say that she's \"serving herself\" but it's usually just the two of you. Is there a concrete reason this upsets you, aside from her not following your preferences?\n\nIf the meal was prepped with the intention of saving some for leftovers, packaging it before serving is the much better way of doing it. It's easier to cut/portion neatly, you don't take too much OR not leave enough because you know exactly how much food there is, and it starts cooling much more quickly for safe refrigeration.\n\nYou need to examine why you're assigning so much intent to a seemingly innocuous disagreement; if it's just an \"agree to disagree\" petty annoyance you need to drop it.\n\nETA: Apparently a lot of people think people who pre-portion immediately stick it in the fridge while it's still piping hot, so here's how I do it:\n\n1 - Portion into Pyrex or other microwave safe container.\n\n2 - Leave on counter while eating with lid loosely set on top, so bugs/debris can't get in but steam can escape. *This will cool faster than if you leave the intended portion in the cooking/serving dishes while eating.*\n\n3 - When done eating, it will have cooled enough to be safely stored. Wipe any excess moisture off the lid, then seal and place in fridge. Proceed with cleaning the kitchen.\n\nThis balances the need for the food to properly cool so it doesn't get mushy or raise the temperature of the fridge, while minimizing the time the food is left in the \"danger zone.\"\n\nI do all the cooking in our house, and we cook our week night meals for leftovers because separate lunch fixings...in this economy? No way. Most dishes need to \"rest\" for a few minutes after cooking anyway, that's plenty of time to prep your containers so it's only an additional 30 seconds of time when you're already plating.",

She takes that away from OP. The meal they eat for dinner is a meal that has already been touched, and even if it's obviously still fresh, it's just not as satisfying.\n\nI know OP doesn't say they're a man, but let's be honest most people here assumed so as soon as they noticed that the partner was a woman. And yes, I believe it influences how people see that, because even if there still are way too many people who think women should serve men, submit to them and that kind of bs, I don't think that the people who commented here would ever go and ask a woman who cooks almost everyday for her husband to pack his lunch herself if she's unhappy with the way he behaves with the meal.",
