  "post content": "My daughter is 24 years old. For her entire life, she has neglected her teeth. Her dental hygiene is nonexistent, she would refuse to brush or floss her teeth at all, wouldn\u2019t even use mouthwash. My first thought was that she may be suffering from depression or some sort of mental health issue, so I immediately took her to professionals. However, even after years of doctors, therapists, medication, and specialists, my daughter still refused to take care of her teeth.\n\nI got multiple opinions from multiple professionals \u2014 they all said the same thing: \u201cWe don\u2019t know why she won\u2019t brush her teeth,  try xyz, there\u2019s nothing more we can do for you.\u201d\n\nI spent years crying, begging, bargaining, and screaming at her in an attempt to get her to take it seriously. She never did, but under my care she\u2019d at least brush her teeth occasionally (2-3x a week). I kept trying up until she reached adulthood and moved out. At that point there was nothing more I could do for her and I assume she completely stopped caring for her teeth at that point.\n\nRecently, she went to the dentist because of severe pain after putting it off for years. They discovered her teeth were pretty much completely ruined. She had to have most of them pulled. \n\nShe called me crying about how ugly she felt, and she begged me to pay for her to get crowns/veneers.\n\nI refused for several reasons. One, it would be incredibly expensive, we\u2019re talking upwards of 10k. Two, she got herself into this mess by not taking care of her teeth, despite me warning her throughout her entire life and doing all I could to help her. Three, she has yet to show she can maintain proper dental hygiene and without proper maintenance she will likely ruin the crowns/veneers anyways. I told her as much and said she\u2019ll have to figure it out herself.\n\nShe\u2019s obviously furious and thinks I\u2019m a huge a-hole. She is saying I\u2019m a horrible mother and betraying her by not paying for it. It\u2019s honestly starting to get to me and I\u2019m doubting my decision. I can technically afford it, but I would have to use money from my retirement fund.\n\nSo, here I am, asking for opinions from the Internet. AITA?",

I do think it\u2019s a disservice to patients to not educate them on why preventative care such as daily flossing is important after you get a crown put in , and I am glad I had a dentist that sat me down and showed me a video about how bacteria can form plaque in areas around the crown if I don\u2019t floss in the area well enough. \n\nMy comment was to drive the point that if OP\u2019s daughter got to the point where she is losing all of her teeth, she probably has other dental issues as well that would make her be extremely vigilant if she gets crowns put in, which won\u2019t be worth it because she can\u2019t bother to brush her teeth more than twice a week.\n\nLet\u2019s be real here being super vigilant for most people would mean actually flossing well everyday, most people don\u2019t floss.",

When I got my braces the orthodontist offered a 5% discount if you paid up front, otherwise you put a certain amount down (I can't remember the percentage) and paid the remainder off over the course of your treatment. \n\nEither way, if necessary, she *should* take out a high interest dental loan.  I paid 6 grand out of pocket for my braces (my parents couldn't afford braces when I was a teen so I got them at 30 years old) and I am extremely vigilant about wearing my retainer and taking care of my teeth.  When it's your money and your credit on the line, you suddenly become *very* responsible.  I can't say 13 year old me would have kept track of a retainer or wouldn't have slacked on wearing it, at the least.  But when I had to come up with 6 grand in 18 months, you bet your butt I'm going to make those payments and make the money worth it.",

She went to many specialists and I talked to her many times to get to her root issue but all she could tell me is she didn\u2019t want to brush her teeth. I want to make clear that I never once ignored how she felt or got angry with her (just frustrated out of concern for her well-being, and I agree yelling is never a good idea, I felt so lost and helpless).\n\nDoctors gave her multiple diagnosis, we tried many medications, we tried different methods but at the end of the day I can\u2019t force her to take care of her dental hygiene.

I'll admit I put myself here with my depression. I spent many years never expecting to make it past 18, never had ambitions/dreams/hobbies, nothing mattered except getting messed up and hurting myself, so my teeth weren't exactly something I cared about. Now of course I'm an adult with a partner, a full time career, and the knowledge of how bad tooth pain can really get. With the right support system I've just recently in the last couple years started getting things done. And in my awful reality,  I don't get veneers. I don't get partial dentures. I don't get caps. My insurance covers next to nothing and the surgeries alone have been hundreds. I'm currently walking around with missing front teeth, I constantly get asked if I smoke crack, I don't smile or laugh in groups of people I don't know very well, and every time I look in the mirror I want to smash it because that's actually my mouth and my screwed up teeth and my mistakes. My options when eating these days are breakfast essentials smoothies or mashed potatoes because I will cut my gums where my teeth used to be. I get where she's coming from. This existence is brutal, and it hurts. She shouldn't be freaking out on you, or demanding money, but I can't call her an AH for feeling desperate and ugly and afraid. I also don't believe she actually thinks you're a horrible mother, she's likely lashing out because she's realized how bad things really are and feels backed into a corner. This is not an excuse - but something to take into consideration. You're not an AH for standing firm on refusing to pay, at all. I really think the two of you should sit down together and maybe you can help her look at her options going forward, maybe somewhere nearby has payment options or maybe there are things in her budget that could be cut out and instead put into a savings towards getting whatever work she needs done. Sorry for the essay. This one spoke to me. Good luck to both of you, I truly hope she starts taking care of herself and can find peace with her current reality.",

Hating the whole process is something shockingly many people feel, according to my dentist.
