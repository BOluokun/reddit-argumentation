  "post content": "Pre-Covid I (33M) would go on family vacations with my family (My Parents (late 50's), Brother (27) and Sister (29)), these occurred about every other year.  For a multitude of reasons we haven't done a trip since 2018.  I am married and we have an 18 month old.  My sister has a boyfriend, and my brother has some sort of terrier and no GF I know of.\n\nMy brother has morphed into a self described \"dog dad\" and based off social media seems to rarely do things without the dog.  We live in the same city, but different areas and we don't see him all that much.  The few times i've been around his dog it behaves fine.  Its too friendly for me and I can't speak to how it behaves over multiple days or around babies.\n\nMy parents have a Vrbo beach house in Florida booked.  In a few week the deadline for a full refund for canceling is coming up and my parents need to know if we are in.  We live in the west side of the USA so we'd be flying.  I found out my brother plans to bring his dog.  My parents aren't thrilled about it but \"it is what it is\", those are my parents words.\n\nI'm not a dog person, I despise them on airplanes.  I do not want to travel with the dog (tentatively we are on the same flight), I do not want to stay the week in the same house as the dog, I do not want activities based on being dog friendly, and I do not want the dog around my son.\n\nOur parents want to stay out of it and have us hash it out.  I broached the topic with my brother.  Essentially he isn't flexible on the dog, it is his family and it is a family vacation.  He says my 18 month old will be far more annoying and loud than his dog.  He seems firm on this and i'm ready to pull out of the trip.  If I don't go, the trip may fall apart.  WIBTA?",

You can leave a dog home alone for a few hours if people want to eat at a nice restaurant. It's rude to bring a baby to a nice restaurant, they have bed times and they scream at movies. Kids are awesome- but you're on a different planet if you think the vacation is going to revolve around the dog- it's going to revolve around your baby.",

I mean, I absolutely understand having a problem with badly-behaved dogs (or other animals) on planes (and I adore dogs, most especially my three pups), but it's pretty rare for a dog to spend an entire flight howling and barking, whereas babies... are perhaps rather less likely to be quiet on a plane. Infants, in fact, are probably the least disruptive on a plane; they can't move about under their own steam, don't kick seats, and sleep a lot. Toddlers (which is what OP has) *can* move around *and will want to*, will probably protest (vocally, and possibly loudly) at being restricted to a seat the whole time, and are likely to do things like kick the seat in front of them. \n\nAlso, OP complains about \"tentatively\" taking the same flight. How is that even worth complaining about? Schedule yourselves on different flights \u2013 or book tickets on the same flights, but just don't sit next to each other.",

My brothers, both divorced by then, wanted to do things that weren't age appropriate for my nephews. Think cliff-diving, etc. They assumed my parents or I would take care of their sons. My parents informed them that parents get a vacation from work and home, but not from parenting. A dog can be left at home at a doggie hotel or with a petsitter but it's nuts to think the dog is going to be harder to care for than a baby.

Your brother is most likely correct in that your child will probably be more of a hassle than his dog. Your Brother is your brother and your parents are in their 50s. Going every other year, how many more of these vacations do you think you all have left together? But, I will relinquish that it is your family and your vacation so you have every right to do whatever you want.",

I can tell you that you're being judgemental and not acknowledging what people are giving up for you and your family, while getting annoyed at just the idea of the dog coming. Because vacationing with an 18 month old is much more restrictive and possibly stressful than a dog- especially to those that aren't responsible for them, as long as the dog is well behaved. Babies cannot be left alone, their only method of communication is crying, they  rely even more so on a schedule- and object loudly when it is broken. I would much rather be on an airplane with a dog than a baby, and honestly you're the first person I have ever heard say differently... Also if the dog is well behaved it's actually healthier for your child to occasionally be exposed to animals.",

The cats always just avoid and leave the room.",
