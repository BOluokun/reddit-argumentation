  "post content": "My friend moved in with me and my 3 year old a couple months ago with her 4 year old and cat. she is mostly only here when she has her kid but the days the kid is with her dad, my friend is hardly ever here, and is over at her boyfriend\u2019s house \n\nShe does come to make sure the litter is cleaned, and the cats (because i have a cat too) are fed before she leaves, but she\u2019s really never here. \n\nIt was an entire month of her leaving the house right after getting home from work, spending some time with the cat, then going straight to her boyfriend\u2019s. Most nights she doesn\u2019t even sleep here. \n\nShe was starting to leave when i asked her if she was going to her boyfriend\u2019s. She said yes, then grabbed her keys. I stopped her and said we really needed to talk about her constantly at her boyfriend\u2019s. She said \u201cwhat is there to talk about?\u201d I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her going there almost everyday if she was going to live here and that there needs to be boundaries. \n\nMy friend said how she is there every night that she has her kid, and that she only leaves when she doesnt because that\u2019s the only time she can see him. She stated that she would invite him here but she wants to be courteous to myself and my son, so she just goes over there and ends up staying the night so that she isn\u2019t coming through the door very late when my son is sleeping. She asked if this was about her leaving the cat there some days, and mentioned that this was not something I told her would be an issue when establishing house rules\n\nI told her it wasn\u2019t about the cat, it was about her never or hardly being here for days at a time, when she lives here. She said she wasn\u2019t gonna just not see her boyfriend and didn\u2019t understand the issue then walked away. This made me feel confused and now i\u2019m wondering if i might be wrong? AITA?\n\nETA: she has also said that she shouldn\u2019t have to adjust her social life just because she moved in, but i\u2019ve told her it\u2019s my house, i have rules and boundaries , she\u2019s moved into it and I feel like she can move in with her boyfriend if this is really a problem",

I am trying for the life of me to figure out what the problem is?\n\nDid OP hope to get a free babysitter for her kid? Does she want someone to pay her to be her friend? Does OP have feelings for this friend?\n\nI don\u2019t see what this person did wrong or why OP is upset to the point of throwing the friend out. Sounds like a perfect roommate to me. I kept waiting for this horrible thing the friend did and she just got better and better as a roommate.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards. And since I forgot YTA OP.",

I understand and accept that I cannot control or change another person. To say that personal boundaries are a form of control over others implies that I have some level of power and authority that I can wield to force compliance to my demands.
