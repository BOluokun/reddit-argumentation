My younger daughter (13f) wanted them as she's been learning to ride. \n\nMy older daughter (17f) was against them, she's much more \"princessy\" and didn't want to deal with the mess and chores that come with horses, but we told her it wouldn't be something she'd have to deal with and that her younger sister promised to take care of all of it.\n\nWell, recently the older daughter has been disrespectful at home and staying out too late, and her grades have been slipping. \n\nWe warned her to shape up, but last week when we heard that she'd been needlessly insulting to her younger sister while I was our running errands, I told her that she'd be cleaning out the stable each day for the next week as punishment, and that her sister would get a break.\n\nShe got really upset and offended, and said we promised she'd never have to go in there or have to scoop horse poop. I said I promised it wouldn't be one of your chores, of course, but obviously a punishment is supposed to be something outside of your normal chores and something you won't like, and I thought it was perfectly fair here.\n\nShe's been doing it three days now but seems to be very resentful of our \"broken promise,\" acting very disgusted, and keeps begging to get out of the rest of it. But I said I thought it's very fair and that she's overreacting.\n\nAITA?\n\ntl;dr Made older daughter clean stables as punishment despite saying she wouldn't have to, she thinks the punishment goes too far.",

So many parents jump to infraction \u2014> arbitrary sucky punishment as their discipline model and it just doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nBased on this post, as an example, the issues with the older daughter are: disrespectful at home, staying out too late, grades slipping, and insulting sister. So the logical reaction is\u2026 take care of horses that aren\u2019t hers? No.\n\nA logical consequence for staying out too late would be, she has to turn in her car keys for some length of time, or she\u2019s not allowed to go out for awhile or something.\n\nFor grades slipping, they need to get to the cause of the problem and react accordingly. Does she need tutoring? Is she in too many extracurriculars and needs to drop something? Is she staying out late enough that it is interfering with her sleep (so addressing the former problem should help)? Is she depressed? Is she dealing with some kind of high school drama? Is she playing on her phone too much and needs her phone taken away for a bit? There are lots of directions this could go, but taking care of livestock isn\u2019t helpful.\n\nAs for the disrespect and insults towards family, that deserves a serious conversation to start with. Maybe a punishment of some kind is warranted, but it should be more relevant to what\u2019s actually going on.\n\nYTA",

At 17, is she taking too heavy of an AP load? Does she need a little support?\n\nStaying out too late - sounds like its time to discuss the curfew and why she is breaking curfew. If the reason is arbitrary, then she loses the car for a week.\n\n\"Needlessly disrespectful to her sister...\" YTA. A BIG MASSIVE AH. 13 year old girls are obnoxious as heck - you really expect your 17 year old who is stressed about school and likely sees the difference in the way she vs her sister are treated to just take this laying down? ANd you really thought the best way to handle this was giving your 17 year old a week of cleaning out stalls for horses that do not belong to her and she never wanted and has no connection to as a punishment?\n\nLady, I have 4 kids. I am FAR from a perfect parent. But your favortism towards your second child is palpable. Check yourself. YTA. Check yourself. Check your words. Check your actions. Check your behavior. Check your tone. Check your treatment of your first child. Was she REALLY disrespectful or did 13 year old just tattle to make trouble? Is it possible that 13 was harassing big sister and big sister got sick of it and finally let loose? \n\nCancel the punishment and PAY HER for the work she did all week. Apologize profusely for behaving the way you did. Apologize for favoring child number 2 and believing her over child number 1 without a lick of evidence. Apologize for not talking to her about why her grades were slipping and jumping to the conclusion that she was being lazy.\n\nThen, solve the underlying problem with her. Give her GRACE because at 17 she is likely stressed beyond belief about school, keeping up her extra curriculars for college apps, SATs, and maintaining any sort of social life. The pressure kids are under... whoa boy. Its a doozy and instead of talking to her you just added more literal $%!7 to her load. How exactly does mucking stalls help her grades? How does it improve her relationship with the sister she now likely resents even more than she did before?\n\nYou screwed up BIG here! REALLY big here!",

I've had to teach teens to clean stalls, they mess up. They sometimes forgot to check under clean looking bedding and I (also a teen, but with experience dealing with this literal shit) showed up after a few days (long school days) only to push deeper into the straw/shavings, pick it up and find days-old dirty bedding full of flies under the clean. Simply because the horse in the stall rolled or moved around and it moved some clean bedding onto the mess. So the horses' environment might suffer as a result of this. Not due to neglect, but simply due to the daughter forgetting or not knowing to do it because even properly cleaning stalls is a learned skill. \n\nNot to mention sometimes, you simply gotta clean stalls with the horse inside, i.e. move the horse or work around the horse. Is this girl comfortable around horses and able to safely handle them and be around them without getting kicked?\n\nTLDR: It's not just a bad parenting decision, it's also a bad horse-owner decision. Cleaning stalls properly can be hard for a beginner, as can safely handling horses.",
