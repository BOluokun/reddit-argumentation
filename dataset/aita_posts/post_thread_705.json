  "post content": "Disclaimer: English is not my first language so expect some grammatical error.\n\nI, 24F, is in a relationship with my boyfriend 29M. We are in a healthy relationship and I know the existence of his daughter from his ex. I still accepted him and love him unconditionally despite all of that. By the way, I\u2019m still in college finishing my second college diploma, single and has a part time job. Given that, I promise to compromise with him since I know he is giving financial support to his daughter for her daily needs like formula milk, diapers and emergencies. I keep understanding his situation despite all of that because I love both them. On the side note, his cheating ex left her daughter and my boyfriend during the 4-month of the child leaving my boyfriend heartbroken and nothing. My boyfriend\u2019s family raised his daughter with no trace from the girl for the first 2 years. My boyfriend even persuaded his ex before to get back together for the sake of their family which the ex refused. Over the past few years, my boyfriend was in a relationship already with some females and this ex kept bugging and begging him to get back together which my boyfriend declined. Last year, the girl decided to take their daughter and ask money from my boyfriend for his financial support to the child. At first, I don\u2019t care how much money he gives since I\u2019m the one providing for us two. But I noticed from the past few months that the ex was asking more than twice than the supposed \u201cfinancial support\u201d. They didn\u2019t have a written agreement about this and it\u2019s too expensive to hire a lawyer from my country. We don\u2019t have much paternal rights or courts to support this claim. Apparently, this ex has vices too like smoking and drinking. On top of that, she doesn\u2019t have work and we don\u2019t know why. I was so mad about this and told him to stop sending money to his ex and just send groceries. I even offered to pay for the child\u2019s insurance in case of emergencies which the girl refuses since \u201cit will not help them\u201d. From this day onwards, the ex blocked my boyfriend together with his family and refuses to communicate nor give my boyfriend his visiting rights to the child. So, I am the a$$hole for banning my boyfriend from sending money to his daughter?\n\nEDIT: it\u2019s been a while since I haven\u2019t read what you guys thought. Anyway, I forgot to mention that the baby mama has been in a relationship too with a single dad of 3 kids. They have been compromising my boyfriend\u2019s child and keep asking money from my boyfriend.\n\nUPDATE: Ever since we have stopped giving her money for 1 month, she left their child again with my boyfriend because she can\u2019t afford to pay for anything now. We may suck for y\u2019all but we don\u2019t think she deserves any money from us. Again, we are not from United States and we don\u2019t have financial agreement about this and she stopped my boyfriend\u2019s visiting rights for 3-4 months. We asked his daughter what happened during her stay at her mom\u2019s place and she keeps telling us that her mom will spank her anytime and showed us a lot of bruises. The child was brought by the baby mama\u2019s sister in my boyfriend\u2019s house. We have no contact with the mom because she doesn\u2019t want to give her address. It maybe a messed up situation but I\u2019m thankful for all your thoughts.",
