  "post content": "I have a high school friend, Diana, whom recently got her Masters degree. She lived in another city and we barely ever saw each other and she was always \u201ctoo busy\u201d for long phone calls so we only talked briefly every now and then. \n\nDuring the time she spent on her degrees, I managed to get married and start my own family. \n\nDiana was visiting her family and we met up for lunch. I asked her about her degree, work prospects, etc. (She did her masters in translation or interpreting or something like that) and she said she got the job but will have to move to Brussels. I told her that\u2019s crazy. If she can\u2019t find a job locally, then her degree was a waste of time if she has to move to another country.\nShe said it\u2019s an amazing job opportunity that she couldn\u2019t get anywhere around here (apparently the job is related to EU parliament or whatever, I admit it, I lost her with all the abbreviations she was using). \nShe again said that it\u2019s an amazing opportunity and she\u2019s excited.\nI asked her about the pay and she told me. I said that my husband earns that without a degree so I was right about the Easter of time and money, and she said it\u2019s  starting salary and it\u2019ll grow because the first year I saw pretty much training and being in a junior position.\nI again said that she could\u2019ve gotten a similar job here and wouldn\u2019t have wasted 6 years Andy instead could\u2019ve already work Andy start a family.\nAnd here\u2019s where she was rude, she said that if she was to be as unhappy as I was, she didn\u2019t want a family\u2019s. She threw in my face that apparently I\u2019m always complaining about my husband but I\u2019m criticising her, he\u2019s the best husband in the world.\nI told her she\u2019s ridiculous and mean and she called me an asshole, paid and left the restaurant.\nI to,d my friends about this and they\u2019re split in who\u2019s the asshole here so tell me, Aita for telling her the truth?",

It's something that, IMHO, is the norm in the US and it's sadly prevalent across all levels of society. The feeling that the USA is the greatest and there's no need to learn about other cultures, languages, etc. And also, your point about domestic life: if someone wants to marry and have kids and be a stay-at-home parent and be happy with that, I totally support it (even though it's not at all what I want for myself) if that is what truly makes that person happy. But to bitch about it and dismiss another person's dream because it doesn't align with yours? Yup, that's called Jealousy with a capital J.
