The gift card is enough to cover a decent meal for two at this place. \n\nBefore I had a chance to use it, things went into lockdown and the restaurant has since been either closed, outdoor dining only with very limited capacity, or takeout only. \n\nJust last week things opened back up here at full capacity for the first time in nearly a year. \n\nThing is, I know restaurants have been struggling, especially the smaller locally owned ones. WIBTAH if I used the gift card to pay for our meal when my spouse and I dine there this weekend?",
