  "post content": "So my 20 year old daughter is currently a college student. She lives in my house free of rent. I only ask her to do a few things around the house from time to time, like cooking and cleaning. Typical things you're expected to do on a daily basis anyways. Occasionally she has to watch over her younger brothers since I may be busy with work or when I need a break to hang out with my girlfriend. \n\nMy daughter recently spoke up to me about how she feels I'm putting too much of a workload on her back which I don't see how. She told me she's okay with cooking and cleaning around the house, but having to watch over her siblings was annoying & stressful and that it's taking away from her studies. That pissed me off because I myself went to school while having to pay bills & take care of her as a baby alongside my ex-wife. I told her she was acting very privileged and that if I could do it, so could she. She didn't like that very much and stormed off into her room. \n\nWell she went behind my back and told my sister about how \"bad\" I was treating her. My sister is very kind & gullible at times, so she called me and said the least I could do was give her an allowance for the chores I make her do. I explained why I felt that wasn't necessary and she told me not to compare my situation to my Daughter's since apparently I put myself in the position I was in back then which I guess is a fair argument. But since she is living in my house rent free and I'm paying for her college, I feel that in of itself should count as an allowance. So I just wanted to ask whether I'm wrong for not wanting to pay her extra money to do basic chores.\n\nEdit: So in regards to how often I ask her to babysit, it's usually 3 times a week. I don't see how that's too much to ask of her. It's usually only for a few hours until I get back home. My boys are twins & they're 5 years old. They aren't crazy kids by the way, they're more mature than the typical one's you'll see.",

              "content": ">There\u2019s more for us to learn.\n\nYep. Profs I've had have said the same thing. \"If I was going through this same degree in today's age it would be much harder\". Because the information we have on any given subject is exploding exponentially every single day. We have so much more info to absorb now but degrees are still only 4 years long on average. The information density is what makes it hard. \n\nPlus the fact that with hyperconnectivity intruding into our lives more and more with time, the demand for our attention has skyrocketed and ability to focus has sharply declined. The technical term is \"continuous partial attention\" and it's been a phenomenon since the late 90s, but has progressed significantly in recent years, especially among millennials and zoomers. It's unfair to say that the responsibility and blame rest entirely on the individual to block out all distractions. Nowadays, colleges expect students to download apps that will notify students of changing course info, new locations for lectures and labs, reminders, messages, and everything else. Lots of lectures involve doing polls and quizzes from your phone. Add on to the fact that social interaction and networking plays a massive part of the college experience, and disabling social media is an unrealistic expectation. In fact the social damage caused by blocking out social media would be arguably worse than the effects of its distraction. But the fact that we have to manage that additional layer of responsibility, while carrying around devices that constantly scream for our attention, is something that previous generations of students didn't have to manage. It was so much easier to separate work from play, and valuable info from noise.\n\nAnd finally the flexibility of degrees has also changed dramatically. When my mom's generation was in school, most families were not sending their children off to college. So the predominant societal model was to enter the workforce and begin your \"adult life\" directly after high school. Colleges offered a lot more \"work while you study\" type of arrangements, like night classes and prolonged degrees (i.e. programs explicitly designed to allow you to juggle your college workload with raising a young family). Nowadays, post secondary education is basically non-optional, so the predominant societal model is that you continue to live off your parents into your 20s, and continue to be a full-time student for at least 4 years after high school. Because of this, the flexibility of degree programs has shifted. Yes there are still online/night classes, but the quality of education will not measure up to that which is obtained from being a full-time student. The most in-demand degrees are taught during daytime hours and have very little flexibility for alternative arrangements. And now more than ever, it DOES matter that your degree is in-demand, because a couple generations ago, having ANY degree was what made you stand out in the workforce. Now that so many people have degrees, it's the SPECIFICS of the degree that matter most. If you don't fully commit to the strict requirements of the \"right\" program for your field, then it's almost as bad at not having a degree at all. So many young people can't find work after graduation for exactly this reason. So OP expecting their daughter to sacrifice their schooling in this way could severely impact the rest of her life. It's a generational difference that's not very well understood, in my experience. \n\nMy parents didn't understand when I was going through it, and expected me to hold down a full time job and \"just take classes at night\" like they did. Ignoring the fact that my degree was accredited and therefore only offered certain courses during the day, all my project groups operated in the daytime, and lab work had to be done during daytime lab hours. I barely had time to take care of myself let alone try to hold down a job, and the intensity didn't lessen for the entirety of my 5 year program. My parents response was that I should just go to a more flexible school, then. Well, the majority of my peers who went to those schools couldn't find relevant work for nearly 5 years after graduation. Being 5 years behind in your career progression is a LOT.\n\nTimes have changed. And it would be great if older generations would listen instead of insisting they know better.",

He did his freshman-sophomore years at a local community college, and his freshman year was almost 100% remote learning due to COVID.  He lived at home, rent-free, while in college.  He'd spend HOURS on the computer every day for school.  Sometimes, I'd just see him as a blur running into the kitchen for food before his next lecture began.  \n\nYes, he had chores and responsibilities.   \nHe has 4 younger siblings and has ALWAYS been a big help to me.  If I asked for help, he'd drop everything to help.  But that's also who he is as a person.  In return, he knew that if I asked for help, it was important.  I very rarely bothered him, as I feel that his education is his full-time job.  We had a schedule of chores we both agreed on, and whenever he was available to help more, he'd offer.  If he told me that he was burdened by what I asked of him, I'd take his concerns seriously and try to address them. I have a wonderful kid, BTW.  \n\nBut he also deserved downtime and a way to decompress from the day/week. To assume that a student's down time is free time is wrong.  They are stressed just as much, if not more than we are.  They need time away from responsibilities just like we do.\n\nAnd not for nothing, if I'm paying for college, I believe in my child and would like to see a ROI of them being a happy, successful adult at the end of this.  Why would I stress them out by forcing chores/babysitting duties on to them that they cannot handle?  That's a bit counterproductive to my investment.  Their grades might slip, they could lose a scholarship that's essential to their education, they could become depressed and begin to suffer mentally.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nOP: YTA for the way you spoke to your adult child, who is only trying to communicate her feelings on babysitting.  They aren't HER kids; they are YOUR kids.  Would it be nice if she helped?  Sure sure.  And perhaps, if you weren't such an asshole, you could have had a good conversation about when/where you need help, see if you two could come to an agreement on it, and show your child she's a valued member of the household while making sure she recognizes your contribution to her future financially.  \nBut no, parents do what parents do and use the whole \"When I was your age\" BULLSHIT LINE that NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR.  That's basically telling someone to STFU and deal with it.  That's not a solution, that's a damn guilt trip.",

My reason for this, I got a full ride that only paid for 4.5 years worth of undergraduate education and I wanted to make the most of it (housing was included in my scholarship). \n\nMy room was always a mess and I often fell asleep in the shower.

But nowadays it's getting harder to get a job, harder to graduate, and the housing market in  America is for shit.\n\nSo we have this disconnect where our parents think we're being lazy and not doing things how they did it, but we literally can't with how the world works today.",
