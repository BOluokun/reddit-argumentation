  "post content": "Background: picture a long narrow townhome with a combined living / dining, then stairs and a doorway to a kitchen behind. I have a rectangular dining table that can seat 6, but in the space seats 4; 2 chairs on each long side. If any chair is moved to the ends / head of the table it either blocks the stairs or the doorway to the kitchen. \n\nFor whatever reason, even though it\u2019s just myself (35F) and my children (13m \u201cmike\u201d) and (8f) mike always moves a chair to the end blocking the kitchen door. I have asked repeatedly he not do this. I can\u2019t get dinner to the table (we use this table for all our meals) without squishing myself against a the wall like a contortionist or waiting for him to get up and move. Repeat this 3x a meal at least 3x a day and you get the point of how annoying this is. Note: for large meals, I turn the table and get the extra chairs from the attic and for the 2-3x a month this happens it\u2019s no big deal. It\u2019s the every day occurrence that\u2019s an issue. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is my mother, grandma (old, F), does the Same. Exact. Thing. She comes over at least 4x a week for dinner. She is larger than mike, so squishing past is not an option, and I\u2019m left to crawl through the pass through from the stair landing into the kitchen because that takes less time than asking her to move and waiting for her to dramatically grunt and get up and push her chair in. \n\nHere\u2019s the question: last night, after taking care of 2 sick kids all week, I got their illness. But worse. I got hit with a 104.6 fever and fell asleep on the couch. At about 2am I woke up dying of thirst and while barely able to stand, I tried to make my way in the dark to the kitchen for water. I fell over the stupid chair, which was at the end of the table, again. I have literally begged every day for the past 3 years to stop putting the chair there. I had enough. \n\nI got out my screw gun. I screwed the legs of all 4 chairs to the coordinating legs of the table so they cannot be moved from the long sides of the table. It is now like a fixed fast food table with attached seats. Mike woke up and called grandma complaining and the two of them are telling me I\u2019m crazy and this is uncalled for and I am overreacting because I\u2019m sick. They are also mad that I hid the screw gun and mike can\u2019t move \u201chis chair where he wants\u201d I responded that it\u2019s my house, my table and chairs (which are old and since I\u2019m in construction I could fix the holes easily if I so chose). AITA?\n\nETA: I keep being asked / told to get new furniture. 1. The table / chairs DO fit the space if the chairs stay on the long sides of the table. It\u2019s a 6\u2019 table. Each person gets 3\u2019 of space if they just leave the chair alone. 2. Sitting in front of the door gives the worst \u201cview\u201d of all 4 sides, looking out the window at the roof of my 15 year old car and neighbors siding, so it\u2019s not a preference of some gorgeous picturesque landscape either.\n\nEdit: the word \u201cend\u201d to \u201cside\u201d because maybe that\u2019s why there was confusion over me needing a new table?",

This is absolutely unacceptable, especially because your son is at an age where he is already naturally prone to not wanting to listen to his parents anymore. And she's basically telling him that he doesn't have to listen to you. Grandma needs to be out of your son's life for a bit, because she is teaching him to be a rude and entitled AH and it is going to take some serious work to undo all the damage she's doing to his behavior. Grandma is not a good influence. You are the parent, put your foot down and don't let interfering relatives spoil your son.",

Do you find yourself thinking, wow I sure wish this woman behaved like a normal person so I don't have to deal with this shit all the time? Because if so I have good news for you: You can ban the betch from your house! This won't make her behave properly but you will not have to deal with it. Being a grandma is a privilege not a right. Having a relationship with grandma can happen at her house, no? Or the park? She can take the kids to Mackie ds like every grandma out there who does not have dinner with their grandkids 5 times a week. You in therapy? Not dissing you I love therapy.  You need it hard-core. You are ALLOWING these things to continue and therapy can show you how to stop doing that as much. NTA for this but you need to open your eyes to the situation and stop allowing this woman to step all over you. You have all the power here. Use it.",

Sorry, but you need to not have her in the house until they both drop it and get with the program. Do not engage with any reference to the table or screw gun, if they're engaging you in this mental warfare, they've already gotten the advantage.   \n\n\nNTA, but you're being an AH to yourself and your kids if you keep letting this kind of behaviour fly unchecked. 3 years is 3 years too many already.",
