We\u2019re in a distance relationship (he lives in Prague, Czechia and I\u2019m studying in Switzerland), so we see each other once every 4-5 weeks, and I usually travel the 7 hours because he has his own apartment and I didn\u2019t have my own until recently.\n\nI\u2019ll be done with my exam period in 3 weeks and then I\u2019ll visit him for a week and a half. Today he announced to me that his friend is getting married on the 12th of February, the only weekend we have together (and he\u2019ll be at work during the week). Alright, I\u2019m not thrilled but it\u2019s an important event for him and I\u2019d never keep him from attending. However, 1. The wedding is somewhere in the countryside and we\u2019d have to rent a car for the 8 hour round trip. I\u2019m not thrilled about this because it\u2019s one day after I traveled 7 hours for us to meet.\n2. I don\u2019t know a single person there, which seems like it will be a bit strange. I also speak don\u2019t speak their dialect of Czech and will be the only \u201coutsider\u201d there.\nFor these two reasons I told him I don\u2019t really want to attend and I\u2019ll happily stay home while he goes. He seemed quite unhappy and disappointed and gave me the silent treatment for a while. \n\nIt sucks because it\u2019s one of our three full days together that\u2019s kind of wasted. But driving for 8 hours and then going to some stranger\u2019s wedding is not what I envisioned after not seeing each other for over a month and a half :/",

It's fun!).\n\nAnd if you end up going to the wedding, make some exit plans in case you need a break: bring an enchanting book and find a somewhere to hide for 45 min, or excuse yourself to take a walk, maybe bring a camera to take pictures of nature or the building... Allow yourself some downtime by choice so you won't feel so overwhelmed and lonely by the difficulty in communicating with so many strangers.\n\nMake the best of it; be selfish, and be a happy wedding guest.",
