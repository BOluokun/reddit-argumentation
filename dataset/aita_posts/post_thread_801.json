  "post content": "(Sorry if my formatting sucks & its kind of long)\n\nSo, in January I(F23) moved in with a close friend(F42) & her son(20) because she offered better & cheaper rent. \n\nOne of our issues we have & found a comprise to was having guests over after she went to bed because even though we were quiet she still didn't like us walking past her bedroom & opening the front door because it disrupts her sleep. The comprise was that she would close her bedroom door & I would turn down the alert system so it didn't beep everytime we would open the door. \n\nSo this is where I might be TA: My best friend(M28) got off work & came over at 2AM. I know its late but we both work nights & it was my day off & I wanted to see him for an hour or so. Plus, its only two nights a week that he comes over that late. We had only been hanging out for about 30 minutes when my roommate texted me to tell me something a long the lines of \"I thought we agreed no guests past 10PM\" which no we didn't agree to that at all. I didn't reply & sent my BF home. Then around 9AM she texted me & told she decided no guests over past 10. I went & asked her son if me & my BF were loud last night & he said no; so I left it at that & went to bed. Now, I'm not going to lie I have a bit of a temper sometimes so I knew not to reply or have a discussion with her about anything until I knew I could be calm and composed. \n\nWhen I was walking to my room tonight while on the phone with my BF & she stopped me & said we needed to talk. I said I was on the phone & wanted to sit down & eat my dinner. She said too bad & that we were going to talk anyways. She was visibly angry & I knew neither one of us were in the right state of mind to have a calm & productive conversation so I said we can tomorrow but not right now.\n\nShe started ripping into me & followed me into my room to continue telling me it was disrespectful of me to talk to my BF about me & hers issues & that I was disrespectful for having him over the night before and just laying it into me, honestly. I just kept telling her she needs to walk away, she needs to leave my room, & just leave me alone but she said its her house & she can do whatever the hell she wants. I let my anger get the best of me & said I didn't care about her or her sleep & that she needs to walk away or I would call the police. She started yelling even more but left my room. I went back to the phone & started angry crying to my BF. \n\nEven though he saw where I was coming from he said I shouldn't have lost my temper at the end & that I shouldn't have threaten to call the police. He basically said it was an asshole move & it did make me look like I didn't care about her. My question isn't just was I an asshole for saying that stuff was I also being the asshole for having my BF over late at night even though me & her agreed that it was ok?",

I feel as if she\u2019s grouping you in with her child in her mind. So, when you do something she wouldn\u2019t let her child do it\u2019s an issue for her. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t let her son have guests over at 2am. That is probably a big no no for him, so she\u2019s applying that same rule to you. It\u2019s hard living with people that are older than you because you guys don\u2019t live the same life. You\u2019re not in the same stage of life. She\u2019s been there done that stage that you\u2019re going through. The dating, I just want to see you, I just wanna spend time with you stage. The cupcaking lovey dovey stage. So, she isn\u2019t going to relate to you or see where you are coming from. I would just sit down and have a conversation with her and let her see where you are really coming from and explain to her that you are not her child, you are her roommate who pays to live here and you should feel comfortable to do what you want in your home as long as you aren\u2019t causing a disturbance.",
