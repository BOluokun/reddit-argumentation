  "post content": "Hi, first time poster, on mobile, all that stuff :)\nSorry, it's going to be a bit long. Summary at the end.\n\nSome background, I have pretty severe anxiety and a history of doing more than my fair share of group projects since I worry about them not getting done otherwise.\n\nI'm currently at Uni and working on a project  with three other students. I should start by mentioning that this project is divided in 2 parts, one group-assignment/report and one individual report. \n\nAs per usual my anxiety is acting up and I estimate that I've done about 70% of the group-assignment so far. Despite this I have no problems with two of the three members of my group, they always show up and do their best. The work so far is based on our discussions and ideas so they still do work.\nBut this third student... \n\nShe skipped the first couple of lessons were we laid down the rules in the group (respect,being on time, critique is welcome but not negativity, etc.) Which means that she wanted us all to write separately in a shared document even though the rest of us already agreed that we'd work better together, continuously developing our ideas.\n\nIn our almost 17 page long shared document she has written less than a page and only because we told her what to type.\n\nShe missed an important meeting were we ended up making some major changes, however I summarised the whole thing and put it in the aforementioned document for her to read - she didn't. \n\nShe skipped out on both a seminar and a work shop aimed at getting dead back from other groups so we can make changes before the presentation. SO THAT SHE COULD WORK ON HER OWN ASSIGNMENT.\nShe also doesn't want to meet up this week to fix the changes even though the presentation is only a week away (again - anxiety).\n\nSo today I finally did it. I sent my teacher an email and abandoned the group. I will be doing my own report on the project (Which I came up with by the way).\nI even left them with the document and all the work I've done so far.\n\nNow here's the kicker: she told ME that I was being unfair for calling her out on not doing any work and now she's pissed at me. She thought I was being rude for assuming she didn't do any work because she spent that time \"on her individual report\".\n\nI feel sorry for the other girls but as mentioned that still have access to all my work and notes leading up to this point.\n\nHelp me see this from her POV.\nAm I the asshole?\n\nSummary: I do 70% of a group project while another girl skips meetings to work on her own assignments so I leave the group with a week left to deadline.\n\nEdit: Clarification. I did not want to kick her out because with only a week left she would not make it. I left them with all the work and notes I had done up until this point so we are just working on the same project with the same resources, I'm just doing my report separately.\nThey still have my 70% of work and get to take credit for it as long as they paraphrase it",
