  "post content": "Friday night was spent shredding it up at the local skatepark with a group of friends. I leave my wallet, backpack, key\u2019s, and beers by my friends things so it\u2019s all grouped together. A grom we normally skate with came over and told me there was a kid hanging out by our gear and looked suspicious. So I immediately skate over to where he is. The kid runs into the porta potty while I\u2019m approaching him. I go and check my bag and behold, my wallet is missing. I run over to the bathroom he\u2019s in and politely ask him to give the wallet back. After about five minutes of him denying taking anything he finally opens the door and hands me my wallet. He\u2019s got a brand new longboard in the stall with him so I snatch it and said \u201cit sucks when someone takes something from you huh\u201d.  Instead of calling the police, I gave him my phone number and said \u201cI\u2019m keeping the longboard until your mother calls me.\u201d  AITA for taking this kids board!?",

I dont disagree with what you did, I agree with making sure his mom knows he's a hooligan, but your logic here is hard to follow. I think you did the right thing, but you're still an asshole especially if this is how you justify it. More importantly, this kids rich mom pretty much has proof you stole her kids shit (even if it was \"justified\") and she might not take it was well as you did finding out your stuff is gone, and might flip shit and call you for reasons other than an apology.",
