  "post content": "My mother passed away last year. And the entire process is about to come to an end in just a few weeks. \n\nFor the past six months, my husband has been looking at a multitude of things that on a regular day, we definitely can't afford. He'd have to use credit or save up for weeks or months. A person can wish for stuff or want to work towards a treat for themselves. But he hasn't made an effort to save up for these expensive purchases. \n\nInstead he's been asking for updates on the legal process and asking how much longer it's going to take. He's even asked me several times about an estimated amount. I've given him very little to no information because at this time, things can still drastically change. With a creditor popping up and saying that money is owed or etc.\n\nHe's not the most responsible person with money. I've manage the finances full time for the past three years straight. He used to manage our finances. But he has a history of sabotaging our financial goals and blowing our budgets. \n\nMy intention is to use half of my inheritance to move our family into a house. Then save 40% to help my children in the future. Like graduations, college, trips, their first cars, etc. And have a small emergency fund. \n\nSomething we couldn't do before because my husband kept giving money to his side of the family to help them with bills, groceries, legal troubles, etc. Draining our accounts and leading our family to homelessness three separate times. I understand that if it's family, you have to try and help somehow. But letting your three children and wife become homeless because an adult family member couldn't be responsible enough to pay their own bills or got into legal trouble is a hard thing for me to fully understand.\n\nI really don't want to wake up one day and find out that every cent has been spent behind my back. I'd like to open an account in my name and follow through with the plan I mentioned above. He has made it clear that intends to buy a new vehicle, tech, game system and other items just for him. Not our children or to improve our family's future. \n\nWhen I talk about investing or saving, he says that life is too short for that. I told him that it wasn't about us. It was about our children. And his response was that when our children become adults, they should work for what they want.\n\nThat statement seems backwards considering his actions as of late. I know for sure that if his parents pass, we will have to pay off their debts and cover all of the unknown costs out of pocket. Financially speaking, started my marriage with my husband completely debt free. And I have worked for years to finally get him to be debt free as well. But over the past ten years, he's paid off his parents credit card and IRS debts. They live paycheck to paycheck and think saving money is pointless.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm making the right choice. But I really just want my children to have the same happy and stress-free childhood I had. \n\nAm I The Asshole?\n\nEdit: I'll post an update on Tuesday.\n\nEdit: Update.\n\nThank you to everyone who gave me the advice I needed. My Mom was the only person I trusted enough to ask for advice on serious issues. Thanks for the awards and giving awards to those who gave me sage advice. I wasn't expecting any responses and my post to be buried by more interesting ones. Maybe five at most.\n\nSome people asked questions that I would not like to address. On the off chance that my husband, his family or family friends find this. I would like to keep those details to a minimum. So I can have the time I need to leave and ensure that my children will be properly cared for and safe. \n\nYou're all correct, I was a sh*t parent in the past. I was too focused on making the money to for our financial goals and not paying attention. I was too trusting without doing my due diligence. For that bit, I can accept responsibility and fight tooth and nail to make changes to be a better person and parent for my children. \n\nI spent two days lining up appointments for the first week of October. When I know I'll have time alone to handle everything privately. I found a divorce attorney, a financial advisor and a bank that's a bit out of the way. I also made an appointment to visit the firm handling my Mom's estate to find out what my options are with them. Everyone was correct about their assumption that I live in the US. That's the most I can say. \n\nSome things to clarify:\n\nI truly am unsure if what kind of financial ties my husband has created with his family members. That's why I said that if his parents pass, I'm sure there will be debts to pay. But I'm definitely not going to be around long enough to finance it.\n\nA lot of people asked how I could be with him. And he wasn't like this while we dated and after we got married. It probably started midway through my fourth pregnancy, with our now first born. It made sense that all of the trouble we faced, just to have a child, could have drained us. I believed because we kept all of our bills paid and filed away. \n\nMy binder of medical bills was three inches thick. From my first pregnancy to the day our first born came home from the NICU. With that in mind, I just accepted it as the blanket reason for everything each time. He would reopen that wound about how expensive it was for all of that. How it's going to be more expensive the next time. \n\nI purposely had a birth control procedure done after I had a near death experience with my last child. I did it for health and moral reasons. I never told him about the procedure.\n\nI'm still with him because my situation isn't so cut and dry. I had to dig our family out of hole and got an apartment. I tried to create as much stability as possible to focus on my Mom. All of this came out around the time I was taking care of my Mom. From the day I first took her to the hospital last year, I had to table it until now.",

How on earth are you even entertaining the idea of giving him any kind of access to a large amount of money? Looks to me like he has told you, many times, what he's going to do with that money. He's going to blow it. Just like he has been doing. He's going to blow the money, your investment plans, and your kids futures. \n\nSorry but...I'd have divorced his ass ages ago. If you hand out my money to the point of making me homeless, there's no way in HELL that trust could be earned back.",

He is openly planning to financially abuse her yet again after celebrating her mother's death all because he believes it means he gets new toys all for himself. Even if he can't access this money, he will just go in debt and force her to repay the loans with her money later on, likely to avoid a fourth homeless period.\n\nHe neglects his child and wife in favor of helping his own leeching family, to the point of *repeated* homelessness.\n\nHe manipulates and coerces his wife, because she's been convinced he's \"a decent father\" and that she will be responsible for his parent's debt. She's all worried his awful leech family will judge her for dumping an abuser! Her normal meter has been utterly shattered by this selfish narcissist of a man who cares *nothing* for her or his children.\n\nHe's super disrespectful to OP.\n\nHe is a bad father, but even if he was a good one, so what? He can be a decent father *somewhere else* just as well, without her having to support and pay his way while putting up with his terrible treatment of her. \n\nStaying with a man like that for the kid's sake actually does ***far*** more harm than being a child of divorced parents. That mentality of an unhappy home -where one parent mistreats the other- being better than a \"broken\" divorced home needs to die. It's a proven myth. It also sets a terrible example of what a healthy relationship looks like, so kids who grew up with parents who were unhappy together grow up to think that's normal.\n\nMy parents hated each other. My sisters and I desperately wished they would divorce from the time we were in middle school, but they felt they had to \"stay together for the kids\". All it did was make for an unhappy, stressful home, where we grew up thinking that was a normal marriage, and eventually got in our own unhappy relationships. \n\nI hope OP reads the hundreds of comments telling her to get herself free of her abuser and takes heed before he makes them homeless a fourth time. An actual decent father and husband would never allow his family to go homeless because he'd rather buy toys for himself and support his leeching adult family members, let alone twice or three times.\n\nIf OP stays with this man, thier fourth period of homelessness will be just around the corner. She will never be able to hang onto that money if she stays married to him, he will get it eventually through blackmail, coercion, manipulation, or just plain old theft. She will have no home they can keep for long, nor any college funds for the kids, because he's 100% convinced that money is all his, all for his own fun toys, and he will never give up until he has it.",
