  "post content": "I'm turning 22 in a few days and I have been asked what cake I would like. I wasn't expecting any cake because I'm an adult now and I have a 1 month old son, so I haven't put much thought into it. But I naturally answered that I wanted a red velvet cake because it was my absolute favorite and I don't get to eat it but like once in 5 years because I just don't think about it much. I don't eat sweets much (not counting pregnancy) so I was thinking, why not? \n\nThen I was given a lecture that I'm not the only one eating cake so I should get a flavor that everyone can enjoy. I understood this so I said why not get a vanilla or chocolate cake for everyone and then I can get a small 1st birthday type red velvet for me then. \n\nThen I was given a lecture about appearing selfish to the guests. And when I didn't want to back down and give up the red velvet cake I was accused of being an A-hole. \n\n\nI don't feel like I'm the A-hole here but I want to find out the truth. If I am the A-hole then I'll apologize and surrender the flavor I want and just have cake by myself a few days later or something.\n\n\nEdit: the people asking then lecturing me is a tag team of 4 women who are not related to me. It's my boyfriend's bothers wife, her mom, her sister, and their friend.\n\n\nEdit: (UPDATE) it's been 3 hours since I asked you guys AITA and according to the 200+ comments and advice I've gotten I can now say I'm NTA. Now I feel kinda sad that I wasn't able to recognize for myself that I wasn't the A-hole. I made this post to help me because I had such anxiety over it and felt horrible. My bf finally got home from work and when I told him he was livid. He called his brother to have a personal talk with him about his inlaws. I didn't want to cause any more drama but hopefully the little talk will help me not be treated like that in the future. \n\nAlso to answer some of you guys questions and also to clarify. \n\nI can't uninvite them Because I didn't plan the party. I was just gonna spend my day watching tv and helping my newborn with his tummy time to strengthen his neck. My Bf's brothers inlaws were the ones that wanted to be \"nice\" and throw me a party since I never had one before. So I kinda felt like the A-hole because I didn't want to be rude to the people who were \"nice\" enough to throw me a party. \n\nAlso I live with my bf and son in the basement of his brother and wife's house due to financial issues. So I'm forced to see her and her family very often. But we hope to be moved out by Christmas this year. \n\nTHANK YOU ALL FOR THE JUDGMENT AND ADVICE! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Someone said I should just get my own big red velvet cake and eat it Infront of them while they had their \"boring\" cake \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I kinda want to do this but I also don't want to cause more drama. \n\nMy birthday is August 19th so I might come back with an edit and let y'all know what I actually end up doing. Thank you guys!\n\nEdit UPDATE BIRTHDAY 08-19-2022: \nso I ended up cancelling the party. I know they wanted to throw it for me but I just didn't feel like doing anything. I was already kinda upset in general about past birthdays and family forgetting me (close family like sisters and stuff) so I just stayed up till 5am watching the Goodfellas because I haven't seen it. Then I slept till 7 to feed my baby then slept till 12. Then I hung out with bf watching YouTube and eating left over pizza. Then he took me out to dinner with his brother, his daughter, his other brother, and her gf (she is my friend. It's not the one being mean over cake). The waitress became my friend, and then I drove home (I really wanted to drive..) everyone at dinner came over and then just as I was about to go to bed, everyone began to sing and a red velvet cake with my name on it came dancing out (bf was dancing lol) I wasn't expecting cake Because at that point I didn't care anymore. After cake I went to bed and that was the end of it \u2764\ufe0f I had a blast. And the AH apparently got some karma, because she and the others got sick and wasn't in attendance. \n\nThank you everyone for letting me know about whether or not I was the AH. Also thank you for all the recipes and advice!!! Also HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THOSE WHO HAVE THIS BIRTHDAY WITH ME!!!!",

One yr when I was maybe 12 or 13, we were at my brothers house visiting for Christmas (my bday is Dec 23) and I didn\u2019t get a cake or was even allowed to open ip presents until his kids went to bed cause they didn\u2019t want the kids upset they couldn\u2019t open up presents early. But my dad ended up surprising me with a tiny cake from Carlos Bake Shop. We had to hide the cake as well until the kids went to bed. It was a struggle but the cake was delicious. Get the cake you want in the size and style you want. Maybe have fun with you SO and make it together!
