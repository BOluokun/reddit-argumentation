  "post content": "My BIL (married to my sister) is a general contractor. About 10 years ago, my dad and brother was building a deck at my parent\u2019s home. They asked my BIL if they could borrow his skid loader but he said no. They prepared the ground as best they could without the skid loader but got to the point they couldn\u2019t go on without it. They went to my sis\u2019s house to ask again but found out BIL went out of town. They talked my sis into letting them borrow it so she took them down to his construction lot and they hooked it up to dad\u2019s truck. \n\nThis next part I\u2019m not sure of since I don\u2019t know much about towing but from what I was told, dad\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t big enough or powerful enough to tow the skid loader on the dump trailer so he lost control and wrecked. The truck, trailer, and skid loader was totaled. The insurance was barely enough to cover the medical costs and the truck. There was none left over to cover BIL\u2019s stuff. When he got back to town, he exploded. He threaten to sue and things just went downhill from there. My parents are not rich and he wouldn\u2019t have gotten anything so in the end, sis talked him into letting it go. \n\nHowever, from that day on he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with our family. He doesn\u2019t come for birthdays, holidays, nothing at all. Next month is our parent\u2019s 50th anniversary and we\u2019re planning a big family gathering to celebrate. We\u2019re also chipping in to send our parents on a cruise to Mexico because they\u2019ve never been out of the country. I spoke to sis about it the other day and she said she\u2019s coming with the kids but BIL is not coming. I was fine with that but when we were discussing their portion of the cruise money, I heard him yelling in the background to deduct their portion from the cost of the skid loader and dump trailer. That pissed me if so after my call with sis, I called BIL and told him to get over himself. I told Dad and bro made a mistake but that was 10 years ago and he needs to let it go. He said he\u2019ll let out go when they give him the money he lost. I told him he\u2019s an ass for holding on to a grudge and putting money in the way of a family relationship. \n\nSis called me a few minutes ago and said they\u2019re not coming and that I was out of line. We argued for a bit and that\u2019s where it stands. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong for telling him to let go of the past but they\u2019re not coming to the anniversary party so now I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAnswers to your questions:\n\nLet\u2019s get something straight. My dad and brother are not bad people. They are good people who made a mistake. They couldn\u2019t pay back BIL because he wanted almost $70,000 and again, we\u2019re not rich. Dad had to buy another truck because he needed it to go to work.\n\nOn the other hand, BIL had 3 other sets of skid loaders and dump trailers on his lot that day so he could take the financial hit while my parents would be homeless. BIL and sis are way better off then the rest of us so while I understand your reasoning of paying BIL back, he doesn\u2019t need it.\n\nThe cruise to Mexico isn\u2019t some millionaire trip. The total cost is about $3,000 and it\u2019ll take over 20 people to pay for that. Again, we\u2019re not rich. We can barely cover $3,000 spread out over 20 people so there\u2019s no way we can pay $70,000.",

In the UK this would be an at fault claim, and more likely than not outside the scope of insurance because they were towing beyond their vehicle limit.\n\nParents should be grateful all he's done is ignore them - I would've sued. Courts (again in the UK) set up payment plans, so their relative lack of wealth wouldn't be a major issue. Beyond that, I would've also reported it stolen.\n\nTo be fair about this though, the sister shouldn't have let them have it against his wishes - it wasn't her stuff to share.

Let that sink in. Whether he needs it or not, your family is obligated to MAKE THINGS RIGHT. FFS. You know what's sad? I think if BIL saw your family showed remorse and did everything they could to make it right, your BIL may have forgiven this by now.\n\nYou'd be lucky if your sister and her family still want a relationship with you lot.

I can smell OP\u2019s entitlement through my screen. \n\nMy dad owned a successful heavy machinery business for 35+ years. Back when I was in elementary school, he also did heavy machinery rentals. There\u2019s a reason he only did rentals for two years. Even when my dad did everything right in terms of screening renters, having air-tight liability waivers, etc, it was a stressful, logistical nightmare. Even as a kid, I was aware of how stressed out and worried my dad was all the time when his machines were out there and how relieved he was every time he got them back. \n\nTaking the cost of the actual machine out of the equation, operating skid loaders or other heavy machinery can be extremely dangerous. \n\nOP, your BIL didn\u2019t say no back then just to be petty. It was a massive liability for him and his business and he didn\u2019t want to risk it. Your father and brother are actually terrible people for going behind his back to steal it. And guess what? The second worst case scenario happened as a result. \n\nYour father and brother had zero regard for your BIL and his family\u2019s livelihood. So by proxy, they did a terrible thing to your sister, too. The money to replace that skid loader is the least your father owes him at this point. YTA and you should be grateful your BIL never sued your father.\n\nEdit: typo\n\nEdit 2: Wow, OP. Rather than accept what you and your family did was wrong and that it still negatively impacts your family to this day, you decide to double down and try to justify the behavior. Frankly, this makes you look even worse. You clearly have a chip on your shoulder BIL has a successful business IN SPITE of what your family did. Yes, it financially hurt him. Stop lying to yourself. What your father and brother did was wrong. If they did this to anyone else, that person would have filed a police report and sued your family for damages. Do yourself a favor and try some self-reflection. You clearly need it.",
