  "post content": "I (27F) have two close long-distance friends, R and S. Almost a year ago I escaped an apartment fire, but I lost everything, including my cat. I struggle with moderate depression and he wasn't registered as an emotional support animal but he pretty much fit the bill. My mental health has been a roller coaster since then with a big increase in depressive spirals.\n\n4 months ago R told us her dad, with whom she already has a strained relationship, was diagnosed with prostate cancer, that she was seeing a therapist, and may be distant for awhile. From previous discussions I know that R, unlike me, does *not* like to talk about her feelings. She's complained about her husband, in-laws, and other friends trying to pressure her into talking when she'd rather be left alone, so I sent her a message that said \"I won't call because I know you need space, but I want you to know that you can call me anytime.\" A month later she let us know that they were able to contain and start treating her dad's cancer, and that therapy was going well.\n\nCut to now, R and I had been working on a pro-bono project together, but I\u2019d been falling behind trying to keep up with my full-time, pretty high-stress job in between depressive episodes. I finally sent her a text explaining that I dropped the ball, apologized, and asked if she wanted to schedule a call about it. No response. I later sent a text in our group chat asking if they'd like to get together. I got a nasty text back from R saying that she wasn't interested in seeing me because she'd been depressed for awhile and I would know this if I ever bothered to reach out. Quiet stretches are normal for our group so I was pretty shocked. I went back through my messages and it seemed typical for us, a few spurts of conversation every month or so, and one prior attempt from me to get together.\n\nI texted R privately to apologize for not reaching out. I said that I had been trying to give her space and hadn't realized she had been feeling ignored (true, but it's not like I was righteously considering her needs the whole time, I was also busy being in my depressed hole). I said I would check in more regularly if she needed. I got an immediate text back saying things like \"I took your silence as a sign\" and \"It doesn't really seem like you care unless the situation revolves around you. I was there for your crisis, but you weren't there for mine\".\n\nI called S, worried that maybe she was feeling neglected too. I did my best not to divulge R\u2019s private texts, but she had obviously seen the first text in the group chat. She also let slip that at some point R and S got together, the subject of me came up, and \"R was feeling a certain way\". I feel like there's a bit of a double standard here. Maybe I didn\u2019t reach out enough, but I can't know what R needs if she doesn't tell me. And R *was* there for me after the fire, but my trauma doesn't just go away because she\u2019s hurting too. AITA for not reaching out to R enough?",

Sure, you can have done more here and there but given your situation, I think you have done your part and tried your best. I would say it is your friend's problem for not having communicated clearly what she needs as you have offered them both space and help but she decided against it. However, I also think since she's suffering, it's understandable why she might react this way. It's not fair for you but people sometimes can't help it.",

If she had wanted to, she could have messaged you something like 'I'm feeling a little lonely and would love to hear from you'. Your group of friends sounds fairly mental health literate, and this type of support seeking without taking negative emotions out on others is one of the most fundamental steps in promoting recovery. Instead, R chose 'I took your silence as a sign' - a guilt-trippy, buck-passing comment that implies you were expected to read her mind. No doubt her words came from her worst moments, not her true self, and you're right to recognise that she's in a tough place. But it's still not on you to anticipate her needs when she doesn't communicate them to you.",
