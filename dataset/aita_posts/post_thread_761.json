  "post content": "So, during the quarantine my brother (33M) and his girlfriend Melanie (32F) were staying at home with us and that was fine, at first. I told them to sleep in my bedroom, since I have a double bed and he doesn't, and they accepted it. My brother doesn't have the bigger room because he left home years ago to live with his then girlfriend, so when he came back he got the smaller room. The problem started when they decided to STAY in my room like... forever. They stopped asking me if they could and slowly started moving their stuff. He said once jokingly that I had the room during the day and he had it during the night, but the thing is - THAT'S NOT EVEN TRUE!! My mom stayed in my room during the day because it was \"more quiet for her to work\" and I couldn't use my bedroom for literal MONTHS because every time I would say anything to my parents they quietly told me to suck it up and \"they're going to move out soon\". I couldn't even use my bathroom and had to move my stuff to the half bathroom downstairs. They eventually left and I got the room back. \n\nAfter the pandemic, I moved to another place country and started college there. My parents also moved and now they live in a coastal city to enjoy their retirement. I'm coming home for christmas and so is my brother, his now wife Melanie and their 18 month old baby, Annie. I love my brother and SIL, I love my niece even more, but when my brother started saying shit like \"don't settle into your room just yet\" and \"don't worry, we'll make good use of it\", I lost it. I was so mad, I screamed at him (we were on a facetime call) and melanie also got mad at me, saying that they NEEDED the room way more than I did, because of Annie. I said that if that was the problem Annie was welcome to sleep in my room with me but they can sleep separately for once and suck it up. My brother said I was being a selfish bitch and was going to sleep alone in a double bed while one of them would have to sleep in a mattress on the floor, and said I couldn't take care of Annie properly. I said \"Well I had to deal with you, an adult sized toddler who throws tantrums when he doesn't get his way, my whole life, so I think I'll be fine\". Both my brother and Melanie blocked me and they told my parents. My dad actually defended me and said that it isn't fair for them to take my room when I'm only staying for 2 weeks, but my mom said I was being a brat and it wouldn't kill me to lend my room for some days, since it's not like I'm living there.\n\nI feel bad for snapping at my brother but I also don't want to give up my room, the little time I have home I would like to spend there.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Sorry for the missing info, I'll try to clear this up: this is the house I grew up in, my parents moved but we are all going back for christmas with the family. \nMy room was never my brother's, I was trying to explain why he had the smaller room since he is the older brother. \nIf they took my room, I would be sleeping in the office, not another room. Grandma is staying and obviously she gets the other room, sorry for the confusion everyone.\n\nall that said, I do think I might have overreacted lol thank you for bringing some sense into me, I think that because my brother sometimes acts entitled it triggered something in me from last time they did that. I'll let them have the room for baby Annie.",

If you were posting this during the middle of the pandemic when you had been kicked out of your room, I would say they were the only AHs here.\n\nThat said... \n\n>My brother doesn't have the bigger room because he left home years ago to live with his then girlfriend, so when he came back he got the smaller room.\n\nSimilarly, you have since moved away and so this is no longer your room to claim, either.  It's your parents' house and they can make the room assignments as they see fit. \n\nPersonally, I'd rather sleep in a smaller room alone than in a bigger room with my 18-mo. niece. That sounds like a surefire way to be assigned childcare responsibilities on top of everything else.\n\nESH.",

The fact is it was my room and I like to stay in it sometimes and without even thinking about me or my feelings you decide that you needed more and then call me names about it instead of at least acknowledging that I might have some feelings or want to stay in there sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand it works better and it\u2019s not like I want you to be uncomfortable. And you know how much I love my niece, but as far as how you handled it and how entitled you were, that hurt me very deeply so I guess you need to decide now that you have what you need if you even care about what I feel.\u201d",

There are cheap platform beds on lots of online sites, and cheap mattresses as well. It might circumnavigate the issue. Or, and this wouldn\u2019t be as ideal, what about agreeing to switch your and brother\u2019s bed?
