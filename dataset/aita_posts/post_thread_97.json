  "post content": "My husband and I are in are late 20s (27 and 28). We\u2019ve been together for 5 years, and married for 2.  he began playing a phone game called Marvel Contest of Champions. And he managed to spend almost 60k dollars. \n\n58k isnt a small amount to us. Last year our combined income was 219k (67k for me and 152k for him). Although he should be making more soon. \n\n\n\nAfter seeing our bank statement, I sat him down and said that this type of thing can\u2019t happen. And that for the sake of our financial future we\u2019d have to really watch his spending. And it would need to be controlled for the foreseeable future. \n\n\nWell he made a Reddit post, and someone said I could get more replies here. Since he tried to use 1 saying I should cut him some slack as an, *I told you so*.\n\n\nAnd after showing him the replies that contrasted the 1 he showed me.  he basically said I was an A hole. \n\n\n\n\n I did contact Apple, and got a lot of it refunded. 53.7k to be exact. Just the 2 huge concurring bursts of purchases. The others littered throughout the month, and the ones exceeding the 60 day period weren\u2019t refunded. I couldn\u2019t come up with a plausible explanation to get them Refunded without looking to suspicious.\n\n\nwe had separate accounts.  But I decided I needed all our money in 1 place to keep an eye on it. And him. From now on.\n\n\nSo am I the A hole for cutting him off?",

Some kind of cryptocurrency? Sometimes I can't tell) to the tune of thousands of dollars. \n\nYou name it, I've seen it. Email from a guy whose fiancee recently died tragically and was just now learning she spent tens of thousands on eBay with his credit card. Older gentleman who bought thousands of gold bullion on credit. People who seem to be spending their money on international calls or chats \u2014 likely porn once it's over a thousand dollars and the charges are constant. \n\nOne dude opened a credit card, made a transaction as large as his entire $25,000 balance to pay scientology, and then just never paid it. One email from a customer furiously railed against us because we \"allowed\" her to spend $15,000 over her credit limit (can happen for any number of reasons) and she was a shopping addict who went to Hawaii on vacay. Total balance was probably close to 50k.  Transactions were mostly designer shopping. \n\nOne woman said she was financially struggling after Covid hit because her husband lost his job so now she was paying for all the expenses and I pulled up all her transactions and her checking account showed that she'd just dropped $500 at chanel, $750 at Barney's and for *months* had been going to a cheesecake bakery multiple times weekly where her cheesecakes were $50-$75 every time. \n\nI've seen people spend close to $10,000 on the home shopping network and QVC *in a single day.*  Enough transactions and it will usually crash my system when I try to review it lol. The low end of this is when kids spend like $1,000 on Xbox, apple, or Amazon Kindle because they don't know or aren't being watched. When adults do this it happens like op described. \n\nIt's definitely possible he spent it on OTHER stupid things but people can and do spend thousands on micro transactions, QVC, cheesecake, high end designer shopping sprees, gold, Xbox, porn, etc all the time.",
