  "post content": "edit: I want to clarify two things. \n\n1. I am her dad, not sure why everyone keeps referring to me as her mother \n2. Everyone keeps telling me the grade due date is actually the post date. If I was allowed to I would post the link so that you could see that the calendar literally says \"December 19th: Grades Due From Faculty\" and \"December 20th Grades Posted\". She literally admitted to lying that they were due Sunday (today) so I'm not sure why people are so stuck on insistng I'm wrong about that  \n\n\nI'm 54 and daughter is 28. She is home on break from grad school getting her phd. She's only home for two weeks because she says she doesn't have any more time even though she has a month break. That's been a big thing with her lately, she is constantly to busy to do things with us or help us out even though she does have the time.\n\nI got my younger daughter a sweater and it turns out she already has it. I called my older daughter from work on Friday and told her she needed to run and exchange it for a different one. She said ok, she'd do it the next day. I said it needed to be done that day to get the best options and she said she was grading so she can't. I told her that it's not like she can't pause her grading, run out, and exchange it. She said she wasn't going to slow down her work and just said that I should do it when I got back from work that day. I said I was busy to and didn't feel like running out after a long day of work and she said neither did she. But she doesn't have a \"long day of work,\" she's sitting on her ass on her computer all day and doesn't even have scheduled hours to work, she can do it whenever she wants.\n\nToday things really kicked off because I needed her to pick up an online order for a gift for my mom, her grandma. She again used the excuse of grading (she hadn't even started working yet, it was in the morning and she was drinking coffee and having breakfast.) She said that she needs to have her grades done by today but I looked it up on the website and she has until Monday evening so I called her on her BS, and she said she had \"other work\" due on Monday so she needed to get the grading done today (but wouldn't enlighten me on what this mysterious \"other work\" is). I said well tough, this needs to be picked up today so I can wrap it and I was going into the office so I couldn't do it. She said that if I don't want to do it myself, then it will be done on her own time. I told her with that attitude she can stay somewhere else and she said \"happily\" and packed her things claiming she didn't want to stay here anyway but was only doing so because I insisted. She left her gifts and said to not expect her for the holidays and she'll go to her girlfriend's family instead. I think it's ridiculous that she is throwing a fit just because she can't constantly live like she's the only person on the planet but my wife and other daughter is now furious with me. So I figured I'd ask here because my younger daughter is always reading the stories with me. AITA or am I correct that my daughter is self centered and childish?",

They are still asked to chip in with chores and duties around the house because \"it's just school\" or \"they aren't working\".

It seems clear that he doesn't view what she does as \"real work\", which is honestly really sad, and the fact that he's mystified as to what \"other work\" she has beyond teaching/grading tells me that they *do not* have a good relationship.\n\nIf you've ever met a graduate student, it's generally pretty hard to get them to shut up about their research interests once you get them going on it. That OP's dad is struggling to figure out what else his daughter might be doing tells me that he probably has little to no idea what it is that she actually studies. \n\nGood for her for setting boundaries.",

Studies show that people who take these little breaks can maintain their cognitive endurance longer throughout the day, have higher productivity, and overall cognitive functions (like memory, executive function, etc) are improved after these breaks. \n\nThere\u2019s so much more on cognition and highly recommend looking into the Allen\u2019s Cognitive Disabilities Model as it really shows how cognition changes throughout the day and what can affect cognition. \n\nJust fun fact for ya.\n\nAlso, OP you\u2019re AH.",

Working 60 hour weeks isn't a real job. \n\nTurns out my dad was jealous and felt threatened that his child was getting a PhD. He didn't even finish his bachelors (and has successfully lied about it for 30 years, saying he's got one in computer science). I have a BS and PhD in a multidisciplinary STEM field. I was a very successful grad student. And that success somehow threatened him, a grown ass man who had a job of his own, and that meant he needed to take me down a notch at every opportunity, including sabotaging me when possible. The grading situation in this post? EXACT same thing happened to me. \n\nI went no contact with him a while back and while I do miss having a dad, it's really nice not being actively sabotaged just because I don't fit in his box of what an ideal child should look like. And yet he has no problem bragging to others that I've got a PhD nor does he have any issue trying to take credit for it. He seriously tried to take credit for me being successful at my graduation by posting on fb about it but couldn't be bothered to even text me \"congratulations\".\n\nIt's all about maintaining control and trying to uphold the \"image\" he wants.

It's not just taking classes yourself in order to get a degree like it is in undergrad. A PhD by definition requires you to make a new, significant contribution to the research in your field. This is a METRIC FUCK TON of work that in itself is a full time job. Add on teaching (the daughter likely has a teaching assistantship) that's anywhere between 15-25 hours a week and between all those things you're doing you effectively work 50-60 hours a week most week and you're getting paid peanuts for it, assuming you're getting paid at all. Many PhD programs come with funding in the form of assistantships but even unionized universities pay barely enough to live off of and don't always waive tuition, so there's a decent chance that even though the daughter is getting paid to teach she may actually be having to PAY to get her PhD. So in addition to all the work she already has to do, add in living near the poverty line and having to constantly worry about how bills will get paid. \n\nBut because you're \"still in school\" you can't possibly have a real job, right? Teaching isn't a real job. And his errands are clearly far more important than her obligations.\n\nI'm so salty from reading this post and wish there was some way I could give support to his daughter.
