  "post content": "I'm getting absolutely chewed for this and I'm not sure if I made the right call here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis morning I woke up and my pregnant girlfriend was laying in the shower because she had been puking for the past couple hours. This isn't entirely irregular at this point, but it really sucks and wrecks her day from the start. The water helps her nausea. I go in and check on her and go back to getting ready.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQueue my roommate walking into my room and asked me to ask her to get out so he can shower for work. Thinking this is a reasonable request, I go ask.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am told \"I'm not getting out.\" and \"What does he do around here anyway?\"(I do almost all the cooking and cleaning in the house, so she isn't wrong, just in poor tact) Loudly and clear enough for my roommate to hear. At which point, I was appalled and leaned down and turned her head to me and made a face like \"Why are you doing this?\" Albeit I think I was a little forceful doing that, and I feel bad having done that to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I asked her if she could just sacrifice 10 minutes so he can shower for work, and she says \"I make sacrifices.\" My roommate hears what shes saying and leans into the bathroom, the shower curtain is closed so my girlfriend is not in view, and tries to get involved in the conversation, saying \"I'm a part of this conversation.\" And i say that's not really fair. And my roommate pipes up and says, \"Well we work, so how is this fair.\" And my girlfriend yells for us to get the fuck out of the bathroom so she can get out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe gets out, I leave for work quite quickly in the aftermath, already running late. This whole exchange occurred in a matter of 5-10 minutes of me waking up and I was not really within my faculties yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then she went to her mothers, and has the majority of the following phone conversation (read: her talking, me silent) with her family in the room. I have been called a \"little ass boy who cant let his pregnant girlfriend shower\" and been told \"I'll be surprised if blood isn't pouring out my vagina.\" And now she is saying that she would have gotten out of the shower in 5-10 minutes, and I should've been a man and told my roommate that she would be out in 5-10 minutes (which I would have if I had known that was an option). That I moved her head with force and hurt her, which I think I was forceful and should not have done. And that \"this makes me wanna pack all the shit I even have in that house.\" She is also very angry at me for letting my roommate step into the bathroom while she was naked (In the shower, curtain closed) which he barged in, and under all circumstances I would not put up with, it just all happened very quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also came to find out that my roommate didn't have to work as early as I did, after the fact, and this could have been much more avoidable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love her very much and she isn't herself when she acts this way, by the way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

You also shouldn't have been forceful towards her and moved her head the way you did.\n\nYour housemate, while part of the conversation shouldn't have entered the bathroom without permission, if he wanted to be involved he should have knocked and asked. Also, knowing your gf is pregnant, should have been a little more empathetic, unless she'd been in the shower for an extended period by that time (e.g. half an hour or longer), in which case his request wasn't unreasonable.\n\nPregnancy and nausea aside, your gf needs to remember she doesn't have the monopoly on the shower or live alone. She also should have, upon being asked if she could get out, specified she would be out in 5-10 minutes. Giving attitude towards a reasonable question/request, and verbally attacking you and your housemate is not on.",

It doesnt say how long he had been waiting already, he may also be an asshole in this situation if it was say, 5-10minutes before he barged in, but if he had been waiting 30 minutes or more I think its justified.",

It is up to the naked person whether this is a comfortable thing or not, and how was the shower curtain closed if OP had just turned her head towards him?\n\n\n\nIt also was not an urgent issue and yet the roommate pressed.  If you see OP's other comment about the GF being hospitalized for vomiting (something left out of the original write up), how is the roommate not more understanding?  There are many times when vomiting during pregnancy can be extremely severe and pregnant women have to be extremely careful moving and eating to make sure they keep food down. If you read OP's other comments it sounds like OP and GF are not on the greatest terms with the roommate (they are moving out soon). It sounds like roommate and GF have some issues, so roommate lacks empathy for a woman with severe morning sickness not wanting to move from the shower.  That makes the roommate the A.\n\nAlso, while the GF isn't working it is because her work wouldn't let her go to doctor's appointments (while pregnant), so it wasn't that she doesn't want to work (just in case someone is trying to make the \"she doesn't pay rent or work\" follow-up).  \n\nI'm not a fan of the GF's phone comments afterwards, but the roommate and OP are the bigger A's here in my view.",

(you did a small misstype btw in your comment, you switched op and gf genders.)\n\nSo, do you know about the word reputation? You go into work and your co-workers avoid you because you smell or look bad? That gives you a bad reputation. The roommate wanted to use the shower because he needed to look good on his job.\n\nThe roommate can and should be a bit more understanding, but also should she about living with others. You aren't entitled to the bathroom for hours at a time because you have morning sickness and pregnancy. I am not a female so I have no clue how a pregnancy works but biology wise she can take a 10 minute break from having water on her.\n\nI don't know where it's stated about the gf's work situation so I won't comment on it.\n\nEveryone imo is a butthole here, OP for forcibly moving his girlfriend's head, the roommate for not being a bit more considerate and understanding but GF is a butthole for the phone thing, and imo a bit for not considering the roommate too. \n\nSorry if this seems hazy or if my information has gaps and errors, it's late at night and I didn't expect a reply anymore.",

But you and the roommate did take away her privacy when she was vulnerable and that's unacceptable. And you grabbed her head forcefully??? Yeesh\n\nEdit: you should apologize dude. Yeah, it's rude to monopolize the shower. But come on. Don't grab someone's head like a belligerent child and deny them privacy (I don't care if the shower curtain blocked your roommates view, you should've closed and locked the god damn door). That's unacceptable.",
