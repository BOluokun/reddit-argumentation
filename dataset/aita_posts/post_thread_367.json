  "post content": "\n\nHello.\n\n\nI (f26) have been married to my husband (m31) for 3 years, and we're expecting a baby boy together.\n\nWhen I married my husband I kept my maiden name which he was perfectly okay with. We already discussed this and agreed that any future kids we have will automatically take his last name. His family considers this huge deal and I decided to keep to just go with it.\n\n\nBut recently I started thinking about it a lot more and figured that it would be unfair for my unborn son to take my husband's family name and not mine. I talked to my family and they said my husband and inlaws are ridiculous to push this on me without a compromise expecting I go with it. So I went home and told my husband that I've changed my mind about the last name thing and want to either have both our last names combined or my last name to be given to our son. He was confused saying we had an agreement and then asked what was the cause of this sudden change of mind. I told him and he said I can't just do that and called me selfish when I pointed out that I'm the mother I get a say too.\n\nWe went back n forth on this and he said no way he and his family will let me do this to his son, as if my last name is a disgrace. We had a fight and we stopped talking after this. He said that I broke and violated my part of the deal and I should just 'deal' with it now but I won't accept it.\n\n\nAITA?",

You confide in each other and work things out together and if you can't then get professional help if it's serious enough.  Adding family often creates a bias against your SO.  Family typically has no problem judging your SO for you.  Some family even uses your problems as ammunition to drive a wedge between you and your SO (speaking from experience) because they think you deserve better or even just don't like them.  It's really unfortunate to see so many people bring family in the middle of their marriage because it just seems too often that their problems worsen.  A parents job isn't to keep your SO safe/happy, it's to keep YOU happy so whatever is best for their baby (IN THEIR MIND) is what they'll do.  At least that's what I tend to see around more often than not.\n\nAnd YTA, OP.\n\nI respect you wanting to keep your name or anyone wanting to hyphenate, but you made a deal at marriage and the way you went about this was unfair.  By just deciding this, you're doing the exact same thing you accuse your husband of except that HE didn't agree to this change where as YOU did agree to a previous agreement.  Your husband most likely feels trapped, betrayed, and belittled by this and by his partner of all people.  Remember that you're a Team and meant to be supportive of each other and work together, not backstab and belittle.

The mother bears the child, breastfeeds the child, and is their primary caregiver (especially in the first few months) and bond immensely; thats just the way it is and has always been. It may seem silly but the last name is a way for fathers to bond with their children and feel pride and connection in a way that fathers can't really otherwise. I obviously bond with our daughter, and helped a lot and still do (our daughter is 11 months) but when our daughter is inconsolable or cranky or tired or sad, she wants her mom and I totally understand, and im glad my wife has that connection.

No one parent has more right to matters of heritage over another. It could certainly be argued that a mother should get extra say given the time, difficulties, and dangers of carrying a child to term, but I don't think that extends to this here.\n\nIt's also not some universal thing. Some agreements should have more room than others for a parent or partner to change their mind. Parenting and relationships are all about understanding when and how to compromise, when and how to advocate for yourself, and far more importantly how to communicate these things. I would never expect a partner to honor certain agreements if their minds change, especially when their bodies are involved. You want to stop shaving? You want to dye your hair? You want to bulk up or get plastic surgery or tats all over you or whatever? I'd like to talk about it, but ultimately it's your call 100%. Even if we talked about those things earlier.\n\nDecisions for a child that is equally ours, though? The previous arrangement carries more weight. The child is ours and decisions about how to parent them and what to call them should be equal and based in strong communication. \n\nI guess the ultimate answer for why you need cause to go back on a naming agreement is because that's not just a decision you're making for you. It's a decision you're making for me as well.",

She wants, she's decided.  They discussed it and came to an agreement.  Good.  She feels differently now.  Still good.  She's decided something different without having a conversation (ideally mature) with him, and while some people talk things out with family before going to their spouse, it comes off a bit definitive here.  \n\nSo I agree that he shouldn't be saying his family won't allow it, but it reads a little like she's saying the same thing about her family. I guess I'm saying it's fine that she's changed her mind, but I think her execution of it might be leaving something to be desired.

Mine have their dads\u2019 last names (may my first ex-husband Rest In Peace) and I kept my 2nd ex-husband\u2019s last name after our divorce because my youngest 3 kids wanted me to have their last name still. I kind of wish I had used my maiden name for one of my boys\u2019 middle names now though because I do love my maiden name. I don\u2019t know if that is something OP could do to incorporate their name in the baby\u2019s name while keeping their agreement with their husband.",

(I don't know what OP's husband's specific objections are, but I know many people are bothered by hyphenation because it makes the name too long, or maybe in this case it would be an issue because the child's last name wouldn't exactly match EITHER parent's.) This \"ultimatum\" makes no sense (and it isn't even phrased like a usual ultimatum--I would expect \"I want Option A, but I'll just do Option B if you refuse,\" not \"I want A or B\"), so I'm inclined to think that it wasn't actually presented as an ultimatum.",
