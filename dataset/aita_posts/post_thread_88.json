  "post content": "Ok\u2026I\u2019ve been dating my BF for about 9 months. The first few months his dogs stayed home with his roommate when he would stay over. Slowly he would have them with him and it would get late so they would stay over. I got them bowls and was trying to be tolerant, as I don\u2019t have dogs, nor do I allow my cats in the house. \n\nIt started to get more and more often and I started to not be ok with this. The dogs aren\u2019t trained. They\u2019re 2 BIG dogs and a little tiny one. 3 total. They have accidents over night, they eat food off the counter, they get in the trash, they are just seriously not trained in the slightest. I got to a point where I was losing my mind waking up in the morning stepping in pee or cleaning up poop and trash strung all over if we forgot to put it outside. I\u2019ve seasoned meat and had it all ready to cook and more than once they\u2019ve eaten the meat off the counter ( I\u2019m talking a plate of ribeyes, like $50 worth of meat). I\u2019m not used to having to worry about putting it up if I go outside for a few. \n\nI finally had to tell him I can\u2019t take it anymore. I don\u2019t want to feel anger or hatred towards animals as it\u2019s not their fault they\u2019re not trained. I just can\u2019t live like this. \n\nI will add that he lives like that. That\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t stay at his place. His bed is a dog bed. It\u2019s not suitable for humans. He\u2019s fine with dirty, torn up blankets and literal holes in his dirty mattress with springs exposed and foam everywhere from them tearing it up. He sleeps like that. No fucking way. I\u2019ve asked him to cut off his room to the rest of the house and make an acceptable place for us to sleep and I\u2019d be happy to stay with him. Nope, he\u2019s not willing to stop sleeping with them and giving them free reign to his room and bed. \n\nI told him they can\u2019t come to my house overnight anymore. I had to rip out the carpet and put in hardwood flooring to repair what they\u2019ve done at my place and make it acceptable to live in without it smelling like the pound when I walked in. He\u2019s super offended. He can\u2019t believe I\u2019m making him leave his dogs at home if he\u2019s staying at my place. This is nuts to me. \n\nHe and his parents think I\u2019m the devil and a dog hater for this. Are they right? I think I might be the asshole for not being more accommodating to the dogs, as I knew the situation when we started dating. AITA?\n\nEDIT\u2014since there have been many comments about being an asshole about having outdoor cats\u2026\n\nI live in the country. I have a small farm and I have 2 barn cats. They have access to a heated area and are very well taken care of. I love my kitties. They\u2019ve been fully vaccinated, both neutered and happy babes.",

Very basic training helps establish that you're the leader (not the alpha, that's not a real thing with dogs) and being able to trust their leader to keep them safe and guide them is what allows a dog's personality to blossom. Not only that, but if you continue to work with them regularly after basic puppy training, you build up communication between yourself and your dog and that's what gives you a truly strong bond, and beyond that, actual friendship. A friend once told me that it seemed like i and my boy had a psychic connection; it was just that we knew each other's mannerisms and body language so well that he'd just have to look at me for me to know what he wanted, and vice versa.\n\nI feel bad for those poor dogs, left to their own devices, having to figure out on their own how to exist in a world that's not built for them, with an owner who doesn't even try to help.

I generally dislike dogs, mainly because I regularly observe owners who let untrained dogs do whatever they want. For instance, yesterday I saw a golden retriever get clipped by a car because the owner let it run around off leash next to a busy road. I also saw a woman walking a dog on a crowded hiking trail while the dog went bananas, barking and lunging at people.\n\nI always admire the \\~10% of dog owners who seem to have it together: their dog is well trained, they actually keep it under control, they obey the rules.\n\nI think it takes work to be a good dog owner.

I don't say I hate dogs anymore though because so many people got ruffled and offended if I dared. Now I just say I'm not fond of them, but this shit is the reason why.\n\nWhen I can't leave my room without shoes on because the floors are slick with piss and I don't want to step in shit with my socks on, and I have to sleep with earplugs because my mom's dogs (now dog singular, thank god) have barked and cried and whined for almost six years every time she's left for work in the morning, *there is a fucking problem.* I hate living in such a disgusting environment, but since I was a child she's refused to do anything about her precious babies so until I can scrape together enough for a decent house I'm stuck living in literal shit.

              "content": "You are absolutely correct.\nHowever, this relationship is not going to last. My husband and I have been married around 33 years and he has always had dogs and they were well trained. He\u2019s kinda a dog whisperer. Two years ago we got a new dog, a dog I was absolutely against. We agreed on a medium size dog , one I could pick up to bathe by myself, as we are getting up there in years. The dog he insisted on getting is a freaking monster. She was getting food off of the counter top, she jumped up on the kitchen table, and she had accidents all the time. I said if she is in the house, she will be in a big dog cage with a tray in it. She had gas constantly and she would growl and bark every time I went near my husband. She broke out of her cage by biting the bars until she escaped, it took her all of 10 minutes to do that. We tried it again and my husband did his best to train her and it didn\u2019t work. I said that\u2019s it, she is now an outside dog. She still comes in the house to a new cage and the cage is on our big inside back porch. It has a wood stove and I don\u2019t have to deal with the mess and smells every night. We\u2019ve been trying to train her for over 2 years, and she will do what is asked of her to get a treat, but after 2 years she still keeps doing the same things that she knows is a big NO, if you just say her name she will stop for a minute and then turn around and do it again, over and over again. She is vicious to our son,DIL and grandkids. If the elderly lady next door, comes to talk over the fence, the dog will run as fast as she can and growls and barks at this little old lady who is as big as a 10 year old. The dog does this thing where she runs at top speed and plows into my knees and she has knocked me over so many times and it hurts so bad, then she starts spinning like a top and throws her entire body against you and I promise, you won\u2019t be standing after that. After one of her spinning things, she threw herself into my husband and then jumped on top of him and was moving nonstop. He ended up all bloody from her nails and teeth, she wouldn\u2019t get off of him, so I gritted my teeth and started growling at her, she jumped off and went and hid behind a bush. This is a common thing she does and I am fed up with her hurting us.  She has ruined more pieces of machinery by pulling wires off, pulling fuel lines and then she licks anything that smells like oil. She demolished our generator and it can\u2019t be fixed and we can\u2019t afford another one. I told my husband that it\u2019s me or the dog, and he started crying and begged me to let him keep her. I finally gave in, but I told him that he had to get a handle on her. I made him get a shock collar and it doesn\u2019t faze her.\nWe can\u2019t afford a dog trainer, so I am stuck with this monster. I told my husband that if anything ever happens to him, after I get home from whatever service there is, I will make sure that the dog joins him in eternity.\nThis dog should have gone to some big young guy with lots of energy. The day my husband insisted on this dog, is the day he made sure that this dog will be gone before it\u2019s time. I can\u2019t handle her, she hates everyone except my husband. Having an untrained dog in your life is miserable. A well trained dog is a part of the family. It was a sorry day that this dog came into our lives. \nIf you are not happy with his dogs, forget about a long term relationship. I wish you good luck",

You're *telling him* that the dog has physically hurt you and is emotionally destroying your happiness. The dog is *showing* your husband that it's not happy with it's life. And yet your husband is completely ignoring the proof right in front of him and is selfishly insisting on his own way. What a self-centered turd.\n\nCall your local animal shelter. Sometimes they have free or reduced priced trainers. Next, call the vet. If you can't physically get the dog to the vet, maybe a mobile vet (urban area) or large animal vet (rural area) can come to your house. They might be able to suggest anxiety meds for your dog (honestly, this dog is so under-exercised that she gets anxiety from the constant buildup of energy without proper release) or proper training techniques. What I think they'll recommend is rehoming the dog. There are facebook groups about dog behaviors and humane training, but make sure to find the legit ones.\n\nRehoming the dog might be your hill to die on. I mean, your hubby is literally showing you that he doesn't care about your health, your happiness, your comfort, or your property. He's choosing this dog (that he's not even treating well!) over you. This dog needs to go to a rescue because you don't deserve to be in an abusive relationship with an untrained animal and his enabler.",

It's not wrong to rehome a dog when you cant meet their needs however hard you try, so he's not only being selfish to you, he's also faililng whatever responsibility he feels he has to the dog (which is I assume why insists on keeping her).
