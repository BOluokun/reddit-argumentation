  "post content": "Still at the cottage and my wife isn't talking to me. It's not even our cottage, it's my parents' and we were supposed to be here to work on our marriage because we've been having issues. Not huge issues, but issues. Nobody's cheated or gambled all our money or anything. But she couldn't stop messaging her fucking \"writing friend.\" All they do is talk about their characters or roleplay them with each other. My wife is looking for a serious career in writing, and she is a great writer, but this is literally just for fun. She's never going to publish this gay dark academia borderline fanfiction she's writing, and she knows it (this isn't my opinion, she's said this). I mean I would still be pissed with her working while we're supposed to be spending time together, but this is worse. I told her I wanted her to focus on me and our relationship, and she said she would, she's just had a new stream of ideas she can't control. Which again, I could excuse if this was publishable stuff, but it's just her and her friend pretending to be two university students in love.\n\nBut I did something really shitty. I tried to initiate with her last night, and she rejected me, which is fine because it happens obviously, nobody's in the mood all the time, but then she just went right on her phone fucking roleplaying these guys. I grabbed her phone and threw it out the window. The phone is fine, she has a good case (which I knew, I wasn't trying to break it), but she called me a piece of shit and a ton of other things and isn't speaking to me today. I know no matter what I'm the asshole in all honesty, I'm just curious over whether this is an everybody sucks situation or not, and I have nothing else to do because she won't talk to me.",

          "content": "Well, arguable. I use to do a lot of RP writing with a few friends and wrote a LOT over time. More often than not it was romantic stuff because it was just more fun to write about as for us there were usually a lot more entertaining ideas surrounding that. It was a good outlet for me, I loved writing and the feeling of getting into someone else\u2019s headspace for a a bit. \n\nThat said, in my experience, though it by no means what so ever refers to everyone into RP, toxicity was common place. Especially in large communities. Eventually it got so bad that I ended up only ever writing with two at the time good friends because I trusted them to keep the drama low and to value our friendship over writing. I was wrong. These two had many other issues but it primarily had to do around RP and their expectations.\n\nAfter a bad break up I was in at a real low point in my mental state, and at first I dived right into RP hardcore just looking to escape my own headspace for as long as possible. When I started to get better and move on and started dating the man I\u2019m with now I had less time to write. These two were constantly guilt tripping me for not responding or contributing ideas, when I said I was trying to work on myself and not my characters that was not an acceptable answer. They manipulated me into thinking I was an AH for not using all my free time responding and said I was making their character\u2019s feel neglected. Keep in mind they didn\u2019t feel this way, it didn\u2019t matter how much I talked to them, their character\u2019s felt neglected because I wasn\u2019t writing enough for their needs. \n\nThere were many other problems between us, but this is what started it and what eventually lead to them deciding that I was \u201ctoo millennial\u201d and they didn\u2019t want to speak with me ever again. In the middle of the night after not talking for a while I got a message from the one I was closest to that was a long winded goodbye that made me feel like absolute sh!t for having my own life and trying to better myself. I cried for and hour because she was the closest friend I had ever had and I felt like my heart had been torn out. It took me a while and talking about it a lot in therapy to accept that they had very unrealistic expectations for me and I wasn\u2019t at fault. \n\nOP I won\u2019t deny that throwing the phone was an AH move but I understand your frustrations. if I were you I would ask if she\u2019s being pressured by the other party to respond and discuss as often as possible. If not maybe express that you understand this may be her outlet during an emotional time, but you\u2019d really appreciate if she could talk to you about it instead of throwing herself into someone else\u2019s headspace. I learned the hard way that though it may feel better in the moment, it doesn\u2019t help you heal in the long term.",

You tend to view them like an OC or a DND character and not \"me.\" There's a detachment there.

Probably in an attempt to deny to herself that this \\*is\\* an emotional affair, and she's scared of the implications of that. \n\nOr it's just -- it was the norm in the writing community she got into, and there may indeed be others in that community who do this kind of roleplay with each other but in which it is NOT an emotional affair.  It's not black or white, different people handle it differently, and compartmentalize in their minds differently.  So, coming from this community, it may be that she's telling herself and you that it \"can't\" be, because she sees that it is not with others.\n\nBut the problem is that the rest of her behavior is completely exhibiting the signs of an emotional affair.  It doesn't MATTER if they are OCs or \"them\" -- their OCs are their proxies, and they are investing emotion into this.  The point at which she can't tell her friend, \"sorry, gotta log off for the weekend for this trip; we'll pick this up when I get home!\" is the point at which she is emotionally dependent on this friend and this roleplay.  THAT is where the affair part comes in.\n\nESH is my ruling, for sure.  Y.T.A. for throwing the phone, of course, but you know that.  \n\nPlease do correct me if I'm wrong, though -- you made VERY clear to her that you and she were going to the cottage to work on your relationship?  Like, you didn't just couch it as \"let's go to the cottage, you liked that before, and we can spend some time together!\"  and then just expected she would get that what you meant was, work on the relationship, which is in trouble?  \n\nIf you were clear with her on that, then yeah, she is very much TA in this situation.  If you were not clear with her on it, but expected her to pick it up from you dancing around the subject, then she's a LITTLE less of an asshole, and you need to sit down with her and use YOUR words, and be clear. \n\nI do also want to say, you are kind of TA for being so dismissive of her writing, by saying that you would only understand it and be okay with it, if she was intending to publish.  It's still a valid pursuit, whether she publishes or not.  Her having writing and roleplay as a hobby isn't the issue.  The issue is that she does not seem to be able to put it down, and/or she will not put it down for you.  (Obviously, I don't mean, for sex.  As you said, sometimes one partner isn't in the mood, and that's okay.  But it sounds like she will not put it down for you at ALL, and that's not great.)\n\nUnfortunately, like a lot of other people here, it sounds like her actions are speaking loudly, and they're saying that she has checked out of this relationship.  I'm sorry about that, it sucks.  Again, though, before you give up completely, you should be very clear with her about what this weekend was about, and perhaps suggest couples therapy if she doesn't want to call it quits right then.",

It actually sounds to me like OP would be supportive if wife was planning on publishing AND not prioritizing this phone relationship with her \"friend\" over her actual relationship with her partner.\n\nThrowing the phone is definitely bad form. But holy shit, how frustrating and painful to be lead on and overtly dismissed by your spouse. Awful",

I think it's more common among writers who started out in the fanfiction world. The idea is sometimes just getting the words on the page, or into a text chat, because you can't edit what's still in your head. And it's pretty easy later to just cut and paste the RP into your file and start editing from there.

Roleplaying fiction is completely separate from sexting, the mere notion is ridiculous to me. It's an escapism mechanism, as many people that do it have mentioned in this thread. I would never entertain fucking the people I roleplay with, I don't have feelings for them, this isn't a weird by proxy thing. It's just collaborative writing. The problem isn't the wife's writing, it's the fact that she needs to escape in the midst of trying to fix their relationship. They need to communicate more.",
