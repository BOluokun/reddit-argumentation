  "post content": "Disclaimer: My mom was a single mother for most of my life and I in no way am implying there is something wrong with or shameful about being a single mother.\n\nI have this \u201cfriend\u201d Olivia. We aren\u2019t really close, but we belong to the same large social circle (so we have a lot of mutual friends). We were having a zoom \u201cparty\u201d when she announced she was pregnant with her boyfriend of one year. No one in our friendship group has met this boyfriend but we all gave her our congratulations and told her we\u2019d love to meet the father when lockdown ends. Olivia got a really coy smile on her face and told us we all knew him already, but she would officially introduce us when the pandemic was over.\n\nA few days later a smaller group of us were chatting and my friend \u201cEmma\u201d mentioned that another couple (Tom and Sarah) in our group were most likely going to get a divorce soon. This small group consisted of all of my personally close friends (which would normally include Sarah). Emma told us, with Sarah\u2019s permission, it turned out Tom was Olivia\u2019s baby\u2019s dad and when she made that comment during the zoom call it confirmed Sarah\u2019s suspicion and she snooped and found evidence. According to Emma, Olivia intentionally got pregnant (poked holes in the condom) and only announced it when she was no longer eligible for an abortion to force Tom to leave Sarah for her. Tom has told Sarah that he has no plans to be a dad to the baby no matter what happens between them.\n\nAt the next zoom party (neither Tom nor Sarah were present) Olivia broke down crying. She told everyone her boyfriend got cold feet about being a dad and broke up with her. That she would now be forced to be a single mother and that she needed her friends more than ever. Everyone was giving her sympathy (including the friends who knew the truth). She started making plans on how we would all \u201cchip in\u201d to help her get things for the baby before it arrived. This is when I started laughing. \n\nShe demanded to know what I found so funny and asked me if I was shaming her for being a single mother. We got in an argument which ended with me telling her she deserved to be a single mother and she made her bed so now she should lay in it. She started crying again and disconnected. \n\nSomeone else explained the whole Sarah/Tom/Olivia affair to everyone present who had no idea. Our friendship group is split. Half, whilst on Sarah\u2019s side, think we should still be sympathetic to Olivia too because she is going to be a single mom and would need us to be her support system (she has no family here and has a low income so will need financial help most likely). The other half think Olivia is a homewrecker and neither her nor Tom deserve any sympathy. Some people are now saying they will no longer attend events if Tom or Olivia are invited. Olivia\u2019s best friend called me a bitch for turning the group against her and said I was slut-shaming her, which I wasn\u2019t. \n\nAITA?",

My aside about Tom's \"responsibility\" was not towards Olivia, who sucks, but towards this poor kid, who pretty much all my sympathy is reserved for. In my mind, the \"responsibility\" I mentioned was taking responsibility for cheating, not for being the victim of reproductive coercion. I could have been clearer about that, my apologies.",

In this scenario, I had not consented to unprotected sex, so I would consider that to be sexual assault. Given that, I also consider poking holes in condoms to trick a guy into unprotected sex to be sexual assault. (I should note that stealthing hasn't been legally recognized as sexual assault in all jurisdictions. For example, I believe the UK is one that hadn't done so yet.)\n\nI'm all in favour of men having to pay child support for \"oops\" babies. Whether it's because they were careless and didn't take precautions, or because birth control failed, it doesn't matter. Unless society completely changes how children of single parents are supported and changes access to abortion/birth control, the men should be required to pay. But when the man didn't even consent to the sexual act, it was forced on him? It seems highly inappropriate to seek child support for the child conceived by him being sexually assaulted. \n\nHowever, I seriously hope Sarah dumps his ass. He's a major asshole for cheating.",
