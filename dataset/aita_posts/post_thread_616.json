  "post content": "So heres the thing I have autism. Life was kinda hard on me and when I was young I moved schools several times because it just wasn't right. The last school was verry small with only 8 others. (I came from classes with 30) 4 girls 3 boys and with me 5 girls. Even there were groups: The boys were 1 group and the girls ecxept for 1 with autism. When I saw that the girl with autism was left out I felt bad for her because I had the same multiple times but I wanted to fit in so I stayed away. The fitting in did'nt work for about a year and I decided to give it a chance with her. Just hanging out she was talking about autism alott so I thought she maybe did'nt felt comfortable around me or something so I told her I had autism to... That was a mistake. She talked about it even more and asked if I had the same it was pretty much everytime she was with me she talked about it so also when other people were around. A bit bad because I was okay with not really fitting in but was scared for being bullied because that was what happened on multiple schools when other found out. \n\nI was scared to say not to talk about it because I did'nt want to hurt her feelings or something but this one time we did a game: Find someone you have most in common with. The game did'nt even began en she screamed: I'LL GO WITH OP SINCE WE BOTH HAVE AUTISM.\nSo uhm I felt bad but I can't blame her on it since I did something like that you never know what to say and just say what you think. \n\nSince than everyone knew it and stayed away from me for at least 2 months but luckily everyone forgot a bit by than and talked to me again. I'm and introvert but still a human so I did'nt like it that everyone stayed at least 2 feet away from me like I had some kind of disease. I was glad people talked to me still being a bit like: \"Uhm yeah I do want to get out of here asap.\" But still\n\nI was scared it would happen again so when the girl asked me to hang out I said no and explained why. She seemed angry and sad at the same time.\n\nIt happened in elementry school it's a long time ago but I just keep thinking about if i was an a hole.\n\nHelp",

No you didn't do the \"right\" thing (if it exists in that situation, it's hard to tell, you were very mature by communicating) but that doesn't make you an AH, it makes you young.\n\nThe good news is that you still feel remorse (otherwise you wouldn't have made this post) and are committed to being a better person, NAH.",
