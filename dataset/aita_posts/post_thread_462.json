  "post content": "I started a small business with 3 other software engineers 10 years ago and now we\u2019ve grown into a 50+ employee company. Our old accountant quit because she was unhappy about not getting the raise she wanted and on her way out leaked everyone\u2019s salaries through an email. We have about 30 SWEs and the rest are QAs and employees who handle the business/sales sides of things. All our devs are payed like 2x-4x times everyone else\u2019s salaries which I think is pretty par for the course. Our lowest paid employee still makes 50k which is above average for their role in our area - we\u2019re Midwestern based. \n\nThe leaked email has created a tense and awkward atmosphere at the workplace. Some employees have expressed concerns over the wage discrepancies during our one-on-ones. I\u2019ve maintained that nothing is going to change since the email leak and I am looking into legal action against our ex employee who leaked it but am wondering if I\u2019m the a\u2019hole here. Like I said I pay above average for everyone\u2019s roles based on our CoL and we are a tech based company, so our SWEs are our money makers.",

The employees need some attention. If they continue to beef about differing pay rates for different skill sets you can encourage them to become devs., offer to pay for classes maybe? Flex schedules so they can attend school P.T.? But let them know you are taking this opportunity to upgrade and professionalize HR with a goal of having salary surveys complete by Q2?
