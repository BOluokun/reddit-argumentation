Both living in North America and have known each other for fifteen years.  \nI wrote an article on how I been trying to stay active during COVID. I sent him the link. I sent the link to few other friends too. Just link. Nothing else. He responded \u201clame\u201d.  \nI said, \u201cway to support your friend\u201d. He said something on the lines of \u201cfriend is the one that is honest with you\u201d.  \nI responded \u201cgo fuck yourself\u201d.  \n**I am now left wondering if I acted or reacted disproportionately? <-- This is the action I need you to assess and tell me if I was being an a\\*\\*hole for saying this?**   \nIf it were a random article written by a stranger, that response might be okay. But he knew that I wrote that. If he didn\u2019t find it great writing, he could have shared feedback instead of being so cold. Or if the topic was not of his interest, he could have said that.  \nIronically , he was severely offended by my words in the above exchange. There was period of silence for several weeks after this.  \nPS: *mention of nationality was important to provide cultural context because some people tell me that I have become too white or snowflake for taking offense on such little things .*",

I've gotten into digital art as a hobby a few years ago and made a lot of friends who are veteran and beginner digital artists, and there's a lot of variance in between who can and can't handle certain criticisms. Some people respond well to criticism, others get very temperamental even if you give constructive criticism. Some people want to improve and want educated criticisms and get upset with hearing \"that looks cool\" from the same person over and over, some are kind of shy and sulk if you aren't as enthusiastic about their work as much as they are. My 2 friends who got me into digital art are polar opposites and one prefers brutally honest criticism so she doesn't even ask close friends for opinions because she assumes all of them will just coddle her no matter what she draws, and the other prefers only showing art to her friends because she's quite shy about posting and being judged publicly.",

And I think that's probably true of most forms of art. I don't know that I want to speak for everyone, but I suspect that's what most artists set out to do. They have a thought or an image or a feeling or a story they want to share with the world.\n\nBut how you felt doesn't have to be in technical terms. For writing, it's simple. Did you feel sad? Did you feel happy? Did you feel anxious? Were you excited to keep turning the page? Did some event in the story affect you deeply? For music, did it make you want to dance? Drive really fast? Did you feel like you had to keep listening to it over and over? You could look at a painting and feel awe, pain, a sense of beauty, whatever.\n\nFor me this serves a couple purposes. If they feel what I wanted them to feel, sure, it feels good. It means on some level I succeeded. If they feel something different I didn't intend or have a reaction I didn't expect, that gives me the chance to be reflective about it. Do I like that someone felt that way? Do I need to change something, or alter what I'm doing in the future to try to avoid producing that feeling? Is it an added bonus to what I intended? Is it getting in the way of what I intended? Etc.\n\nDon't be so hard on yourself just because you're not an expert in something. Sure, maybe you don't know enough to critique someone's brush work, but I doubt that's what they're after when they ask what you think. If someone asks you what you think of something they made, they're probably sharing something that is personal and meaningful to them, and they just want to gauge how you experienced it.",
