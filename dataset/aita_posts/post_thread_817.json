  "post content": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. \n\nI (41M) and my friend Dave (34M - not real name) both play fiddle in an Appalachian folk band (don't ask.) Recently after a few post-gig beers we got into a heated debate about my favourite band, The Mountain Goats. Dave considers nearly all non-classical /jazz /folk/fusion music to be trash. I was arguing that while their early work is pretty straightforward and doesn't take much skill to play, in recent years the music has become relatively harmonically complex, with lots of jazzy, extended piano chords and use of controlled dissonance to compliment the lyrics, and that he'd probably like it if he gave it a chance. He kept saying they write storybook music for children, which annoyed me. \n\nThis was maybe a little petty of me, but eventually I snapped and suggested that if you compared TMG to someone like Phillip Glass, who is a worthy 'artist' but a simplistic musician, you might even say that John Danielle is the more talented performer, and that Dave was buying into a lot of corporate classical elitism that the labels encourage to hike up prices. \n\nDave lost it, questioned my judgement and said I wasn't even a good violin player, which, as I've decided nearly all my spare time and money to my musical hobbies for over twenty years, irked me. There's a code of conduct among musicians and he broke it, insulting a band mate's skill is a line you don't cross. I stormed off and drove home angry, he tried to call me up to apologise but I haven't returned his calls yet. I'm supposed to be attending his son's christening next weekend but I'm still mad so I've decided gonna stay home and listen to Tallahassee instead. \n\nMy wife thinks I should be the bigger man, but I'm still too upset with him. AITA? \n\nTl;dr - my friend is also a folk violin player and insulted my violin abilities because I told him The Mountain Goats are more harmonically inventive than Philip Glass",
