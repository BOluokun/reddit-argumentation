  "post content": "Yesterday I went to McDonald\u2019s and they told me it\u2019d be 5 mins until my food was ready. They told me to park in the unoccupied handicapped spot. There were no other empty spots that were close. I told the cashier that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable parking there and she insisted I did. I stopped arguing and did it. I didn\u2019t want to hold up the line more than I was. Well that 5 mins turns into 10 mins. I noticed that a car passed me with a very rude look in their eyes... then I notice the handicapped hanger in their car. I felt God awful. I told the McDonald\u2019s employee with my food and she basically said that sucks and walked away. \n\nShould I have insisted I park somewhere else? Idk. I just feel like an asshole. Was I?\n\nEdit: Since people keep mentioning this they had 3 parking places to wait for your food in the drive thru. They were all taken. The spot where you could pull forward to wait in the drive thru was full too.",
