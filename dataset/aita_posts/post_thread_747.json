  "post content": "I know it seems like I suck.\n \nYesterday, I asked my fianc\u00e9e what her Mac password was. She had some financial documents there. She took the laptop, typed the password, and gave it back to me. I got slightly pissed. I shared my passwords with her; why doesn\u2019t she do that to me?\n \nSo, I went to my computer, which she probably uses more than me, and I changed the password. The next time I used it, I asked her to go outside the room so I can type the password. Then she got mad. I told her that\u2019s how I felt when she did the same thing. She told me it\u2019s different because that\u2019s her laptop but this is our computer. Which it is not. I bought it before we were together, and I regularly upgrade it.\n \nSo, AITA?",

Keeping a password secret is normal, expected behavior. Deliberate passive-aggressiveness is not normal, expected behavior. Because we don't know why your wife is keeping her password to herself (because you didn't ask her) we can't assume that she's TA, because by default keeping your password to yourself is normal.
