  "post content": "UPDATE:\nThe wedding was on Oct 9th and it was beyond amazing and everything my wife and I hoped for. After the honeymoon, I started reaching out to close friend again to see if we could talk. I found out quickly I was still blocked on social media, and my number was blocked as well. I spoke to a few mutual friends for help and after contacting him, they were told he wants nothing to do with me. Just last week, I sent him 2 shirts he ordered from my website along with a handwritten note explaining if he ever wanted to get in contact with me, my number is still always open and I have and won\u2019t block him just in case. This was delivered last Tuesday, 11/30, with no reply or reach out. My mutual friends who helped me previously are now shadowbanned and blocked as well. Not really the update I was hoping to post but that\u2019s life. Thanks to everyone for their input and ideas and suggestions.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I get married this upcoming October. When I proposed last September, we had picked a really close friend of ours, who I thought of as my brother, to ordain us. He has a history of public/motivational speaking, plus he\u2019s seen our relationship grow from the early stages till now (~6 years). It was a no brainer for us. Cut to this past Saturday, we\u2019re talking about the wedding in our group chat and he mentions he will be taking a micro dose of Acid to \u201cget his head in the right mind space\u201d before the ceremony. I subtly said that my fianc\u00e9 and I didn\u2019t think that would be the best decision. He rebuttals with the statement that he has crippling social anxiety and won\u2019t be able to do the ceremony and talk to our guests unless under the influence of something. Again I state that we would respectfully ask him to refrain from doing anything before the ceremony. I told him after the ceremony, he\u2019s free to do whatever he wants. He continues to make excuses on why he needs it. I essentially tell him to suck it up or if it\u2019s too much we can find another officiant no sweat no fuss. He then blocks me on everything and sends a text stating he can\u2019t associate with people who twists his intentions and good luck in life. He blocked my number so I couldn\u2019t even respond or call. AITA for wanting our ordainer and best friend to be sober during our big moment?",

If he\u2019s a really close friend I\u2019m surprised you wouldn\u2019t know about either his microdosing OR social anxiety before asking him to do this. I simply can\u2019t personally imagine ANY of my friends asking me to officiate a wedding without expecting I would smoke weed beforehand. \n\nAt the end of the day this is your wedding and you\u2019re allowed to require whatever you want from folks attending, but I can also taste the judgmental vibes from here. I get why he went nuclear block option, but he\u2019s also definitely an AH for that. Dude is suppose to be one of your best friends so maybe take a breath and try to have a conversation with him about why he finds it so helpful and what the results tend to be and how that could affect the wedding.",

He\u2019s had more than a few bad trips when we\u2019ve taken shrooms or acid together. He\u2019s only recently been taking acid daily for the past 3 weeks.

Microdosing is taking a very small amount, not enough to actually affect you the way taking a whole dose would, but enough to help with creative thinking, mental disorders, etc. \n\nIt's your wedding, so you do what feels best, but I don't think anyone is the asshole here.",
