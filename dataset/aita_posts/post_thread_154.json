  "post content": "I(24m) was a family function with quite a few family members for religious reasons. Now my uncle is very religious and thinks he's the most important one in the room. He pushes his personal views on everyone, and he has a bad habit of doing this at the dinner table.\n\nMy little brother(16) is a very quiet and serious person and doesn't really like to involve himself with my uncle(niether do i). As soon as dinner starts, my uncle starts going off at my brother for dating and not being religious. My brother doesn't really care and ignores him usually, and i do too.\n\n(FYI, my uncle loves tea and would force us to make it for him when we were kids). Eventually my uncle says \"you are going to burn in hell with that sl*t\" and my brother broke his silence and responded with \"well if I do go to hell I'll be sure to bring you a cup of tea\". As soon as he said this, I cough out my food and started laughing uncontrollably. \n\nBut things escalated quickly as my uncle got really offended and started shouting, and his son started threatening my brother. So I defended my brother and basically said both my uncle and his son can go f themselves.\n\nMy brother and I left soon after without finishing the food. My cousins left angry messages calling us a-holes and nasty things.  I just thought it was a funny joke and defended my brother from getting ganged on, so am I or my brother really the a-hole here?\n\n\n\n\n",
