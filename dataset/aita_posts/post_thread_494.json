  "post content": "To provide some background, I am a petite female working as a language lector. I only teach people individually and try for my lessons to be fun. Each lesson is just me and the student (max 4) in my classroom for an  hour, which seems to work for everyone, and the results are  pretty good, but it is also the reason why I try to pick my clients  carefully - feeling a bit vulnerable all alone with them.\n\nSo  about half a year ago a lady contacted me about lessons for her two small kids (girls 7-9yo). At first everything was normal and fine, the kids were sweet and excited to learn. Until one of the girls started saying creepy stuff. She would draw a house and explain that \"there lives a cannibal who eats kids\" and go on in detail explaining how the man chopped somebody up and which part he is eating/cooking/grilling.\n\nThe first time, I was shocked and told her mum, but the mum just shook it off, but it keeps happening. As the lessons went, I found out that the kid's favorite movies  are gruesome horror movies, which she is capable to find online on her  own, and which she states \"are not scary to watch, they are so funny!\"\n\nProbably  the last drop was when we were playing with dolls, and this girl  arranged them all to lie on the floor of the dollhouse with one standing  in the middle and made me and her sister guess what has happened, we  tried \"she is reading a story to them\", \"they are playing a game\", etc.  nope! IN the end, she exclaimed excitedly \"NO! SHe has poisoned them All  because they were annoying!\"\n\nSince then  I have to explicitly ban murder/killing from every single game because her sister, who was originally visibly scared of it, started getting in on the \"fun\", and I am starting to feel that I have to cut my connection to this family ASAP.\n\nI am already creeped out by that kid, and cannot imagine spending time with her alone when she grows bigger. I  have already heard about her \"digging a hole to bury a classmate in,  because they are naughty\", and her own mother commented \"I am just waiting for somebody to disappear\" in a half-joking half-serious manner.\n\nSo,  AITA? Is this a normal kid behavior which will pass? Am I  overreacting? Am I a scaredy-cat? Or do I rightfully feel in potential danger? I have no idea how to break it to their mom, who is a very sweet person...\n\nEdit: I should probably add, that another thing which makes me back out is that I have seen the kid physically attack her mother a few times it pretty normal situations. The reaction was totally unexpected, 0 to 100 in a second. I don't want to get in such situation, because it could only end in trouble...\n\nEdit 2: I feel I need to defend myself here - I have NEVER scolded, criticised or shunned the kid, or any other. I have never given her a reason to feel bad, and would never do that. I treat all children as individuals and with respect, it is the reason why we have such good relationships. When I ban murder from the games, the kid laughs, because she takes it as an inside joke, not being criticised.",

Consider however this is a little kid that probably just mimics things she watches online and is being creepy without realizing it. Small kids have no concept of social inhibition and I don't believe there is intentional evil in her behavior. As an educator, it is important for you to think also that if this kid keeps being segregated for its behavior and considered \"creepy\" even by adults then the situation will worsen, I believe you should have another, very open and honest conversation with the parents, sharing your thoughts, maybe suggesting they should not allow a little kid to uncontrollably surf the net. You can be a good influence for this child, you are however completely justified not to want to take up that role.",

But... it's possible the kids are not creepy serial killers in the making, they're just feeding off of and reacting to your actions.  In your first paragraph you state that you feel vulnerable simply being alone with students, so you're already on edge.  No idea how the cannibal thing first came up, but your reaction must have been severe enough to prompt the sister, who you state was originally scared by the comments, to join in with the comments.  \n\nIOW, it's possible your reactions and fear are - if not causing - at least contributing substantially to this.  This insight may not help for the current situation, but might help you avoid creating future problems with students.",

To clarify, I normally feel very comfortable being alone with my students, my classroom is my favourite place to be TBH, I might have stated that misleadingly.

I might try just ignoring it, but when I do that, her sister and her start aggravating it really really bad. She seems to be doing the same at her school and other courses, so it is not only me.",

      "content": "NAH, but you should like...really definitely try to talk to the mom about early warning signs for violent tendencies and low empathy, because that's the alarm bells that your descriptions are setting off. Some kids are just imaginative, but some are actually potentially dangerous and will learn to hide their socially unacceptable behavior and thoughts as they get older. It might be good to make a list of child psychologists who are able to deal with this sort of behavior and *strongly recommend* to her that she take her daughter(s) to work with them regularly. The mom sounds nice, but also sounds like the type of person to get walked all over rather than making sure her daughter understands that the things she's doing in her pretend play are *wrong*.\n\nBest case scenario even if the mom does seek therapy and help: the girl does grow out of it, or only needs a little extra intervention. Worst case scenario: she actually very desperately needs early intervention to develop cognitive morality or anything resembling empathy. This is not the kind of thing that her mother should gamble on.\n\nYou're definitely in the right for being reluctant to work with them. She sounds like exactly the type of kid who would turn the situation against you if she attacked you, e.g. injure herself and then claim you did it because she knows it's your word against hers and hers will probably take priority. That's an extremely dangerous situation to be in, and her sister is likely to be scared of her and back her up. *If* you want to continue working with them for a while before making a decision, it would be wise to change to a public venue, like a library, somewhere that there are witnesses around. You could also make it an ultimatum or tell the mom that you'll work with them again when she starts seeing a therapist regularly + progress has been made.\n\nSome resources:\n\n[An article about callous children](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/when-your-child-is-a-psychopath/524502/) \\-- the examples here may be rather extreme comparatively\n\n[Searchable listings of psychologists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) \\-- even if you can't find one who specializes in low empathy kids, any local therapist might be able to point you/the girl's mom toward more extensive resources\n\n[Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits](http://labs.uno.edu/developmental-psychopathology/ICU.html) \\-- this page is intended for researchers, but you, the mother, and the child filling out your respective versions of this to give to a therapist may prove helpful for diagnostic/therapy purposes",
