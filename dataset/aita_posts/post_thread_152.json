  "post content": "6 of us (me, bf, 4 other friends) are renting out a unit together so we can be closer to all the good summer jobs in a touristy town. The property has a TV that isn\u2019t a smart TV and only works if something is connected to the HDMI cable. \n\nWe have been using my laptop to watch movies/youtube/shows together this way all week. I just started training at my summer job and they are demanding to know my laptop password so they can keep watching movies while I\u2019m at work. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to explain that I have VERY personal things on my laptop, discord and messenger autostart and have notifications and I\u2019m logged into all my accounts on my browser. They\u2019re EXTREMELY offended by this and say that I don\u2019t trust them and think they will snoop or go through my stuff or read my messages. \n\nI DONT think they would INTENTIONALLY snoop, I just don\u2019t want them ACCIDENTALLY seeing anything personal without me in the room. \n\nNow everyone is mad at me because they can\u2019t use the TV if I\u2019m at work, I\u2019ve told them to just get a chromecast or something and they\u2019re acting like now they HAVE TO buy it since I\u2019m an a-hole and don\u2019t trust them. AITA?\n\nEdit: I couldn\u2019t decide between \u201cnot wanting to share my laptop with\u201d and \u201cnot wanting them to use my laptop\u201d and messed up the title, my bad.",
