  "post content": "I (40f) was a single mother to my daughter, Amy (15f). I came out 3 years ago and married my wife Jenna (42f) last year. She has a daughter, Nora (13f). We all live together as I have full custody of my daughter. It was kind of hard for her to adjust to having a second mom, but they got along well.\n\nThe girls have their birthdays very close, only two days apart, so we decided to have a joint birthday party for both of them, since Nora had a hard time making new friends (they moved in with us and she's very shy). Most of my family lives out of the country, so the gifts were sent a week early. It was a huge bag, with at least 20 gifts. The party was nice and we opened the bag at night once everyone left.\n\nJenna handed out the presents as she took them out. After 12 gifts in a row just for Amy, I checked the bag and froze to see that there was only one gift for Nora, from my parents. She pretended it wasn't a big deal, but as she opened the present I saw her eyes drop. It was a $15 tumbler from Walmart. Not to sound ungrateful, but Amy's gifts were much more expensive (lots of gift cards over $100, a new phone, limited-edition Funkos, designer clothes and lots of cards wishing her a happy birthday).\n\nNeedless to say, I blew up the family chat, calling out my parents, siblings, and extended family who sent gifts for not considering Nora and my parents for the cheap gift. No one took me seriously since: *\"It's not our duty to give gifts to someone else's kid\"* and *\"Amy deserved them, since I didn't even throw her her own birthday party\",* emphasizing that Jenna and Nora are my problem, not theirs.\n\nNora was clearly hurt, since it's not the first time my family has left her out. At night, I asked Amy to share some of the gifts with her stepsister. Not all of them, just a couple of gift cards and some of the new clothes. Amy refused. This surprised me, since she never had a problem with sharing and even though she and Nora are not BFF's, they usually get along. After asking why, Amy started crying, saying that she never wanted a joint birthday party, and that I force her to share everything with Nora. They share a room for space and I make sure they're both invited to the same parties and sleepovers, so that Nora won't be left out. If they don't invite both of them, then either of them goes.\n\nAmy stated that she at least wanted her own gifts to be hers alone. I scolded her for being selfish with her stepsister, grounded her and took a couple of the presents to give to Nora. She turned them down because she didn't want problems with Amy and it felt like pity. Since then, Amy has been cold to all of us. I just wanted my two girls to be closer with the joint party and have the same things. AITA?\n\nClarification: Jenna and I bought gifts for the girls (their own tablets), as well as their friends. Nora also received gifts from her extended family, but they sent for Amy as well.",

Her room, her stuff, her family, her friends, her birthday party, the parties she goes to, sleepovers.... is there anything really HERS? This can't be good for her development.

Initially,  we liked each other a lot, she was 16, we had a similar temperament,  & similar compatible personalities.  Sharing a room was fine, we were both mildly messy,  & respectful of each other's stuff,  & space. \n\nAt first,  I introduced her to my friends,  & things were going great.  Then my parents decided that if I was going out,  she had to go out with me,  otherwise I had to stay home. She didn't always want to come with tho, if it was a concert,  or a party,  or the beach, she was game,  but we also had quiet nights of just hanging out at someone's house,  or playing games, & those had no appeal to her. Then she made friends at her school (I was in uni, as I graduated early), & wanted to go out with them,  but she wasn't allowed if I didn't go with her. They liked shopping,  going to the mall to just hang,  things that had absolutely no appeal to me.  We still went with each other,  & invited our own friends,  but it was obvious the other one wasn't enjoying it. \n\nIt started to chafe at our tentative friendship,  & made cohabitation difficult. Until we decided to play the system.  We'd leave the house together,  I'd drop her off to do her thing,  & I'd go do my own thing,  then pick her up before curfew so we could arrive home at the same time. Things improved after that,  & when she went home,  we were on friendlier terms, but eventually lost contact completely.  \n\nI can't help but think that if my parents hadn't been so invasive,  & pushy,  we might've never fell out with each other.  At least now,  I can laugh at how ridiculous our arguments must've sounded,  her ranting in German (which I had intermediate knowledge of), & me ranting back in Spanish (similar level as my German), all our plotting was done in English tho, lol.",

Not all of them, just a couple of gift cards and some of the new clothes. Amy refused. This surprised me, since she never had a problem with sharing and even though she and Nora are not BFF's, - youre forcing them to share, when they arent even close. she doesnt argue to keep the peace\n\n> Amy started crying, saying that she never wanted a joint birthday party, and that I force her to share everything with Nora. They share a room for space and I make sure they're both invited to the same parties and sleepovers, so that Nora won't be left out. If they don't invite both of them, then either of them goes. - LISTEN TO YOUR KIDS! they need their own shit, and their own space. ffs jeez. \n\n>Amy stated that she at least wanted her own gifts to be hers alone. I scolded her for being selfish with her stepsister, grounded her and took a couple of the presents to give to Nora. She turned them down because she didn't want problems with Amy and it felt like pity. Since then, Amy has been cold to all of us. I just wanted my two girls to be closer with the joint party and have the same things.

She doesn't get her own birthday, now she can't even have her own gifts because you feel bad? **SO YOU FORCEFULLY TAKE THEM ANYWAY** and are somehow surprised your daughter is \"cold\" towards you.\n\nYou say you want them to get along but all of your actions will make your daughter hate Nora because you give her what Amy will perceive as special treatment. You're on the fast track to your daughter moving out as soon as she can and never coming back to visit, so if you don't want that for your future then you best fix your mistakes here.",

If your stepdaughter is unable to make friends, try to get her to be more outgoing, not hijacking on someone else's invites to sleepovers. Do you know what happens when someone is forced to take their sibling every where? People stop inviting them because they can't enjoy anything or say their inside jokes because someone else will be there. Go out to the neighborhood and invite people for your step daughter's birthday, stop making it your daughter's responsibility. It isn't upto her to provide your stepdaughter with friends. Even if it was her own sister, she had no obligation. And if there is another room, give her another room. Stop suffocating the child. You're the reason your family hasn't warmed upto your stepdaughter. Because you're treating the child they love badly. You can just randomly demand they provide gifts for a girl they don't know. But after some time they would have warmed up if you weren't using your own kid as a scapegoat for being popular and social.",

From being the only child and living with her mom (getting all your attention) to living with two strangers and having to adjust to a new family dynamic (and therefore, less of your attention). She now has to share a room with a stranger, have this stranger invited to all activities she goes to, and if Nora isn't invited then neither of them can go (?!). Her entire sense of individualism is being stripped of her. \n\nYou should've asked the girls (separately) before hand if they wanted a joint party, and not to mention, you should've just looked in the bag ahead of time to see the gifts (or taken some of your own money and bought Nora her own gifts!!!!). YTA for asking her to share the only things she has to herself. If you really felt that bad for Nora, you and Jenna could've bought her her own gifts with your own money. Remember, this is new for your side of the family too, and since you mention most of them live out of the country, I'm assuming most of them haven't even met Nora and don't know her that well, so why would they spend hundreds of dollars on a child they don't know? \n\nPlease apologize to your daughter and let her live her life independently of Nora.
