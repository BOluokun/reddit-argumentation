  "post content": "\n\n\nMy late wife and I invested in a small winter cabin years ago. I'm the owner now after her passing. My son (22) is getting married to his STBW in a month. They have no money for a destination honeymoon, they were barely able to plan the wedding. He asked if they could spend their honeymoon in my winter cabin and I agreed but under the condition that they pay me. He acted all shocked and tried to argue that it's his mom's cabin too but I pointed out how I'm the owner now and that I pay to keep it maintained. He got upset and accused me of being materialistic and selfish after I'd already been unhelpful with the wedding. I told him I did the same thing with his aunt and it wasn't personal. He left with his fiancee and told the family about it.\n\n\nNow I'm being berating left and right and am being told to let him use the cabin and shamed me for asking for money.\n\n\nINFO: I already told him a millionth times that getting married so soon was not a good idea but he refused to take my advice and had no regard for my opinion on the situation.",

But now as well as me disapproving of your fiancee and choices, you get to pay the ultimate Air BnB add on fee. Dead mom tax. Because I hate you, I hate your fiancee and remember your mother is dead and missing the wedding and the milestones of your life I don\u2019t give a shit about. Oh and cleaning fee is not included for crying on the bed linen.\u2019\n\n\nLike you can see his son basically asking \u2018but dad, what would mom think?\u2019 to try to appeal to OP over a marriage and honeymoon but OP is as cold as an unheated cabin in December emotionally.\n\nThe \u2018I\u2019m the sole owner now\u2019 was icy AF. Yeah dude you own the whole cabin because you were widowed and your son lost his mom. Talking like it updated your portfolio suggests OP does not do warm fuzzies unless sales tax is added. He reminds me a bit of my dad who was still complaining last time I spoke to him that he had had to buy bottled water at a tourist price on vacation because I as a chronically ill child collapsed and the water was twice the price as the supermarket. He had been griping about this \u2018rip off\u2019 I inflicted for 30 years when I noped out of contact. That was shortly after he married his third wife for tax purposes and her mileage allowance and literally mentioned both in the vows but not in an in joke fashion.",

Like ok give me a fucking check for $97k then? But it\u2019s all about being for show.",
