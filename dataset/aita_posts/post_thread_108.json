  "post content": "So, to start, I have 50/50 custody of my daughter Claire (12f) with my ex-wife Jessica. Jessica is married to Chris (40m), who has two kids; Addie (7f) and Luke (10m). Claire spends one week at my place, one week with her mom. Sunday is the \u2018swap day\u2019. \n\nTwo weeks ago, Claire had a huge fight with her stepsiblings. Apparently they snuck into her room when she was away and went through her stuff, breaking some of her important items in the process, and Claire screamed at them when she found out. Jessica and Chris wrote off Addie and Luke\u2019s behavior as \u201ckids will be kids\u201d (I disagree, I think that Addie and Luke need a reality check for their behavior and that they shouldn\u2019t get away with it). However, they said that Claire\u2019s reaction was \u201cover the top\u201d and \u201ca sign that there\u2019s something wrong with her\u201d. \n\nJessica decided that she needed to \u201cfind out what\u2019s in Claire\u2019s head\u201d and so she confiscated Claire\u2019s sketchbook (which Claire uses to get her feelings out) and went through it. Apparently, what she found was \u201cdisturbing\u201d (Claire has showed me her sketchbook before and no it isn\u2019t) and took Claire to a psychologist for evaluation. \n\nSpoiler alert: they didn\u2019t find anything. My daughter is completely mentally healthy, save for (surprise surprise) stress from her step-siblings. \n\nAnyway, I got Claire last Sunday, and she spent her first few hours with me holed up in her room (sketching I think). At dinner, she told me what happened, and I surprised her with pancake breakfast the next morning to make her feel better. \n\nBefore I gave her back to Jessica, Claire asked me to keep her sketchbook at my house so her mom wouldn\u2019t look through it. I said yes, and she went over to her mom\u2019s place without it. \n\nYesterday, I got a text from Jessica. She said that she was \u201cworried that Claire forgot her sketchbook\u201d because when she went to confiscate it, it wasn\u2019t where Claire usually keeps it. She then asked me to arrange a time and place for her to pick it up. I said that the sketchbook was with me, and that I decided to keep it because I didn\u2019t want it confiscated again (I didn\u2019t want to throw Claire under the bus here, in hindsight lying probably wasn\u2019t the best idea). She said that I was being an AH because she \u201chas a right to her daughter\u2019s mind\u201d. I said that i was worried because of how she handled it last time she went through it. She restated her previous point, and I did not respond. \n\nIt\u2019s been about a day since that conversation, and I\u2019m starting to question my choice. AITA?",

OP, document **everything**. *Everything.* Their response to your daughter's very normal behavior and sibling stress is disturbing and suggests she's being scapegoated in that home. (especially as they are excusing their other children's behavior as 'normal', which means that they are excusing other harmful behaviors too. Where will it end?)  \n\n\nI would encourage you to consult a lawyer and petition for full custody. You don't want to let this abuse continue. Making your daughter out to be the villian in all of this and this 'right to her mind' nonsense is screaming 'mental health issues' with your ex -- I grew up in a house like this and wish someone had rescued me from this blame and erratic adult behavior. Your daughter needs you to step up for her now-- be the parent she is needing.",

You knocked on anyone else's before entering, etc. My parents didn't go through our shit. \n\nIf there had been a reason to, they 100% would have. I mean that in like, all the sudden our grades went from A's to F's, we started completely withdrawing, wearing long sleeves/pants even in the middle of summer, significantly dropping weight with no explanation....things like that. My brother got really fit during junior year of high school but he was working with our schools nutritionist and kinesiology teacher (who personally trained his kids who went to the olympics), so him getting fit, made perfect sense.\n\nDoing something like going emo, they would have been like, \"Meh, that's fine, let them dress how they want.\" They were always around, though. They gave us privacy, but they were involved parents. They knew their kids, so they were well attuned to us. Dinner time was my dad standing at the bottom of the stairs and yelling \"DINNER,\" and 6 doors would open and close. \n\nWe also went to them with our problems bc they didn't get mad, so that knocked out 99% of their worries about us needing privacy bc us having a problem wasn't an issue. We just wanted some things kept private. \n\nBoth my parents have certain things we have never been allowed to go into, for the same reason, and we never have. None of us wanna know what my mom keeps in her bedside drawer. We don't even speculate on it. I'm pretty sure we are all aware it would traumatize us more than her.\n\nETA: After re-reading what I wrote, this actually makes more of the point of how \"not having privacy\" is more about control. My parents weren't controlling. PITA, sometimes, sure, but they weren't controlling. We heard about this rope swing when we were teenagers and told our parents we were gonna go find it and my dad said \"check for rocks before you do anything crazy\" and my mom said, \"I just washed some towels\", and \"take my minivan instead of your car, that way everyome will have a seatbelt\" and threw me her keys.... my bad y'all.",

Judges are elected, so they can get political donations. DCF in a lot of states gets a percentage of child support, so there's pressure to keep the $ amount high. Also this state is perpetually broke, and child support which leaves the state doesn't get spent in state and doesn't generate revenue through sales tax and other vehicles. Only 44% of children in this state get child support paid in full, so there's a lot of \"deadbeats.\" Add in \"Christians\" and conservatives who dominate politics and believe \"children need their mothers full time\" well, men don't get their kids here unless the mother can't be found.\n\nGiven the perfect storm of an out-of-state father (military) who made double the median income, who had a perfect record of payment going back a decade, (because the military makes sure you support your kids, by force if necessary) no way would a judge down here hand over custody. While my husband's case might have generated less than $1000/year in state revenue, multiple that by the thousands of military members stationed here who married a local girl and got divorced, and that starts to be a pretty good chunk of change that stays in state to be spent on the local economy rather than a smaller amount leaving the state and being spent elsewhere. \n\nLuckily for him/us, her lawyer was unfamiliar with federal law and believed the 10-year myth, so didn't go after his pension.",

I know this one from personal experience - not a sketchbook, but a diary. My mother used to read mine, which I found out when she cornered me one night and told me that nothing I wrote was actually what had happened, and that I wasn't allowed to write or even *think* bad things about her, or that she was anything other than a perfect parent. This after years of mostly emotional but occasionally physical abuse. If someone tells you that everything you've experienced is invalid and wrong, and threatens or forces you into psychiatric care if you don't immediately back down?
