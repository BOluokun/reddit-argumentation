  "post content": "I'm feeling out of my Mind at this point. Everyone is telling me I'm an AH.\n\nMy dog has been my companion for 6 years. She slept in my bed, she had free rein of the house. But she's also well trained. Never has accidents in the house, never disobeys commands (she knows alot), and she's so friendly with all other dogs. \n\nMy (34M) GF (J, 32F) and I have been fighting about my dog for 2 weeks now. I'm confused because J and I have lived together for almost 2 years. So she has lived with the dog all this time. \n\nBut we're about to buy a house and I guess that's where the fight started. But I was shocked. She went from living with and loving our dog to suddenly saying she has to go. I've tried to talk to her about it and her main argument is that our dog's fur will be everywhere. I always thought we had a clean place but I said I'd still be responsible for any fur (I always have been the main person to clean anyway). She still said we should give my dog to her aunt. Her main concern is her parents, who are strongly Anti-Dog for reasons I don't know. (I asked once and then backed off)\n\nI am sympathetic but I absolutely refuse to rehome my dog that I love to HER aunt, who my dog does not know. Am I being ridiculous? I had no clue this would be a problem. J even seems dismayed by the idea of us parting from our dog, but she deems it necessary. \n\nHer 3 siblings are telling me I'm an A-hole for not understanding her situation. (Maybe I am, but I can't understand a situation when I'm not told?) My parents also say I'm in the wrong because our relationship should come before anything. My brother is on my side.\n\nEdit: WOW. I didn't expect this many comments! Sorry if I don't get back to every single one but I'll do my best a little later today. A few things though, since I've heard them a lot:\n\n1. A lot of people telling me to not give up my dog under any circumstances. So I just want to make it clear that that will never, ever happen. \n\n2. People also pointed out that GF's parents or someone else in their family planned on moving in. Reading that made me sick to my stomach because it rang so true, for a lot of reasons.\n\n3. No pet tax...I'm sorry! Some of GF's friends are on Reddit and I don't want them to find this.\n\nEdit #2: Just another thing I wanted to add as I've gone over the comments. I saw a lot of people saying not to buy a house with someone I'm not married to. But one of them also said not to do so with my \"girlfriend of 2 years.\" So I wanted to say we have actually been dating for closer to 5 years, living together almost 2. Don't know if that will change anyone's advice but I thought I would add it.\n\nEdit #3 and Final: THE AWARDS! I just want to say I'm blown away today. Thank You Everyone but your comments and support and upvotes are more than enough. I just needed for someone to tell me I wasn't being over the top when everyone around me is using that \"it's just a dog\" casualness without saying that directly.",

By becoming a family together, I needed to accept that dogs will be a part of our family.\n\nYour girlfriend's demands are very unreasonable.  She seems like she should know that dogs are important to you, and that's a pretty major thing to hit you with unilaterally.\n\nBut really, this is bigger than the dog.  What do you see the future of this relationship being?  Marriage?  Kids?  If this is a preview of how she solves problems, then I think you need to give some serious consideration.\n\nIf your girlfriend determined that she didn't want to have a dog as part of her home life, and decided to end your relationship over it...   It might be a bit extreme, but it's understandable.  But, demanding you give up your dog is not okay.",

Either you give up your pet to placate your GF or you state clearly that the pet stays and GF can choose what she wants to do. \n\nEither way, your house purchasing plans should be put on hold until this is solved.\n\nIs it possible the GF associates buying a house with starting a family? Many people seemingly have hang-ups with babies and pets, but that should\u2019ve been said from the get-go. Maybe she thought that the dog was like a replacement baby until a real baby comes along. OP, do you know for sure that she isn\u2019t pregnant? Maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s so adamant about it. Either way - OP, if you don\u2019t want kids yet, make sure to cover that particular area of your back. Not to sound too alarming, but if the reason is kids, there could always be an \u2018oops\u2019 and then she could proclaim that giving your dog away has become a necessity. \n\nSecondly, get your dog chipped and if possible (not sure if there are such, but if they exist, get one) get the dog a collar tag that has a tracking device or something. Reason? There have been plenty of SO\u2019s who think that if the pet \u2018goes missing\u2019 then the problem is solved. Make sure that you know the pounds and dog shelters in your area, because it is possible that in the event of your decision not being to her liking, she might take your pet to a pound when you are away at work or somewhere else. If you do end up breaking over this, make sure to change your locks and that she cannot have access to your dog, because snubbed SO\u2019s have been known to steal or let loose their exes pets for punishment.\n\nThird, make sure to make your GF know that the house you will purchase is not a long-term hosting situation for any of her relatives (that means for you too, of course). It is possible that she could have an idea that someone who dislikes dogs will be moving in later. Do you happen to know if your in laws have plans to retire or sell their own accommodation? Maybe your SO\u2019s siblings? \n\nYour GF has a reasoning as to why she is doing it and unless she can tell you exactly why, you\u2019ve both come to a line in the sand. You\u2019re a good pet owner for not giving your pet away! Do not buy the house until you have all the details hashed and hammered out - you may lose out on a \u2018dream house\u2019 but any \u2018dream house\u2019 you purchase with these kinds of strings will become an expensive \u2018house of horrors\u2019.",
