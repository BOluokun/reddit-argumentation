If you want some insight, here: girls and young women are romantically & sexually pursued to the point that they feel like prey instead of human beings sometimes. The less you know about someone, the worse their proposition seems because then it's clear it's only for superficial reasons. So, from her perspective, you are a stranger who made a pass at her when all she wanted was a friendly exchange. That's not what it was, but that's definitely how it sounded. A simple \"oh, I'm sorry, that's not what I meant\" would have sufficed on your end, for future reference.",
