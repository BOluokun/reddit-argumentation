  "post content": "Me and my GF were together for 3.5 years until I found her fucking my brother. After that, I didn't talk to either of them for a year. Our parents have been trying to get us to reconcile and invited us both for dinner at their place. I'm doing much better than I was a year ago, I have a great GF and I've found a very high paying job. I figured that I could maybe salvage a relationship with my brother. My GF didn't come to dinner because she had an emergency at work, so it was just my, my brother, Ex GF, and my Mom. It was going OK until my brother asked if I was seeing anyone. I told him about by GF and he asked why she wasn't here. Here's where I think I may have been the A hole. I said, I didn't want to bring her considering the stat line. He asked me what I meant and I told him that the last time I introduced him to a GF of mine, he fucked her. As it stands, I'm 0 for 1. He got angry immediately and left with Ex GF. My mom scolded me for ruining the attempt at reconciliation. AITA?",

He had that coming. Was it reasonable in the situation, no. This man and your ex completely disrespected your relationship, and I personally would never tolerate sitting down to dinner with them... BUTTTTTTT.... If you want to have a relationship with your brother, you prolly shouldn\u2019t say things like that. Having said that, I have zero issue with public shaming for shameful actions, and he should have taken that slap with apologetic grace, because what he did to you was unforgivable imho... Getting angry and storming off (because you spoke the truth about your feelings)  instead of owning his mistake and giving you the public apology that you DESERVED, just goes to show you that he\u2019s not sorry for his actions. If your parents want to give you hell for it, share this paragraph with them. They should understand that your brother did a vile thing to family that crossed some very serious ethical lines. \n\nNTA, and mooooooost excellent come-back!\n\nEdit: My first award! Thank you guys!",
