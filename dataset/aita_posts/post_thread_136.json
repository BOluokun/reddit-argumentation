  "post content": "My brother Terry is non-verbal and, according to his specialist, has the intellectual/mental capacity of a very young child. Terry can still be very difficult to look after. He will experience meltdowns if something makes him uncomfortable (such as a food texture he does not like) or will throw fits if he cannot have his way. Terry has broken holes in the walls during his meltdowns/fits and I am honestly afraid of him whenever he becomes destructive that way because he is larger/stronger than me.\n\nI had been parentified by the time I was about thirteen because my parents expected me to handle Terry\u2019s needs whenever they were busy or needed a break (which was often.) I have been upfront with my parents that I still hold resentment towards them because of this, and that Terry should not have been my responsibility to the extent they made him. My parents insist their parenting was perfect and are unwilling to alter their viewpoint. I have told them that I am not going to be Terry\u2019s caregiver and to not leave him with me.\n\nUnfortunately, my parents know where I live. Recently, my parents have begun ringing my doorbell, telling me to watch Terry, and then leaving before I can say anything back. Then I\u2019d have to cancel my plans and wait on the porch with Terry until they came back. When they came back, I told them all four times to stop doing this, but was ignored every time. I was forced to call out of work for the most recent \u201cdrop-off\u201d incident. I lost my temper with my mother when she came to pick Terry up and told her that if she or my father try to leave Terry with me even one more time, I will call Adult Protective Services and report Terry as abandoned.\n\nA few days later, my mother again dropped Terry off on my porch and took off. So I followed through with my word and called to report Terry as an abandoned disabled adult. I waited with him on the porch until a social worker came. My parents exploded on me, calling me a horrible daughter and sister. They said they were barely able to get Terry back and accused me of only caring about myself and wanting Terry to be neglected in a public group home. I snapped at them that Terry would probably be better off in a public group home because they\u2019re the ones neglecting him for their own convenience. And that I\u2019m not going to keep putting my life on pause for their own personal comfort anymore.\n\nNow people (mostly friends of my parents) who I barely even knew or remembered before, are bombarding me with messages calling me selfish. A few have approached me in public to tell me that I don\u2019t give a shit about my brother and I\u2019m ungrateful for all the sacrifices that my parents made for me and Terry. I\u2019ve already changed my phone number. But it\u2019s getting so bad that I am considering applying for a job transfer and moving. AITA and are their words toward me deserved?\n\nUpdate: Hello, everyone. I am not sure if anyone is still reading this post. But I wanted to give a brief update in case anyone is still interested. I applied for the job transfer and was approved. I will be completely moved to my new city in a few weeks. I have only told a few close friends, so they could help me move discretely. I have not told my parents that I am moving or my new address. And my friends know to either not tell them or give them an imaginary address. I wanted to thank everyone for your kind words and support. :)",

Somebody made the good call to have him admitted to psych, on a 3 month hold.\n\nWhich sucks, but -it's not because of his mental health, it's to keep him off the streets while they find him a spot in a nursing home.

And don't let them know where you live. And pray for Terry if you pray, or visit Terry if he winds up in a home, and give what you can to him. And I commiserate with your early adulthood. For very different reasons I was also needing to be grown very young. It sucks. Your boundaries are reasonable. It is a sad situation. They are handling it, in their desperation, like monsters. NTA",

With that success it reinforced the behavior so they will definitely use it again. People hate change. It\u2019s easier for them to send their flying monkeys to harass OP than find another solution. They\u2019re attempting to guilt OP into doing what they want. This is very normal behavior for someone like this. OP needs to just stand firm and not give in. Better to not engage as well and it still might get worse before it gets better. Because if it worked last time then they may just ramp up the harassment in hopes that OP will give in. But eventually when they see OP is serious it will taper off/stop. But it will be very important that OP not let them win this.
