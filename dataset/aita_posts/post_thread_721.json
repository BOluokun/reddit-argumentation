  "post content": "Me and my girlfriend have been going out for over a year now, we just moved in together and we decided to throw a moving in party. The party was maybe 25-40 people, I honestly couldn't count because a lot of people were coming in and going out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, my girlfriend had control over the music. She was playing... kind of really bland edm-pop stuff like a edm remix of a taylor swift song and ed sheeran and stuff, and I could just absolutely tell that nobody was into it. I think this might be somewhat of an urban/suburban divide, she is from the suburbs where the radio is more popular in general. For one, most of the people there were people I knew, and I know that they wouldn't like it, but also I talked to a few of my friends and they said the music was annoying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI decided to ask her if I could play some music, something that was... you know, crowd pleasing (early 2000s hip hop hits, of course), and not just music that I personally enjoy, and right away you could see people get more excited from the music. About 4-5 songs later, she asked if she could play more music, and I told her yes, but play something different than what she was playing before because a lot of people weren't into it. She got a tiny bit upset at that, and she kept asking me to explain what I meant, and I just said that people didn't want to hear pop music at a party like that, and she got kind of really pissed off at me and took it as a personal attack on her music taste. I kept telling her that it wasn't me, it was more the guests. Truth be told, I didn't like it much either, and I think she could tell that it was also me, but I personally didn't CARE about the music, its more that it was mellowing out the party in a bad way because people didnt like it. She ended up getting really frustrated at me, saying that we've been dating for over a year and I never told her that I thought her music taste was bad. Like, why would I tell her that? We have different music tastes, she knows that. I think she was kind of in denial that the PARTY didn't like the music, and assumed it was entirely ME who was disliking the music. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe ended up going upstairs in a pout, and the next day she went to Chicago for a work trip so we have barely spoken since. I felt like an asshole the entire night. I probably shouldn't have said anything about that, it just came off like I was telling her that her music sucked, but she also kind of put me in a tough position there.",

You both have shitty taste in music and you trying to make it into a city/suburb thing is just amusing to be honest. \n\nShe's TA for overreacting, but she is not the asshole for her music taste.

Everyone knows them, they're fun and dancey. Everyone loves Hey Ya and Missy Elliot, especially if they're millennials. Judging by the example he gave of what she was playing, that would not be received well at... any party I can think of.",

This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nMe and my girlfriend have been going out for over a year now, we just moved in together and we decided to throw a moving in party. The party was maybe 25-40 people, I honestly couldn't count because a lot of people were coming in and going out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, my girlfriend had control over the music. She was playing... kind of really bland edm-pop stuff like a edm remix of a taylor swift song and ed sheeran and stuff, and I could just absolutely tell that nobody was into it. I think this might be somewhat of an urban/suburban divide, she is from the suburbs where the radio is more popular in general. For one, most of the people there were people I knew, and I know that they wouldn't like it, but also I talked to a few of my friends and they said the music was annoying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI decided to ask her if I could play some music, something that was... you know, crowd pleasing (early 2000s hip hop hits, of course), and not just music that I personally enjoy, and right away you could see people get more excited from the music. About 4-5 songs later, she asked if she could play more music, and I told her yes, but play something different than what she was playing before because a lot of people weren't into it. She got a tiny bit upset at that, and she kept asking me to explain what I meant, and I just said that people didn't want to hear pop music at a party like that, and she got kind of really pissed off at me and took it as a personal attack on her music taste. I kept telling her that it wasn't me, it was more the guests. Truth be told, I didn't like it much either, and I think she could tell that it was also me, but I personally didn't CARE about the music, its more that it was mellowing out the party in a bad way because people didnt like it. She ended up getting really frustrated at me, saying that we've been dating for over a year and I never told her that I thought her music taste was bad. Like, why would I tell her that? We have different music tastes, she knows that. I think she was kind of in denial that the PARTY didn't like the music, and assumed it was entirely ME who was disliking the music. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe ended up going upstairs in a pout, and the next day she went to Chicago for a work trip so we have barely spoken since. I felt like an asshole the entire night. I probably shouldn't have said anything about that, it just came off like I was telling her that her music sucked, but she also kind of put me in a tough position there.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
