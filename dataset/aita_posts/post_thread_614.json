  "post content": "Hi this is my first time posting here and I'm on mobile so excuse any typos. So the other night I was with my mom watching pirates of the caribbean on a rainy night. When it rains hard it floods our backyard so after watching the movie we got up to look at how flooded the yard was. My mom then fainted and fell on the ground and we weren't sure if she hit her head (it was just me and her in the house). So I called the ambulance and she was took to the hospital. I was pretty shook up at this point and I wanted to talk to somone so I texted my freind and told her what happened. All she said back to my text was \"shit\" and didn't respond for 15 min. At that point I had gotten pretty worked up because our freind ship is bassicaly just me helping her threw her problems while she does nothing at all to help me. So I ended up going off on her and told her it was fucked up that I told her my mom fainted and hit her head and she  asked absolutely no questions. And her only excuse was she was with her bf. I think I'm overreacting and I shouldn't depend on other people to support me at all but am I the ass hole. And yea my mom's fine.",
