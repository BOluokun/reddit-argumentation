  "post content": "I\u2019m currently in a relationship with my Gf of 4 years, and she has a daughter (we\u2019ll call Susie) who is 7 years old, who we share with her Dad every other week. Recently we found out through the new Gf of the dad (through social media, mutual friend who makes shirts) that they had \u201cFamily shirts\u201d done for a Disneyland trip. So we ask Susie, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell us you were going to Disneyland?\u201d out of genuine curiosity. And she looks at us confused has no idea what we\u2019re talking about. \n\nFast forward a month or so, we pick up Susie from school on the beginning of our week, and she\u2019s going on about how much fun she had at her Grandmas house. During a school week. We then found out that the Dad, new GF, and 2 sons, had gone off on a Disneyland trip with out his ACTUAL daughter, during the school week, and couldn\u2019t even let us have her a day early, (but that\u2019s not that important). The 2 sons, are from the new GFs previous relationships, no way related to the Dad. We ask Susie why didn\u2019t they take her too. And she says because then it would be an odd number and not everyone can go on the ride at the same time (or some bull crap excuse like that). \n\nSometime during our week we\u2019re in the car talking about this situation amongst my GF and I. Then Susie shouts, \u201cthey said they\u2019re going to bring me back a gift to make up for it, and they\u2019re going to take me next time\u201d. I then say, \u201cwhether they bring you a gift or not, they still both suck for not taking you\u201d. So then when she goes back on her week, she ends up telling her dad what I said, and honestly. I didn\u2019t give a shit because I meant it. This if screwed up in my book, how do you exclude a little girl from a trip to Freaking DISNEYLAND. \n\nNext time we meet to exchange Susie, the dad walks up to my window and says I better keep my F****** mouth shut and stop telling my daughter bad things about him, and threatens me, and on and on. Granted, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever said anything about the dad, because drama isn\u2019t my thing. So I get out of the car, (because I ain\u2019t no bitch and am size-ably larger than him, just in case if had to hold my own ground, ididnt want to have to defend myself from the seat of my car) and just explained I wasn\u2019t lying, and asked him man to man, in front of his daughter and my Gf, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t Susie go with you guys to Disneyland?\u201d He had a couple of excuses. That it was his new GFs sons first time going, and they wanted it to be about them, not that my GFs daughter couldn\u2019t go, but because she wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it as much as someone who hasn\u2019t been there before. He then also said, because she had already been there with us that she didn\u2019t need to go this time (we had taken my GFs daughter to Disney land, the 3 of us, about 2 years ago). He then keeps going back to how he never talks bad about me (even though they do) and that he\u2019s a good dad and that he doesn\u2019t suck. The exchange never escalated past some mild shouting, and both parties left. \n\nMy GF is annoyed that the situation didn\u2019t need to happen, but does agree what the Dad and New GF did wasn\u2019t okay. So, AITA for being honest in front of the daughter and saying her dad and \u201cstep mom\u201d sucked. \n\nTLDR: Child gets excluded from Disney land family trip (Dad, Step mom, and step moms sons go, but not his biological daughter) I tell her that her Dad and Step mom suck. Dad attempts to confront me in person, but then put him on the spotlight in front of daughter, and explains that they have another trip planned for her in the future. Also says since we\u2019ve already taken her to Disneyland, it\u2019s okay she misses this trip. Dad claims I\u2019m manipulating daughter, but have never said anything about Dad before. Gf gets annoyed, but agrees with me. ",

The father did that when he excluded his own daughter from a trip to Disney land. \n\nSecond, the daughter needs to know that this kind of behavior isn\u2019t okay. If no one stood up for her/told her that the dad\u2019s actions are wrong, she would accept it as normal. And that\u2019s NOT normal. Allowing her to think that being excluded by her father is normal sets her up for major boundary issues in the future. No one told me the shit my extended family said to me was wrong to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d and I ended up letting people walk all over me as a teenager because I thought that was acceptable behavior. \n\nThird, it is his business. If he\u2019s been dating the GF for 4 years and she\u2019s 7, hrs been involved in the daughter\u2019s life since she was three. Given he himself took her to Disney, it obvious he plays a parental role in this girl\u2019s life. Parental figures need to stand up for their children, even if they\u2019re step-kids. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t seem to be using the kid as a weapon in the divorce. He seems to genuinely care about this child and is upset that her father is treating her like shit. I don\u2019t love how he handled the situation, it was kind of immature, but his heart was in the right place and he is NTA. The bio dad is. A trip to Disney as a 7 year old isn\u2019t petty. That\u2019s a big deal and she was excluded from that, which I\u2019m sure would make her feel excluded from the family. ",
