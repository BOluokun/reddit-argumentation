The one who was fired bullied students and made it hard for us for no reason. \n\nHe made fun of a kid who had a kidney disease for asking to not participate in dodge ball because he was having kidney problems. He also made him sit out that day of PE and didn't even allow him to go to the nurse. He later made fun of the same kid for not having a dad. (The kid's dad had died in the military.) After the FC made him sit out , he talked to him for a bit. The situation escalated like this. FC: I'm going to need you to get your dad to sign a note. Kid: I Don't have a daddy. FC: What? Excuse me? Kid: My dad died. FC: HAH! Alright sure , get your MOM to sign this then. (Then commences to lecture him on how he shouldn't lie and how he should respect the coach. Kid is crying at this point and FC gets even angrier.\n\nAfter this incident me and my friend group were plotting to beat the FC up. Before we could set the plan into motion though , my friend apparently told his grandma everything who then went to the principle and got him fired. That was at the end of that year , so naturally we assumed that we would get a replacement coach, Since there was supposed to 2 because these coaches had to supervise 4 classes , but we ended up only having 1 coach despite the 4 classes. Enter AC. He hadn't been hostile or unfair to us the year before , despite going along with FC's actions. We quickly realized that he wasn't as bad , but he still bullied us. Sorry for the long setup , so here's the story I wanted to tell. It happened around the same time as our school's Christmas play. It had rained outside and they were practicing for the play in the gym , so we just sat in the gym and were told not to talk or get up. So basically this won't make sense unless I explain how we were seated. The boys were next to the girls on the bleachers , only separated by the stairs leading up the bleachers and a wooden fold up table place on the bottom of the stairs. I Had my water bottle with me and was taking a sip every once in a while. Fast forward about 10 minutes and I Had my water bottle sitting by my leg , I moved my foot slightly and accidently knocked it over so I went to pick it up and this girl picked it up and put it on the table. (Quick backstory on this girl: She is a bitch to everyone who isn't a teacher , enough said.) I said , \"hey give that back.\" , then she replied , \"You shouldn't have dropped it.\". I Then get up and go pick up the water bottle , just as the coach turns around. \"You aren't supposed to get up , go to the top of the bleachers.\" AC said. I Didn't think that I had to , since I did nothing wrong. I Replied , \"I Was just getting my water.\" At this point all 4 grades were looking at us , \"You still aren't supposed to get up , now go to the top.\" he said. \"I don't need to because I did nothing wrong, SHE moved my water.\" , I said pointing at the girl. \"Either go up there , or go to the office.\" . he said , but I stood my ground because I HATE this coach. I Said , \"Ok , I'll go.\" , In the most calm voice I could muster. I Got up and pushed myself under the table and onto the floor without falling and began to walk away. A few people clapped and others complimented me. Now I know that sounds like something strait out of a tumblr story but It actually happened. I Went to the office , explained the situation to the vice principal , who then called my mom and let me explain it to her. We both then went to see the coach , because by the time I was done in the office PE had ended for the day. When talking to the vice principal ,AC lied stating that I didn't say anything about my water bottle. When we left on the way back to the office I explained that AC was lying , but they ended up trusting the coach. The Vice principal and my mom agreed that I wasn't in trouble , but that I should've made a better attempt to tell the AC about my water bottle. In the end , what got me in trouble at home was the fact that I legit forgot to tell my dad about it. When he calmed down though he agreed that I wasn't in the wrong. (He was a bit flustered because I don't usually get in trouble.)Also ,(The same day) In class when I was talking to friends they were all congratulating me on what it did. So , Am I the asshole for standing up to a coach?\n",

Sure it is frustrating and not fair, but life isn't fair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo the teacher, it was just another moment of his day. This is way more important and impactful on your life, so its highly unlikely he didn't hear you and just wanted to move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't get too upset about it, I doubt he is trying to challenge your honor, just keep order.",
