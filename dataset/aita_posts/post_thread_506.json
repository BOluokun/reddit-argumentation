  "post content": "Hey guys. So a little background first - my GF (21) and I (22) have been together for a little over a year. I am a very sensitive, mushy-gushy guy with a real loving personality. I love pleasing people and making them feel good. On the other hand, she is super caring and loving just not as mushy-gushy and definitley not nearly as sensitive but this has a lot to do with our upbringings as she didn\u2019t grow up in a great home.\n\nThe only thing that we\u2019ve EVER fought about since we\u2019ve started dating is how she talks. Another thing about her is that her humor is sarcasm so she loves to tease and make jabs (mostly in a rather cute manner) but sometimes her words and tone can really bother me and this is the main reason I\u2019m writing this. She can at times not be aware that some of her sarcasm can come across as rude, passive aggressive, or even just aggressive to people that don\u2019t know her or even people that do know her (I sometimes still feel the aggression!). Some examples below:\n\n-friends hanging out, being goofy, acting stupid and asking stupid questions to be funny and she will just out of nowhere be like \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just asked that are you dumb!?\u201d And sometimes there\u2019s just a slight moment of awkwardness like \u201cok relax jeez\u201d\n\n-Also sometimes when she tells me she\u2019s going to do things, naturally my response is \u201coh yeah that\u2019s fine\u201d just cause that\u2019s my normal response and she always has to respond with \u201coh thanks for your permission\u201d which is just SO ANNOYING like why do you have to make it that way??\n\nWe\u2019ve had many talks on this, some going better than others where she asks how after all this time of us dating that I can\u2019t see when she\u2019s being sarcastic and asks me why I need to take everything so literally and I end up feeling shitty because maybe I let my sensitivity get the best of me. Then there have been other conversations where I tell her that how I feel is how I feel, and nothing is wrong with that, but there is something wrong if you choose to ignore it. At this point though, this convo has come up many times to where she thinks I\u2019m attacking her character and her personality and making her out to be some bully which I don\u2019t want to do. But I do want her to see that there\u2019s sometimes no reason to speak the way she does, even if it\u2019s intended as a joke!\n\nAnyways, the real question here is if I am in the right to be going at her for this stuff. I do love her more than anything else in this world and she is an amazing girlfriend who has been there for me through the most hardest points in my life, but I don\u2019t want to eventually snap later on by trying to ignore this stuff that obviously bothers me deep down. \n\nEDIT: Perhaps some important things I forgot to mention (1) We dated for a year at the end of high school then decided to part ways since I was going away to school and she was going through family troubles. Got back together Oct. 2021 and (2) we now have been living together for a little over a month.\n\nTL:DR - GF (21 F) has a very sarcastic personality and sometimes can come across as rude and I\u2019m (22 M) trying to figure out if I\u2019m right in being upset by it sometimes or if I\u2019m just attacking who she is and being an A-hole.",

I would laugh and throw it right back at her, but you're taking it so seriously.\n\nDevil's advocate: language is a 2-part experience. How you perceive it has just as much impact as how she intends it. You've tried asking her to change. Have you tried to change?\n\nSome personality types just don't mesh well together.

My mom is the same way if not worse, and I almost wish I wasn\u2019t brought up to be so soft.\n\nI want to learn how to care less to be honest. I know it\u2019s hard to give advice on a relationship based on one post, but I really do love her and we are so happy in so many other areas. So all these comments saying we are incompatible while they are appreciated, I can think of a million ways besides this as to how we are. I\u2019m nowhere near a point where I want to give up.",

              "content": "My comment about incompatibility comes from personal experience where people kept taking issue with everything I said. It doesn't take long to stop feeling the love, even if everything else lines up perfectly. \n\nI would try reframing your mindset for sure. She's not being immoral or rude, she's showing you she trusts you. Most sarcastic people turn it off at work, as an example, because they aren't comfortable there. \n\nUsually sarcasm is also meant to show that something doesn't matter. You know, let's say you're insecure about your driving. I might say something sarcastic about it to show you it's okay. You don't need to be insecure. I know that probably sounds twisted, but she's using a tool to connect with you. It's just different than the tools that you use. \n\nI would also suggest being cautious while bringing it up to her. Some topics might be off-limits, and that's okay, but rather than just saying \"never ever be sarcastic!\" pick one or two things to start with. And don't expect it to immediately change, it's really hard to change language that you've been developing your whole life. \n\nAnd maybe for the hell of it, with one of these things you know she's prone to saying (like the permission comment), try throwing it back to her and see how you feel. You can even prepare a response since you know it'll come up. It might feel less serious if you can recognize that you didn't mean the sarcastic thing when you said it. \n\nGood luck!",

If you cannot change your perspective at all on this, you two are not compatible. Full stop.

      "content": "NTA.\n\nI say this as someone who was/is similar to your GF. I grew up in a family that ribbed each other and made sarcastic comments toward each other and that was how I learned to be \"funny.\"\n\nBut its not really funny to most people. A lot of the time it comes off rude and passive aggressive. It hurts people's feelings even if you don't intend for it to. And a lot of people aren't willing to put up with it. My partner has been really patient with me unlearning it. I started really defensive about it, but have been getting better (I think).\n\nPeople that say its \"just her personality\" are kinda right in a way. It IS part of her personality, but personalities can also change. We learn and unlearn different behaviors, and just because its ingrained doesn't mean it can't change. The issue, I think, is that she's defensive about it. If she feels like she's walking on eggshells then she can't tell the difference between funny sarcasm and not funny sarcasm. Its a line you have to learn if she grew up in any way similar to how I did.\n\nIf she cares about you, she shouldn't WANT to hurt your feelings. I'm not implying that she does want to hurt you, either. She's probably feeling threatened because it's what she knows. Changing the status quo is scary for a lot of people. But if you want to put in the time and patience to help her unlearn it (if she wants to), it is possible.\n\nShe needs to realize that this isn't the only way for her to be interesting or funny to others. She can add other things to a conversation that aren't these sarcastic comments, and she'll probably feel better for it because her realtionships might end up more positive as a result. It could also come from a place of feeling unheard in conversations and feeling like she has to add SOMETHING just to be heard (it did for me, so that could also be projecting). If you come at it with love and honesty, she might be able to reflect and open up about something. I hope so at least.\n\nTake all of this with a grain of salt, of course, a lot of it is projecting my own experiences onto you and your GF. But maybe something will resonate!\n\nI hope the two of you can come to an understanding. It'll probably require a lot of patience and understanding on your end that she will not always get it right. You will have to correct her (privately) and maybe explain things. Meanwhile, she'll have to really reflect on the things she says and unlearn the impulsive desire to say her little sarcastic quips. But if you work together and you both put in honest effort, it can get better. I'm rooting for you! :)",
