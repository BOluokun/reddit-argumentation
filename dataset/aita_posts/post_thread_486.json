  "post content": "AITA here in this situation? I recently bought ingredients to cook my own food with my own money. So my dad often would use the kitchen to lounge and cook but it's usually once or twice a week. So after cooking my meal, my dad came home from eating out since he's lazy. I just came back from the gym and cooked my food for almost an hour. Him seeing the kitchen not up to his standard starts mouthing off about how dirty it is, how disgusting the area looks like and so on with sarcasm thrown in.\n\nI was so hungry after cooking that I wanted to eat first before cleaning up and still prior to that, I actually washed up the pots before indulging in my food.\n\nMy dad had too much to say and I just couldn't take it, my plate was still 3/4 full and I just had to throw it down the trash. I am so pissed off right now. What's his fucking problem? Is it wrong for me to cook? For me to eat? For me to wash it later after my fucking meal? What the fuck is wrong with him? I'm 24 so I'm an adult not a kid.\n\nAm I the ass hole? He said I'm a cry baby for taking it to heart. How are you going to finish your food when you hear a piece of shit mouthing off at what you cooked and how oily the table is.\n\nEdit: there is something that I have to add. My dad is jobless. Good for nothing men living in a house with expenses paid by my mum and me so him telling me to off what to and not to do when he contributes nothing is what made me even more pissed off",

You did that all on your own. He didnt make you throw it away. \n\nAnd if this is an everyday thing. Clean as you go whike you cook. Its not that hard. I do it. And so does my chef of a fiance. Its easier to maintain and it doesnt get you yelled at. Yeah you're an adult, but youre acting like a 17yo.",

Why not just tell him you'll clean it when you're done eating and to leave you alone. If hes still acting like that plug some headphones in and tune him out. Then go clean the mess. There was no reason to get so upset and throw food out that you spent time and money on. Im not siding with your dad, because he sucks, but im not siding with you either. You acted immature in the moment and he got what he wanted. \n\nWhich was you cleaning the mess right then and there, all while wasting food that you just made. If it was half of it, it would have taken you what 10 more minutes to eat the rest, THEN go clean ? Thats not long. Yeah hearing your parents bitch at you for nonsense sucks but i definitely wouldn't have thriwn away perfectly good food just because he was a jerk.",

I.e., you throw some chicken on the grill, and while it is cooking, you throw away the trash you had out of clean the plate you had the raw chicken on. Or things like that.\n\nAnd besides that, I would just try to understand how hunger affects your emotions. It is pretty hard in the moment, but after the fact you often think; \"Why was I even that mad about that? Seems like a small issue\" and you can eventually attribute that to just the fact that you were hungry and irritable.\n\nDon't throw away your meal though lol, especially if you took the time to cook/prep it yourself.

If it is as bad as you say it is, then make progress to moving out. Start saving up money instead of giving it to him to gamble away, and make a solid plan and timeline to give up.\n\nYou threw away your food and lowered your caloric intake because you got upset.
