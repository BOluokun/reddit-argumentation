  "post content": "I'll try to make this short because I hate reading long posts on here.\n\nMy wife and I went shopping at a mall today and decided to pick up some food at one of the restaurants attached to the mall (not food court, but sit down restaurant). It was around 5pm, so right at the start of dinner rush. Service was fine and our server was incredibly friendly.\n\nToward the end of our meal, a family (father, mother, and son probably around 8 years old) are seated in the booth behind us. By this time, it was getting a bit busier in the restaurant. It takes maybe 2-3 minutes before the server comes and takes their drink orders. She then went to tend to that and other tables. \n\nAbout 5 minutes pass and I hear the father start complaining. \"Why is everything taking so long?\" \"This server is lazy.\" \"It's been five minutes, why hasn't she taken our order?\" \"The service here is terrible, they deserve a 4/10 rating.\" \"Maybe I need to speak to the manager.\" \n\nIt was driving me crazy because it was fucking dinner time and they were busy. My wife and I finish our meal and pay. As we are leaving, I step over their booth and just very kindly address the father \"Excuse me, hi, so we were sitting at the booth behind you, and just so you know, you're a real prick.\" And then I walked out before he could respond.\n\nMy wife thinks I was totally justified because our server was super nice and kind, but I just wonder if I overstepped myself. So reddit, am I the asshole or does everyone suck (because seriously, fuck that guy)?",
