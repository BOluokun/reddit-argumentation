  "post content": "Background info: \nI (25f) have been bullied by peers for my nose since 4th grade. My mom has also contributed to my insecurities since I was little. I have some features that are plainly my fathers and some that are plainly my mothers. When I was a teenager, my mom made comments like \u201cwhen I saw your first ultrasound photo\u2019s I thought \u2018poor child, she has *father\u2019s name\u2019s* nose\u201d. I still remember how I felt then. She would also comment on her own appearance, things I inherited from her, without realizing she was making me think about myself in the same way. My maternal grandmother has also said things about my appearance. This past Christmas while visiting my family, she said \u201cthe grandchildren sure did get prettier the more we had them\u201d while looking at me. I am the eldest. \n\nI am not ugly. I have a nice frame, hair, eyes, and smile. But my nose is certainly the first thing you notice. It\u2019s very deviated and large. I used to be against surgery, but now that I am approaching my late twenties, I honestly just want to feel beautiful while I\u2019m young. I want to not feel insecure when I go anywhere. If i get married, i want to feel beautiful in those pictures. I don\u2019t want to shy away from photos. I want to feel confident. \n\nNow to the recent issue. \n\nI recently began exploring surgery options. Bottom line, because it is cosmetic, insurance will pay nothing. I can afford 1/3 of the cost and have asked my parents if they would be willing to help. My father inherited a good amount of money about two years ago. They talked about it and eventually decided not to because it is an expensive surgery. I try to respect their decision because it is their money and I am not entitled to it. \n\nWell, I recently found out they are going to build a concrete patio very soon. I understand they can do what they want, but it just hurt I guess. I kind of gave my mom a hard time about how she used to make me feel insecure and now she feels bad. There was also a time where I was having to sleep on a dog bed in an apartment across the state because I couldn\u2019t afford a mattress and my dad refused to drive the one I had bought previously. Two months later they bought a brand new mattress for themselves while I was still sleeping on a dog bed. I guess this surgery issue brought up those kind of feelings again and I feel guilty for holding it against them. \n\nAITA for resenting my parents for not helping out after the years of insecurity they gave me?\n\n\n****edit below ****\n\nI appreciate the constructive criticism. I am still probably going to get the surgery for myself with my own money. For those asking, I never demanded money or yelled/belittled/whatever to my mom when I gave her a \u201chard time\u201d. I also never threw a fit or even complained to them about their answer. This post was more about me feeling guilty because i was internally resenting them. Give me some credit here haha. The conversation with my mom was more that she asked me why I wanted it and I reminded her of all the things she and everyone else said to me and she got sad because she says she didn\u2019t realize what she was saying at the time. I don\u2019t think she was trying to put me down. I do think she never considered how I would take her criticism. \n\nI agree therapy would probably benefit me the most and appreciate the sympathy for how I had been treated. It did suck, it still sucks, but I think everyone has grown from that. It\u2019s just a matter of me being able to move on from this resentment. So yeah thanks for the healthy reminders. Everyone is beautiful :)",

There are tons of people who get plastic surgery, only do one procedure and desire nothing more, and are really happy with it. I got my eyelids done and I wouldn\u2019t call myself ~insecure~, it\u2019s just something I didn\u2019t like and was happy to have it fit in with my face better. Although a minimal procedure, it really increased my enjoyment of life! \n\nWhat would be best is for her to speak to a therapist on whether or not plastic surgery is a healthy choice for her. \n\nOP, get the plastic surgery or not, but don\u2019t expect anyone else to pay for it. It\u2019s your face and your decision, so it should come from your pocket.",

But you recognized you weren't entitled to their financial support before you found out how they planned to spend the money.  This doesn't change that.  And judging by the other issues this seems to be dredging up, I don't think getting them to pay for this would actually make all of that better even if they were open to the idea.  You're going to need to find some other way of dealing with feeling like they don't value you.",

You are an adult now, and you shouldn't really be relying on your parents to help you out financially when it's that expensive. I understand why you're upset about it, as they're the major contributes to your pain and they have the money to spend, but you aren't really their responsibility anymore financially.\n\nThat being said, the way your family treated you as a child is horrible and they should know how terrible it was. Bringing down a literal child based on their appearance or anything else, really, is disgusting. And they wonder why you have issues now.\n\nAlso, the mattress thing in particular is crazy to me. How could they possibly justify letting their kid sleep on a DOG BED because they were too lazy to transport the mattress to you?? The one that you bought *yourself*?? They don't seem like good parents imo. I would honestly try to distance yourself from them; they've made you feel insecure, seem to see little value in you, etc and you don't deserve to be around people like that.",

I don\u2019t know what to tell you, it\u2019s embarrassing. One of my roommates eventually got her friend to give me a mattress and that was probably the most humiliating moment of my life. I only had that sleeping situation for two months before I got a mattress. \n\nMy parents didn\u2019t reimburse me for the mattress I bought, never arranged to buy a new one, and ended up getting a new $500 mattress for themselves.
