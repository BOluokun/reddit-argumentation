  "post content": "I(22F) have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for two years. Last year, he broke his leg which left me to do allllll the driving in the relationship (which i had no issue with). One day I picked him up, and he threw a tantrum about us driving my car because it \u201cisn\u2019t comfortable\u201d. He begged we take his truck to my house, and I reluctantly agreed, and made him aware I wasn\u2019t comfortable driving it/never had driven a truck before. Later that day, he wants me to go pick up something for him and the only vehicle available to drive was his truck. I sucked it up and drove it, then scraped it along a cement pole. Long story short, damages are $1600. I believe we should split this bill, as he was the reason I was driving his truck at all. Also, I am a full time student with no income, meanwhile he makes a healthy salary. Should I pay the entirety with my life savings, when he makes enough in one week to cover the bill? AITA\u2026.",

I don't know if 50/50 is absolutely fair, as you were still behind the wheel and ultimately responsible, but since he can afford it and you can't it would be \"nice\" of him to be willing to pay half.\n\nAnd I hope your lesson learned is not to cave in to his coercion even if he says he's not comfortable. If you're not comfortable driving something, don't do it.",

The only reason to put life/limb at risk by driving such a vehicle on public roads is if life/limb are already at risk and there is no other way to get help. (Pursued by axe murderer? Dead phone/no phone and someone is bleeding out? Go for it.)\n\nSurely, with a decently high salary, he also has decent insurance. If so, pay the deductable (regardless of whether or not he chooses to submit a claim). If not, cover the damages but do not drive him anymore. Let him Uber and never, ever drive his vehicle again.\n\nUnfortunately, it comes down to choice. He's an AH for manipulating you (and you should 100% consider whether this is a relationship that you should continue if he is prone to it), but in the end you chose to drive the truck when you knew that you shouldn't. He acted like a dang toddler and threw a wobbly to get you to agree, but you voluntarily got into the driver's seat.\n\nWhere I live, he could sue you for the damages (or at least his deductable and related expenses) and he would win. This is why you pay and this is also why you shouldn't give him a penny until he signs a statement agreeing that the payment covers all damages and releasing you from further responsibility. (IANAL, just paranoid.)\n\nShould he force you to pay after manipulating you into driving in the first place? Hell no. \n\nCould he legally come after you for it, provided whatever applicable statute of limitations on seeking damages hasn't expired? Yes. \n\nIs he likely to do this while you are still together?  Probably not. \n\nMight he do it if you happen to break up before such a statute expires? Yes, particularly if he is butt hurt over the breakup.\n\nBest to settle up and then decide if you really want to be with him. That said, given the emotional manipulation to get you to drive his vehicle, you are NTA for *wanting* to split the bill. \n\nI'd pay it anyway unless he'll sign something saying that the half payment releases you from any further responsibility. Again, IANAL, just paranoid.",
