  "post content": "My husband, our 16 year old son, and I are going next month to visit our daughter at her college which is a few states away. She is a freshman and has been with her boyfriend Steve for 3 years. Steve is really a great kid, but since money is a bit tighter in his family, he is doing 2 years at junior college while working to save up for the school my daughter attends. We have never taken him on a trip, but since he says money is right, we decided to bring him with on our visit to see our daughter. He visited her once on his own back in the fall, but due to his finances he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford another trip this school year. He was over the moon when we invited him. \n\nWe don\u2019t want him to pay for a single thing. His flight, his hotel room (he will be sharing with our son, they get along really well) and his food and drink will all be paid for by us. And really we are glad to do it. We\u2019ve also never really had a disagreement with Steve until now. \n\nWhen speaking to my daughter about plans, the hotel came up. This is when I found out that my daughters dorm roommate is out of town that weekend. And she plans to have Steve stay in her dorm with her while we visit. I told her absolutely not. I said what they do when we aren\u2019t there is their business, but since we are going to be there and funding this whole trip, he will be staying at the hotel. Call my husband and I old school, or traditionalists, but we are Christians. And the idea of them staying together on our visit makes us uncomfortable. We think we are being rather generous to take him in the first place. \n\nThe word got back to Steve and he actually called me and asked why he couldn\u2019t stay with our daughter. I explained my reasons above and he got irate. He tried to pull the \u201cadult\u201d card. I said Steve,  here is the deal. If you wanna stay with her, that\u2019s fine. You will still be welcome to tag along with our family. But there will be separate checks on every meal. And he could figure out his own way there. He said we know he can\u2019t afford that. And I said all we ask is that you sleep at the hotel. He agreed but now my daughter is saying we embarrassed him and he\u2019s thinking of not coming.",

Obviously, they don't get to do this often so why not just let them be? Your being \"Christians\" doesn't stop them from being who they are and doesn't give you the right to butt into their business. You may not agree with it but they are adults. It's just too bad your generosity is conditional. YTA",

She got me a birth control prescription when I was about 15 (right around when I became sexually active, but a few years before I actually lost my v- card) because she said she'd heard it would help my acne.\n\n\nI accepted the explanation because, aside from the stray pimple when I forgot to wash my makeup off, I was remarkably acne free during those years; a fact I was deeply grateful for as I watched my sisters and friends struggle with breakouts. I always attributed it to my mom putting me on birth control and never questioned it further.\u00a0\n\n\nIt wasn't until I was an adult that it occurred to me I didn't really have acne before the birth control scrip, either. I had a fear of it, but I never had it. It also finally occurred to me (as an adult) that if birth contol was some kind of miracle cure for acne, both my sisters would've taken it, and every woman who struggles with acne ever. So that was pretty dumb, but I totally bought it, and thought I'd had a real lucky break ... which I guess I did, in that my mom absolutely did not want to deal with a teenage pregnancy, and clearly figured I was the most reckless and least well-prepared of her girls.\u00a0",

Because even though you can\u2019t undo a baptism (I looked into it) but Roman Catholic priests and nuns were responsible for ripping Indigenous toddlers and children from their parents. These kids would never see their parents again. Put them in residential schools. Beating them if they spoke their language, cut their hair, stayed in a cold unloving environment. No hugs, kisses goodnight. \nIf a child passed away from being beaten or from disease that they refused to treat, they had the other kids dig a mass grave and bury them. Little girls were SA. If she ended up pregnant, after they delivered those babies, the priest would unalive them. The kids would plaster them into holes in the basement walls. Many other stories. \nI am disgusted by this religion. I thought there was a vow, Thou shall not kill? Where does this all fit in, with these innocent babies and children, just because of the colour of their skin? Then sweep it all under the rug and hope no one finds out. \nThis is not how any God would prefer life on earth like this to be ok.\nThis is not a religion. \nSorry, my rant about the hypocrisy of religion. \nDefinitely the do as I say, not as I do. \n\u201cThou shall not kill\u201d\u2026except us, especially innocent children!

I prefer to stand on my own two feet or to receive generosity and kindness without my asking for it. I appreciate generosity and kindness given freely that way. What do I do when someone tries to add conditions to their gift? I tell them where to stick it.\n\nI understand that sometimes loans come with conditions for good reasons. If a friend or relative with no budgetary control or no impulse control asks me for help I might hand them up to a hundred pounds and see how long it takes to come back, if at all. If the money doesn't come back and I see they continue to overspend I will only provide further help on condition they spend the money on food, housing, heating, work travel or medicine i.e non gratuitously and that they pay it back at a specified rate. The first hundred is a test or a gift that may or may not come back. Anything I offer thereafter is dependent on what I saw done with the first hundred. Outside of direct money I buy food, drink or take people out. What I don't do is use money and offer help in order to tell people how to live their life; conversely, I don't let other people's struggles dominate my life when I know they've brought those struggles on themselves. Might seem harsh but took many episodes of disadvantaging myself before I toughened up and developed a compromise strategy that allows me to be helpful without harming myself.",

And she was the one who ran the *house*. Her point was \u201cI have no fucking idea what you when you are at college. I have to TRUST that you make good decisions and make it home safe. So why am I on your ass when you come to visit for breaks? Your grandparents did that with curfews and I hated that shit.\u201d  \n\nHer rules were things like \u201ctell me when you are coming home or if you aren\u2019t coming home so I don\u2019t worry. Give me a plausible excuse. Don\u2019t fuck up\u201d. Worked out well. And my dad didn\u2019t care, cause he wasn\u2019t paying for shit and I had a car with a small backseat so I was \u201cboinking\u201d anyone in the car he paid for (his words). Or letting another man drive it. That was another thing he cared about\u2026\n\n**ETA** I feel like I can\u2019t stress enough how much for my father it was the sheer *gall* of paying for a man to bang his daughter. Or paying for another man at all. They couldn\u2019t drive my car. They couldn\u2019t \u201cboink\u201d in my car or dorm room. Certainly not his house. He *balked* at helping me pay for to LIVE WITH A PLATONIC MALE FRIEND as one of 4 roommates in college because he thought it MIGHT be trickery to fund a live in. Oh friend. \n\nHe\u2019s never even offered to pay for a vacation for a partner. My *husband* shares my room because he\u2019s there. Shit, if I\u2019m thinking about it, my husband gets a birthday text only. Never a gift. Our joint Christmas check has only my name on it. He\u2019s probably secretly THRILLED my sister and I kept our maiden names.\n\nHe just can\u2019t live in a world in which he *facilitates with his hard earned cash* a man\u2019s trip to have sex with another woman, much less his daughter.
