Every time she gets in an argument with my BIL she'd take the kids and refuses to bring them back til he apologize to her. He has a medical condition that prevents him from getting outside the house and she is been using that and instead of taking the kids to our aunts house this time she brought them to me since aunt is out of town**.\n\n\nShe asked that I take the kids for 2 days but I refused and pointed out how unacceptable and wrong of her to punish her husband who's already sick and using the fact that he can't drive to go pick HIS KIDS up or at least see them against him (She'd keep them away for days!.)\nShe started talking about how her husband doesn't care about her hurt feelings and how much she does for him. Also how this method has proven to be affective since it got him to recognize his wrong doings and apologize but I replied that he probably was only apologizing just to see the kids. I said it wasn't fair for the kids either but she said they agreed to stay with me and told me to open the door cause they missed me so much.\n\nI refused and said I won't be responsible when BIL finally decides to do something about this and get the cops involved. She yelled she's their mother so the cops won't do a damn thing about it and assured me my BIL would never do that knowing how much she's cared for him but I stood my ground and said I won't be opening the door. Period. She yelled saying I was unsupportive and selfish to keep my nieces and nephew out and refuse to open the door for them.\n\nI suggested she go work her issues out like a rational adult and stop pulling cruel stunts that affects her husband and the kids emotional/mental health. she took offense to that and said I was clearly on my BIL's side. She shamed me infront of the kids for 10+ mins then left. Hours later my dad who lives in another town called shaming & berating me for not opening the door for his grandchildren then insulting my sister and siding against her. I explained my reasons but he said the kids are with my cousin and insisted I go pick them up.\nMy husband said I should've opened the door for the kids and that he could see how dad would be upset with me for not taking the kids in til my sister's conflict with her husband is resolved. He wants me to go pick the kids up but I keep refusing but I feel like unsupportive of my sister.\n\n**more details about my BIL || He has a chronic illness that's gotten worse lately and limited his ability to do most things. To my knowledge he's catheterized, wears a cannula, an a medical device so he can't drive or walk outside the house. My parents never liked him because he was already sick when my sister married him and said she was wasting her life with him but she always say she loves him but I'm not even sure judging by her recent actions**",

Something tells me that the sister is unraveling and God forbid it get any worse. \"Normal argument stuff\" should never be solved by depriving a parent of their kids. That shit is reserved for child abuse or neglect in my book, otherwise you're hurting the kid in an attempt to punish their parent. If the husband is as reliant on help as he sounds then that help should not be coming from his wife. I mean who is at home looking after the husband while his wife throws a hissy fit and leaves with the kids? And exactly how much resentment gets taken out on the husband when the kids aren't there to see it? I'm concerned that she's getting the kids out of the house so they don't witness how she treats their sick dad, and that she goes full tilt when she's alone with him.",

Mention to APS that the kids are being dragged around and also probably seeing their father being berated and neglected, and see what APS thinks about CPS being involved (APS may make that call themselves once they start investigating....these kids are really too young to get  much out of a verbal interview though).  \n\nNTA.  OP has no obligation to open the door to anyone, especially to be the dumping off point to 3 very young kids who evidently are expected to stay for a few days.  No phone call before to ask?  Just entitled belief by sister that OP will take the kids so she can either berate sick husband some more or maybe just go off, leave him alone, and have fun.  This whole family situation is terribly dysfunctional.  And parents aren't helping by \"shaming' OP for not facilitating the situation to continue just because they never liked their SIL.  These are truly rotten parents from the sounds of it. And I think OP knows that her relationship with sister and parents is pretty much gone (and who would want one with these people) so calling in authorities can't make things much worse for her, but it might help her BIL (who by the way, was apparently healthy and acceptable enough for the sister to give her 3 young children before his healthy went bad....so much for \"in sickness and health.\")",

The only thing that stops me from feeling like Sis is a monster is that she is seeing to all the needs of four human beings: her husband and her VERY small children. Right now, her husband is most likely not robust enough to help much with child care, and the children are way too small to help take care of their dad. Sister needs a break. I would see if there are any respite care options available that she can pursue. If not, can family members arrange to lend a hand? Sending them food, helping with shopping, or heading over to watch the kids and chat with BIL while Sis takes a day off with some Me Time would all help reduce the pressure she is under. It sounds like you have enough family members to divide up these tasks so no one is overwhelmed while trying to help the situation.",

              "content": "Op, I am disabled. While disabilities vary greatly, I have been unable to leave the house on my own for close to two years, and when I do get out, it's for medical appointments. I can't help maintain the household right now, and self-care is a struggle. Every day I have to fight to keep my breathing \"okay\", while I try my best to push past the pain and fatigue. \n\nI don't really tell others about this part of my life, and writing it out was harder than I expected. However, I felt I needed to tell you this so you can understand and weigh my response accordingly, knowing I can empathize with your BILs' disability.\n\nOp, you are the only one who is seeing things clearly. Your parents judgment is tainted by their hate for your BIL, and their love for their \"golden child\". They are not reliable witnesses. Between them and your sister, they will make sure to keep any and all family members in line. They will make sure you remain isolated, so that you will give in to doubt as they try to break you down to fall in line, too. You are going to have to decide what kind of person you are, Op, and I won't pretend it will be easy.\n\nYour BIL needs your strength and voice, Op. He is trapped, isolated, and abused; mentally, emotionally, and probably physically (neglect at least). He can't fight, because what would happen to him? Where would he go? I'm sure he already feels like a burden. Deep down, I'd bet he also feels like a failure as a spouse, but moreso as a father. Men often feel like they aren't allowed to ask for help in abusive situations, and being disabled is only going to amplify that. His chronic illness likely saps most of his strength and energy, which creates a type of fatigue a healthy person can't relate to.\n\nThis is why disability advocates are so important.\n\nYour sister has all the power in that house, though she probably feels powerless. She probably started out as a good and loving spouse, but living in a pressure cooker changes people. She carries a ton on her shoulders even when life is good, but add the current state of the world on top of it, and people start to break. When that happens, caring for a disabled person can turn from frustration to hatred, and it gets ugly. It's along the same lines as elder abuse if that helps explain it.\n\nAs problematic as all that is, we then throw three innocent children into the mix. At their ages, they are at the critical formative stages that will have a massive impact on who they will become. A safe, stable, and loving environment are crucial towards a proper foundation. Instead, they are pawns being used to inflict pain and despair on their father. They are constantly removed from their parents home to be left at numerous different places. Your sister is setting up her children to have attachment disorders. \n\nCan you imagine learning that you were a source of pain to your dad? That he would have hurt less if you didn't exist? He hurts, and it's their fault! I'm sure that seems ridiculous, but children always find a way to feel responsible, and they will genuinely think whatever is wrong is their fault.\n\nI know I've written a ton, but we've reached that moment where you need to decide what your role in this will be. Are you willing to stand against your family for the sake of your BIL and nieces/nephews? Someone needs to be their voice. Adult protective services MUST be contacted. You then need to ask them if they will bring in cps, or if you need to make that call separately. Please, don't let this continue and escalate. Somethings gonna give, and it'll be ugly.\n\nI'm sorry this got so long, and I really hope you read it, Op. It took me over two hours to write this while working on my own medical bs. I don't say that for sympathy, I only want to express how important I think your situation is. It's obvious you have a good heart, and I wanted to help explain just how right your perspective is. Does you BIL have family you can talk with? Maybe bring them in as reinforcements? Also, it's going to be hard when your family comes after you, so be ready to block them everywhere. \n\nYou can do this \u2764",

If she's taking away the kids to punish her very ill husband into submission, I'm terrified for him with her as his primary caregiver.\n\nAbusers are typically VERY careful to hide their abusive behavior from the outside world to make themselves look good.  If they ARE witnessed showing any abusive behaviors, it's usually the least disturbing and most mild of their abusive behavior. For example, you might witness an abuser berating their victim in public, but they refrain from physical violence until they are alone with their victim at home. \n\nThink of this behavior of as seeing the tip of a iceberg. \n\nAlso, disabled and/or chronically ill adults are significantly vulnerable and are at much higher risk to be victims of abuse or neglect (best estimates are 4-10x more likely).\n\nIf BIL is as sick as you've said, he is essentially trapped with no way out, with no advocate to help him; he is 100% at your sister's mercy because he is dependent on her to care for even his most basic needs. He is probably terrified of speaking up against your sister because he literally depends on her to keep him alive. What happens if he reaches out for help and your sister finds out?\n\nI guarantee, if you are seeing her punish him in this incredibly abusive way (withholding his children), she is doing much more horrifying things to him behind closed doors.\n\nYou need to call adult protective services, yesterday.

If this has escalated publicly where she's OPENLY \"punishing\" him by using his actual own children, what are the smaller steps behind closed doors that no-one else can see? Does she punish him by withdrawing food, water, support too? Are the kids just an escalation of this? The fact they're being taken away for days makes me think this is a 'big' argument, and I'm concerned about how she handles smaller arguments.\n\nAll this is besides the fact that CHILDREN ARE NOT A PAWN and should never be used as weapons.
