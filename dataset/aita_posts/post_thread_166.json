  "post content": "My wife and I have been married for 3 years now, all though our dating phase and our marriage we have both agreed that we wanted children just not right now.\n\nI am expected to make partner in 2 years at my firm and we\u2019ve said that once that happened we would start our family as the hours and money would be much better. It would allow me to be a better father to our children. As my current role has me working late hours and traveling. Being partner will afford me to not travel, I understand I will still being doing long hours but I will be able to delegate a lot more.\n\nMy wife is on the pill and that suits us both. Recently we had a scare, a second scare within a 6 month period. The first scare she just said that she made a mistake but all was good and it came back negative, I was very much relieved as I thought she would be. My wife looked quite disappointed which I could understand but we agreed it was for the best and that we should stick to our plan. The second and most recent scare had a very different feel to it, an almost deliberateness to it. When I asked if she made a mistake with the pills again she told me to get off her case and accidents happen. Tests came back negative again.\n\nI sat down with my wife and had a talk when everything was calmer and told her I wasn\u2019t blaming her and that these things can happen but 2 so close together was worrying. I suggested I could wear condoms to take the pressure off, she declined as she doesn\u2019t like them, I don\u2019t like them either but I\u2019d rather wear them than risk pregnancy. I even made a joke about getting a vasectomy which we both laughed off.\n\nOut of worry I\u2019ve started to remind her to take the pill before bed and I can see she doesn\u2019t like this and I understand. She\u2019s told me not to do it anymore she finds it controlling. I\u2019ve stopped reminding her but I\u2019ve started to worry about it constantly and it\u2019s put me off wanting to have sex. I did some googling about vasectomies and went down the rabbit hole. What I discovered is that many people had vasectomies and froze their sperm, the more I read the more I felt good about this and thought this would be the perfect solution. My wife wouldn\u2019t have to take the pill and we would have peace of mind. \n\nI brought this up to my wife and she lost it and said that was a terrible idea, I asked her why but she couldn\u2019t give me an answer except that it would be a hassle. I said while yes it would be more hassle, it would give us both total control of when we had children and we wouldn\u2019t need to worry about BC ever again. My wife said I was behaving like I don\u2019t trust her and that I should trust her to take care of it. I just told her this makes the most sense and that this is what I wanted to do and that I would book an appointment as soon as I could. \n\nMy wife has been angry with me and refuses to come to the appointment saying that I\u2019m being selfish and that this choice should be made together.\n\nAITA here for wanting this and potentially going through with this?",

Instead of trying to address the root of the problem, OP is making a unilateral decision that will affect both of them. While it is his body, he agrees that they both want children in a few years \u2014 so his decision affects both of them. \n\nWhy is OP getting a vasectomy? Because he's so anxious about whether his wife is taking her BC. Why is he anxious? Because communication has broken down and he no longer trusts her. I'm not saying that it's anyone's fault necessarily, but something is very wrong with their relationship and getting a vasectomy is not going to solve it. If he can't trust his wife not to get \"accidentally\" pregnant then the relationship is on thin ice. \n\nOP - you're right that it's your body. But also, if you want to remain married to your wife, she's right that it ought to be a joint decision, given that it affects your joint plans for the future. And to be honest, if I was in her shoes I wouldn't exactly be excited about undergoing artificial insemination when there are so many other solutions. Clearly she's got some issues too (like rejecting condoms), but your relationship seems dysfunctional from both sides. If you want your marriage to work, couples counseling is probably needed.\n\nAlso, I have to say, I don't think it's necessarily incriminating that a) she's had several scares, and b) she seemed sad she wasn't pregnant. I'm in absolutely no position to have children but despite using multiple methods of BC I've had scares, and for some of them started seriously considering what I'd do. While I wasn't precisely sad when I turned out to not be pregnant, I also wasn't planning on getting an abortion \u2014 and if I'd been in an actual stable relationship of many years, I think I would've actually started getting pretty excited at the possibility (although having a kid is of course a daunting prospect, especially when unplanned).",

I would be pissed if a missed period made my spouse stop trusting me and start treating me like a child.\n\nI do agree with other posters that they need couple's counseling. There has been a total collapse of communication on both sides. He said their whole relationship they agreed it wasn't the right time to have kids NOW but it isn't clear how long that actually has been going on. Had he expected to make more money right out of school? What if he doesn't make partner? For most people the time will never be perfect, and a vasectomy just seems like over kill.",

When I thought more about it, though, protesting your boyfriend micromanaging you about your pills when you\u2019ve taken them mostly without issue for years, if not decades; not wanting to use condoms when you\u2019re in a long-term monogamous relationship; and noting want your boyfriend to have a vasectomy when you two planned to have children soon... all that seems like normal behaviour. \n\nThe reason OP\u2019s narrative is compelling is because is because OP\u2019s wife had two scares where she was disappointed she didn\u2019t have a child. As you\u2019ll note in other posts here, neither the two scares (missed periods are common), nor the fact that she\u2019s disappointed she\u2019s not actually pregnant is unusual behaviour for a woman didn\u2019t plan to have kids now but who was gearing up have kids in the foreseeable future. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, nor being touchy about the situation because you know your husband feels differently. \n\nIn short, there is nothing resembling factual evidence that OP\u2019s wife is guilty of the crime you\u2019re accusing her of. I do think the evidence can be counted suggestive \u2014it\u2019s definitely possible that OP\u2019s wife could be guilty of what you\u2019re accusing her of doing, there\u2019s nothing in OP\u2019s story that makes her guilt even likely. I agree with you that OP should take extra precautions, and is rightly troubled, but tell me this is worth ruining a marriage for.

Maybe take sex off the table until they find a second form of birth control that works for them both. They could consult a doctor about the countless other possibilities \u2014shots, iud, etc.\u2014that are less drastic than \u201cvasectomy appointment asap\u201d.",

But if I had too many intentional scares, I wouldn't put it past my partner to think something is wrong with my birth control and that different avenues need to be taken into account.

For OP to assume she was lying and trying to trick him is a BIG indication that their relationship is not a stable and healthy relationship. Yes, some people do lie...but if you're *assuming* your partner is a liar, your relationship is already a dumpster fire of a marriage.\n\nGetting a vasectomy in reaction to a presumed lie with no evidence will only make things worse. If OP wants one regardless, fine, it's his choice - but he shouldn't think it will fix anything. At best, it will subject his wife to an entirely unnecessary, unpleasant, and highly invasive medical procedure. At worst, it will be a dealbreaker and he'll be divorced and sterilized instead of just divorced. And this could easily be a dealbreaker because if OP is so ready to assume she lied, she's probably equally ready to assume OP is lying now and will never want kids. \n\nThe problem isn't the cost, AND the problem isn't that OP isn't certain why there were pregnancy scares. The problem is that their relationship is completely fucked up, and they need to examine their dynamic and if they (a) can fix it or (b) want to stay together before OP starts making decisions about surgery that will affect both their futures.",

But let's see.\n\nAssuming total candor, I would be very suspicious myself. My read is that she wants a kid sooner than you. You don't mention ages. Likelihood of implantation, successful pregnancy, and child not afflicted by various diseases increases with age, particularly age of the woman. Partner track is usually, what - 5-10 years, depending (I assume lawyer) and you're almost there.\n\nA lot depends on your ages. If it's a question of having a kid at 30 rather than 32, her concern is more of a want. If it's 40 vs. 42, it's a more significant difference.\n\nYou're talking about a potentially reversible but usually permanent procedure, combined with freezing sperm, as a roundabout way to counter a suspicion - not entirely unreasonable - that she is not actually taking these pills in order to have a kid earlier than agreed.\n\nPerhaps I'll say this: ESH if you don't talk about other things first. Birth control pills have a failure rate a good deal above many other methods of birth control, like IUDs or the implantable kind of hormone-release product.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/index.htm#:\\~:text=Typical%20use%20failure%20rate%3A%204%25.&text=Combined%20oral%20contraceptives%E2%80%94Also%20called,is%20prescribed%20by%20a%20doctor.](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/index.htm#:~:text=Typical%20use%20failure%20rate%3A%204%25.&text=Combined%20oral%20contraceptives%E2%80%94Also%20called,is%20prescribed%20by%20a%20doctor.)\n\nIf she absolutely refuses everything but continuing to take the pill despite two accidents, I suppose it must ultimately be NTA because it's your body. But it will have ripple effects on the marriage, at the least.\n\nIf she agrees she does not want a child right now, I do not see a great reason not to get an IUD or implant. Those are \\~0.01% failure rate. Pills vary, up to 7% failure rate (I could have sworn it was lower failure rate). The probability of two things with a 7% probability happening is quite a bit lower. (I want to say 0.49%). Either way, IUDs and the long-release implanted hormones are much better in general.\n\nI have no idea if you can tailor implanted hormones so that they last 2 years specifically, but IUDs can be removed at wish by the doc as far as I know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimply going to a vasectomy without fighting all that out would be pretty *esh*, but then I don't know what the rates are with use of frozen sperm for things like implantation failure, any potential increase in risk of genetic defect, etc.\n\nAnd I don't know your ages.",

He even seemed like he\u2019d settle for just being allowed to remind her once a day about the pill. This post completely ignores the fact that his wife his being completely uncooperative in giving OP any control over this after there have been two scares back to back. Guys have just as much right to make sure there aren\u2019t any unwanted pregnancies and his wife is shutting down any ability for him to do that. There\u2019s only 3 unilateral options he has to control this himself, no sex for two years/divorce/vasectomy. None of them are great for his relationship. \n\nHonestly, it\u2019s super fucking weak for his wife to be against condoms for extra security on birth control because she doesn\u2019t like how they feel, if you refuse to compromise on something like this then yeah, people will do extreme and stupid shit.",
