  "post content": "My husband rented his aunts home before we got married. He signed a month to month lease when he moved in. I moved in with him after our marriage because the rent was super cheap. \nMy parents recently came to me asking if they could park their RV at our home.\nI didn\u2019t see a problem with this. Our yards are really big and there is space.\nBecause of city ordinance the RV has to be parked in the back yard. There was no RV gate in the fence. My husband went to his aunt and asked if we could install a rv gate? His aunt said no. My husband relayed the message to me and my parents seemed upset when I told them. 2 days ago. I came home from work and saw that my dad had a construction crew at our home and had removed part of the fence for the gate. There was a apple tree in the way. They couldn\u2019t fit the RV in the yard. My husband angry told my dad not to continue and that they needed to repair the fence.\nAt this point I felt like it was pointless. The fence guys already built the columns for the gate. It would cost a lot more money to rebuild the fence. I told my dad to finish the job but make sure it was left super clean. That it looked nice. I planned on talking to the aunt later and explain what happened.\nWhat I didn\u2019t know was my dad told the guys to remove the tree. \nMy husbands aunt came by and saw the tree cut down and started to cry. She has refused to talk to my dad or me. When my husband came home he found a 30 day notice on our door.\nTerminating our lease. He tried to call his aunt and she didn\u2019t answer the phone. He then called my MIL and she went to talk to our aunt.\nLater I got several messages calling me an A for cutting down the aunts late husbands tree. I had no idea he planted the tree. Now my husband and his whole family are really angry at me. I never told them to remove the tree. I feel like I am being thrown under the bus here. Am I the A here?",

How stupid and selfish of them. Everyone is the AH besides your husband, his aunt and family. The Aunt can hire a lawyer and sue your parents and the company who did it without her permission. And honestly I hope she does\n\n\n\nEdited to add: Thanks for all the awards!!",

Those trees have sheltered us in their boughs for decades, they've grown with us over three generations, provided tasty summer treats, and endless supplies of pecans for pies in the fall. But what makes them so special is the fact that each tree was planted for us by our beloved (and since departed) kin. When we suddenly lost my mother a few years ago, I would spend the days when I missed her the most hiding in the branches of her 25 year old magnolia, crying like a child and hugging the tree as if it were her. It sounds ridiculous, but that tree kept me grounded during those first awful months without her. Those trees are unquestionably considered to be members of our family, and my *entire* family would absolutely raise hell against anyone who would seek to harm a single one of them.

May his memory always be a blessing. \n\nWhat you describe about the power of the scent of your husband\u2019s shirt totally changed my perspective about the tree cloning. I had been thinking that cloning could be a viable solution  because at least that way the specific tree the aunt\u2019s husband planted survives. It would look different but still be a superior replacement versus an entirely new tree that matched the age and size of the original. But I realized that your comparison cuts even closer to the bone, because a cloned tree would be like if someone just came over one day while you were out and washed all your husband\u2019s things. Sure, you\u2019d still have the same physical items of clothing that he actually wore, but there\u2019s truly no way to replace or restore the olfactory aspect of their sentimentality. \n\nThe aunt has irrevocably lost the actual tree that her husband put in the ground with his own hands and that they and she tended to and watched grow over the years. Having something of the original is better than nothing, but it can\u2019t ever be the way it was because some AH decided they knew better. It doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest that AH OP and her AH father didn\u2019t know the full story of the tree\u2019s importance, because they *did* know it *wasn\u2019t* their property *and* that the owner had already said no to the whole project in the first place. Not every mistake can be repaired and that\u2019s one very good reason why we should respect the boundaries other people set for their stuff.",
