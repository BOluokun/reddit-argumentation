  "post content": "So my husband (39m) is friends and coworkers with both people. He\u2019s kept the super awkward friendship with, we\u2019ll call him frank (42m), by not talking about the situation. \n\nThe situation is frank hooked up with (40f) Marlene, and she ended up pregnant. Now he\u2019s taken her to court to try and get out of child support. His side being that she told him she couldn\u2019t get pregnant after he said he didn\u2019t want kids. \n\nHusband has tried to stay neutral on both sides by not talking about it to either side. But at home it hurts him because we\u2019ve been trying for a kid for 3 years and have been working through some fertility issues. And his friend gets someone pregnant like it\u2019s nothing, and then wants nothing to do with it. So that really pisses me off. \n\nSo Frank ended up being at the same ballgame as us. Hubby said he wants us to come hang out. I said I wasn\u2019t really interested in hanging out with a person like that. One thing led to another and we\u2019re hanging out together. Ultimately after the game is over and we\u2019re all b.s.ing, I end up calling him out for it being his responsibility as an adult. He ends the conversation by saying he has had to pay this whole time. I walked away but had to go back and defend my husband but he wants to hear none of that. Truth hurts. Then franks side piece gets involved and we have to leave before I get us kicked out. \nAith for even talking about it? Maybe different place different time but I had no intention of seeing him again. Also he brought it up because he said we\u2019re all family, I said no, he asked why, I said you know why\u2026 the rest is history.\n\nEdit;\n\nY\u2019all are right, ESH. I\u2019m new to Reddit and had to look up what that means. But I love it cause it\u2019s true.\n\nI never should have handled it the way I did. IATA for that. And I am taking a lot out on him for our infertility issues.\n\nShitty thing is, we were all friends before this. My husband worked with both of them. And my coworker is her sister. So we\u2019ve all hung out together multiple times. The last time was actually at a baseball game(I see a theme here), When she was newly pregnant and he was still in it as a wanting to be the kids father. She was so excited because she mentioned then that she didn\u2019t think she could get pregnant. So it was her understanding that she couldn\u2019t. Wether is was medically confirmed or not I don\u2019t know. I do know first hand it costs a lot of money to find out.\n\nBut I never got his side of the story until last night. He said that when they hooked up, both by mutual agreement, he wrapped it up the first few times. Then I guess things progressed and they didn\u2019t want to use protection. He told her he didn\u2019t want kids and she said she couldn\u2019t have them. I don\u2019t think either of them lied. I think they both believe their sides. I honestly don\u2019t believe it was entrapment because that\u2019s not the kind of person she is. But I guess there are crazier things.\n\nI\u2019m the end its a lot messier than what my husband told me. That was one reason I wanted to talk to frank. But it sucks that it turned out the way it did because now their baby is the one who will suffer and needs support. He gave up his rights because he does not want to have to pay.\n\nFor those that said he should get out of it because he said before he didn\u2019t want kids I get that point. But In the end there\u2019s a kid now and while he can give up his rights and not have anything to do with the kid he still needs to be held accountable by financially supporting it. It sucks but it takes two to tango and is was his swimmers that resulted in a child, wanted or not. He wasn\u2019t raped. And In the beginning he wanted to make it work. He was going to be the father. I\u2019m not sure what changed.\n\nHTA for not being a freakin adult and taking responsibility financially. And acting like it\u2019s no big deal. STA for even saying that, if she didn\u2019t know for sure. HubbyITA for not having a conversation like this with Frank in the first place. And for putting me in that position when he knew I didn\u2019t want to go.\n\nAnd ITA for letting it get to me and not being able to control myself. Frank brought it up because he asked why I didn\u2019t want to hang out. I just hate the position this puts my husband in. Now he feels like he has to pick sides and it\u2019s torn two friendships apart. And I made it even worse last night. And I think thing that hurts him is Frank acts like nothing happened and it\u2019s no big deal and he doesn\u2019t care about my husband feelings or situation at all. Stupid all around. And ESH. Thanks everyone",

However, the situation is really none of your concern, regardless if you know about it, and honestly it sounds like some of your feelings are stemming from jealousy/resentment because of your own fertility issues and while I do sympathize with you on that, it's not the friends fault that you and your husband are having these difficulties.

Lots of people are told that they are infertile and believe that it means it is impossible to get pregnant, conflating it with *sterility*. Both refer to a broad spectrum of conditions that can affect reproduction, but infertility usually describes being unable to conceive after a year of trying and/or being highly unlikely to conceive for any number of reasons. Plenty of people who've been told or diagnosed as infertile have gotten pregnant, even if it is not statistically common or difficult without medical intervention.

Two adults hooked up and caused a surprise pregnancy despite their preconceptions, they're as responsible as two teenagers who whole-heartedly but mistakenly believed the \"pull out method was fool proof\".\n\nIf this man is so against taking responsibility for a child - he certainly could have taken more precaution - but it's no more his fault than it is hers.\n\nWomen do have the additional choice of ending a pregnancy - but that's because they have the additional task of bearing the child. It's a technical reality of the situation - but abortion still isn't a procedure that's recommended. Men and women have equal choice at the most critical stage - when they participate in sex that causes a pregnancy - and again it's why society puts the onus of responsibility on both parents at conception.\n\nIndividual circumstances vary - but I'd say the reality of most fathers being less effected physically and economically by parenthood is a technicality that helps balance it out - along with their tendency to be less attached to and more prone to abandoning their children (both planned and unplanned).",
