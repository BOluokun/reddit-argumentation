  "post content": "My sister (35f) is getting married this fall. When she got engaged she asked me (30f) to be a bridesmaid approximately a year ago. Recently she gave out her bridesmaid proposal boxes and I did not receive one. I was cut out of the wedding party. I never said anything because personally I feel like it would come across selfish and if she selected people to be apart of her day then so be it. I was hurt though. \n\nA little backstory, my sister and I have history. She has done some very wicked things to me. As example she had a baby when I was 15 YO and told me if I babysat for her everyday after school she would gift me her old car on my 16th bday. Fast forward after babysitting for 6+ hours every day for a year, she sold that car and kept the money and told me to get over it. \n\nMy sister has excluded me from all wedding activities such as dress shopping etc but yet my SIL/Mom/Grandma etc have all been invited. \n\nNow back to the wedding- I recently got the invitation and scanned the QR code to go to her wedding site. Where I discovered that I was excluded from a plus one as well and cannot bring my boyfriend of 2 years. If I were to go to this wedding that I was already de-bridesmaided, I would also have to attend alone. I decided I honestly did not want to go and told my mother. She\u2019s calling me the a hole telling me that I\u2019m going to regret this and it\u2019s ridiculous to not attend over some bad history and \u201cyour boyfriend not being allowed to come\u201d. For reference it wasn\u2019t about the plus one, it was just my final straw. \n\nAITA or am I justified in my decision?",

There's a drainage pipe nearby.  Now and then some barely drinkable water drips out of it.  It's enough to keep the weed alive.  People come out back to smoke sometimes and flick their cigarette butts in the weed's general direction.  And sometimes they call it \"you poor damn thing, what are you doing here?\"  It's something.  The weed isn't entirely alone.\n\nSomebody walking along the access road notices the weed.  They come back with a bucket and a spade and dig it up.  The weed is terrified.  Everything familiar is being torn away!  Where is it going?  What's going to happen?\n\nThe weed finds itself replanted in a green lawn beside a clear running stream.  Everything is so strange.  There are ducks instead of trucks.  Soil instead of dust.  A neat little picket fence around it, instead of the gray rim of the ditch.  Strangers wander past.  Sometimes the weed sees people from the factory, but they never even look in the weed's direction.\n\nBut...\n\nA winter and a summer, and that weed is a springing sapling, tendrils uncurling, leaves abounding.  A few more years go by, and the weed has become a laburnum tree whose golden chains of flowers sway in the breeze.  Some sour-faced people resent it for showing by its mere existence that there is life beyond the factory.  But others come to rest in its shade, and admire its resilience.  All it needed was good water and soil, a place free from poisons and careless stamping boots.\n\nThe secret to recovery, my therapist told me, is realizing that you are the weed *and you are also the gardener.*  You can take *yourself* to a better place.  You don't have to stay where you were planted.  You may well find a place much better, where you can flourish.",

OP is 30 y/o and is just now learning how to set boundaries and not be a punching bag for her family, and her conviction is tenuous at best right now. Initiating conflict with her family will:\n\n- allow Mom, Sis, and whoever else to cry victim to the rest of the extended family. OP says family is important to her. While she's testing the idea of going LC/NC with her immediate family, being alienated from even her extended family might be too much for her. Sometimes it's nice to have just one person on your side. Mom and Sis will do their best to make sure that doesn't happen. OP shouldn't give her family any ammunition against her.\n\n- allow Mom to guilt trip OP into removing those boundaries again.  OP is in a vulnerable state right now. She's flexing her independence and starting to rebel against the status quo of her being the scapegoat in the family. Those that benefited from that dynamic will not give up quietly. \n\n- put a damper on OPs whole trip. She already feels bad enough about the current issue so much that she posted on AITA asking if she was wrong. She'll just be thinking about how her mother yelled/ screamed/ cried/ guilted/ raged/ etc at her the rest of the trip. Did she do the right thing? Should she go back? Things like that.\n\nThe worst thing someone can do to a narcissist is ignore them. I'm not sure if Mom and Sis are narcissists or just shitty people in general, but either way just ignoring them would be the best course of action. Why should they get to live rent-free in OPs head? That's not fair to OP, her mental, or her physical health.\n\nI know it sounds cathartic to be able to \"stick it to\" Mom and Sis and rub it in their faces and leave them angry and frustrated while OP lives her best life without them, but I don't think that would work out that way right now. Maybe in a couple of years. But right now, OP just needs to cut all contact and focus on putting distance from her family.\n\nEdit: adjusted the first word to \"no\" because my original wording might have counted as my vote \ud83d\ude02",
