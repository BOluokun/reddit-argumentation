He's made it clear he is just not interested in spending time with his nephew, keeps saying that the reason for that is that he's actually \"child free\". for so many emergencies he has turned me and my wife away when we begged him to watch our son  and he didn't even budge or apologize for his attitude.\n\n\nit all came to head a couple of days ago, I had a work meeting while my wife was out of town and my inlaws were attending a wedding so no one was free to watch my son except for my BIL. I showed up to his place and told him I was desperate for help and needed him to just watch my son for 2 hours. he refused, even suggested I take him with me to work but that's not a good suggestion. I begged him and he just said no. I had enough I confronted him and asked why? does he not like his nephew and he threw that \"no it's just that I'm child free\" excuse which made me lose it. I told him to just stop because it's cringe of him to keep saying that and use it as an excuse to be unsupportive of me and his sister and cold towards his nephew. I told him he should really do better and stop being so negative but he got mad and said I had no right to disrespect his lifestyle/choices but it's the attitude that gets me. we had a exchange of words where he said my son isn't his responsibility whatsoever then I left.\n\n\nhe complained to my inlaws and they \"called me out\" for disrespecting their son and treating him like that. They insisted that he's not responsible for my son and I shouldn't expect so much from him then guilt him about it. they wanted me to apologize and my wife said I should but he was about as helpful and supportive as a rock so, I decided I will take my time before I consider apologizing.\n\n\nAITA?",

We had a VP of a fortune 500 company do an All Hands with his dog losing its mind and he's like \"Uh, sorry.\" I've also seen lots of kids on laps during Zoom calls.

People like OP can't fathom how everyone else isn't just falling all over themselves to have/watch/interact with/coo over/take care of babies and kids, because they're SO precious, and anyone who doesn't think so is a cold, hateful person.\n\nI have no kids, and I'm the only woman in my family to not have kids. For 20+ years, there was this almost culty propaganda in my family about getting me to interact with and care for all the other kids, I guess in hopes of triggering my certainly-latent parental instincts. \"Here, \\_Kay\\_Tee\\_, little Baby needs a diaper change!\" \"Can you just keep an eye on the kids in the pool for five minutes?\" When I'd point out that I don't want to, it's not my responsibility, and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable, they'd start with the same kind of entitled rubbish: \"You can't spend ONE HOUR with your own nephew?! You're so selfish! I have to take care of them all the time and you can't do this one little thing? I never knew you were so cold. But Niece LOVES spending time with you- Oh, now she's crying. Great.\"\n\nThis is why OP's BIL has to keep saying \"child-free.\" Like others have mentioned, he does not want to be responsible for the care of a child. That, in fact, is one of the LEAST selfish things a person can do.",
