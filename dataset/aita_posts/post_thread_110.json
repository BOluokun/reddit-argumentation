  "post content": "I'm the mother of a 17 year old girl. The legal drinking age where we live is 18 but the average age kids start drinking is 13, usually in a field somewhere with gut rotting cider and a parent at home worried sick about where the child is. My daughter never did this, but she did start drinking in controlled environments (she looks significantly older than what she is so being asked for ID has never been an issue) like pubs and at home or at friends houses when she was 15.\n\nI'm pretty laid back when it comes to rules like that, mostly because my parents were extremely strict and got mad at me for everything. My rules on substances are no hard drugs, no aftershock and no tequila. But I don't get mad if my daughter tells me she's expiremented with certain things. I've created a safe space for my daughter, she tells me pretty much everything and I respect her boundaries and privacy.\n\nI've raised a very responsible young adult and I'm extremely proud of her and glad for the relationship we've got. The problem is with her father. He's American and wasn't in her life much until last march when he came to visit his parents in my country and ended up being trapped here and decided to move here permanently. She was 16 at the time. \n\nHe called over last Friday night completely unannounced, when myself and my daughter were having a few drinks with my partner and one of her friends and he was absolutely appalled at the sight of our daughter having a beer. He stormed out and on Saturday morning, I got a text saying that he was going to contact child services about this and that it was completely wrong of me to allow this and participate with her.\n\nI told him my daughter having a few drinks at home is not actually illegal here and technically there's no minimum drinking age when supervised by a parent. I also reminded him he's not her legal guardian and wasn't in her life from the ages of 2 to 16 so he doesn't get much of a say.\n\nNeedless to say, he thinks I'm a massive a-hole for allowing my daughter to drink alcohol under the legal age. AITA?",

If you take the mystery away, teach them safety and responsibility from the get go you\u2019re far more likely to end up with adults who know how to drink responsibility. \n\nGranted that\u2019s not in every single case some folks are just wired to overindulge, not knowing when to stop. It\u2019s also no to say allow your teenagers to go on benders every other weekend. I\u2019m just saying giving them a safe space knowing they can come to you for anything leads for a much healthier parent/child relationship and a lower probability of substance and alcohol abuse problems.",

This is especially a problem for people whose brains have not yet finished myelanation, which finishes around 25 years old. As such, teenagers are especially susceptible to alcohol addiction and should be restricted to consumption at levels well bellow what would be safe and responsible for an adult. \n\nOf course, since teenagers are likely to drink whether you \"let\" them or not (as you pointed out), consumption of alcohol under responsible adult supervision is the best damage mitigation option.

I live in a state with absolutely no drinking under 21 unless you are calling EMS for another teen who is in need of medical assistance due to drinking, wild. No drinking until you're 21 was highly pushed on all teens in high school. I remember a police officer/guest speaker coming in to explain how if you are at a party and standing within 6ft of a drink you would be charged with underage drinking, essentially ruining your life according to him. Turned me off of alcohol to the point where having a sit down dinner at home to try my first drink the night before, yes before, I turned 21 was anxiety provoking. Is that a healthy relationship with alcohol? Idk, I never drank more than 2 drinks in one night and have stayed away from other mind altering substances too.\n\nNow I don't drink at all out of choice, very low tolerance and don't like feeling drunk after a few sips, but I'm not offended by other's drinking. As long as they are being responsible about it, not driving or jumping off the roof (a coworker broke her pelvis doing that), it doesn't bother me. I do get excluded from talks about alcohol because people assume I'm a prude about it, had someone apologize for sending me a pic of a fancy drink they made. Its weird the division we make about these things. \n\nI wish we lived in a different state or could reasonably expect to move somewhere that I could comfortably teach my kid that maxing out on alcohol the night you turn 21 is not needed.
