  "post content": "Ive been doing a program at my school which is called \u201cthe marine challenge\u201d which is basically a fitness program. My parents asked if I wanted to do a program at Marine Military Academy over the summer and I said sure, thinking it was more of the same.\n\nBut I looked up videos of it, and while it seems fun, they make all campers buzz their hair off. I have long hair right now. I told my mom I changed my mind but she said she already put down the deposit and I am going. She asked why I didn\u2019t want to go and I said I didn\u2019t know they\u2019d be shaving my head. She said it\u2019s just a haircut, and it\u2019s selfish to now back out and that I should have looked it up before saying yes.\n\nI guess in a lot of ways she\u2019s right does that make me the a hole?",

Sounds like the mom and OP should have had more of a discussion about what this camp entails before mom handed over the money. From the post, it sounds like the mom was aware of this when she signed OP up, and surely she knows that a teenager would have an opinion about their long hair being shaved off?\n\nSo I kind of think mom is more at fault here for not communicating about the expectations of the camp. Still, offering to pay back the deposit might be the most diplomatic way for OP to back out of the camp.\n\nTbh I find the idea of sending your child to a military camp where they shave off children's hair quite disturbing, and maybe that's biasing my judgment here.",

And if your family is trying to pressure you into Marine academy programs, they may well try to pressure you into actually enlisting. If that\u2019s something you want to go into fully informed because YOU want to, then that\u2019s your choice to make, but if not, I am BEGGING you not to do it. \n\nWhy?

Could he kill someone with a knife in hand-to hand combat? Almost certainly. But he\u2019s also 50 and about to enter rehab again after a 12-day alcohol bender that nearly killed him (it would\u2019ve had I not found him near death and sent his ass to detox), and the trauma he experienced in boot camp is part of the reason. \n\nThe military\u2019s goal is to make excellent SOLDIERS\u2014 not healthy, whole human beings. The two are very often incompatible. If you are okay with this, then it\u2019s not my business.

If this institution is not right for you and you enlist for the wrong reasons, it could literally still be jeopardizing your safety, life, and marriage at age 50. \n\nBe well.",
