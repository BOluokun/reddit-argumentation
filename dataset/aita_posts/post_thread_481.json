  "post content": "My husband works 4 days a week, 10 hours a day but once a month he has to work the weekend. I work from home, care for the house and our 2 kids. Husband goes to the gym 3-4 times a week for 2 hours each time. On the other days he takes the dog and goes for a run, usually an hour to 90 minutes. I workout at home when the kids are at school or asleep. Today happens to be a weekend day that husband had to work. He comes home, changes clothes and left for the gym, he will be gone for about 2.5 hours. This means that he will get back about bedtime for the kids. Would I be the a-hole if I asked him not to go to the gym after working all day on the weekends anymore? \n\nDuring the week I don't care but after leaving me to care for the kids all day with no break, I find it a bit unfair that he comes home, gets the kids and dog all riled up and leaves 5 min later. I'm left to deal with them being upset that Dad only spent 5 minutes here and almost none of it with them. I haven't had 2 minutes to myself all day and I just want to be able to sit down without having to break up an arguement, get someone food or do for someone else. Just writing this post has taken me almost an hour because I can only write a sentence at a time.",
