  "post content": "I work as a lifeguard at a waterpark and part of my job includes managing the top of the waterslides. I\u2019m to make sure no one does anything dangerous like going face first, cramming too many people on one innertube, etc. I\u2019m also instructed to ask anyone who looks like they could be over the weight limit\u2013250 pounds\u2013to weigh themselves on our scale, and deny them entry if they refuse. I\u2019m not super comfortable with this, but it\u2019s much better than risking people\u2019s safety.\n\nHere lies the problem: I lift weights, and for this reason I am very dense\u2013I weigh 185 pounds but somehow wear a size 6. Most of my friends also lift and have similar body compositions to me. For this reason I have trouble estimating how much someone actually weighs.\n\nThis problem presented itself last weekend when an overweight teenage girl wanted to ride the slide. She most likely wasn\u2019t over 250 pounds, but I couldn\u2019t be certain. I\u2019ve gotten better at estimating weights but my supervisor says if there\u2019s any chance they\u2019re over 250 to weigh them, so I approached her gently and asked her to please get on the scale.\u00a0\n\nShe met me with a snarky teenager attitude and said \u201cwhat if I refuse?\u201d She was with a group of teenagers, some of whom were giggling.\n\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t be allowed on the slide,\u201d I said matter-of-factly.\n\nShe rolled her eyes and got on the scale, and her weight wasn\u2019t even close to 250 so I felt kind of bad. She then said \u201cSee?\u201d and went along with her friends.\n\nAlthough she gave me attitude I could tell she was embarrassed. Her face was red as she went back to her friends, who were all thin. I asked my supervisor how he would have handled the situation and he said I did the right thing, that it\u2019s better to hurt someone\u2019s feelings than break someone\u2019s bones.\n\nHowever, yesterday I was called into the office of the owner of the waterpark. She told me she received an angry email from a parent about how I embarrassed their child in front of her friends. I explained to her that I was just following protocol and she asked me how much the girl actually weighed. I gave her the answer and she laughed at me and told me I could never get a job as a weight guesser at a carnival and that I need to do my job better. My supervisor is backing me up and saying I was doing what he has required me to do. I\u2019m thankful for his support but honestly this whole situation is making me feel like an a\\*\\*hole. I know teenage girls are a particularly vulnerable population, as I was a teenage girl not too long ago, and I could have possibly handled that situation with more care. But at the same time safety is my first priority. Does that make me the a\\*\\*hole?",

Do you have any idea what that could do to someone\u2019s psyche? Y\u2019all need to change that policy ASAP. \n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a way you could bypass legal issues by putting up signs about weight risk around the slide. If someone is too heavy and gets hurt, it\u2019s their own fault. Public humiliation is not the answer here",

There's also usually scales not at the top of the slides that are not \"operated\" by attendants so people can check themselves and there are signs before you get in line with the weight limits (besides on websites before you even get to the park).   The attendants are usually quite good about being discreet about it.  The only time I've ever noticed someone being turned away is because the rider throws a big fit and in those cases, I don't feel sorry for them.  It's not like the weight limit is a secret and I highly doubt they didn't know they were at least close.  It can't feel good, I'm sure, but your life is more important than your ego, you know?  Why bring more attention to yourself?  The rider in this story could have just stepped on quickly, OO would have said it sorry and it would have been over, but the rider drew more attention to herself being difficult about it.",

Beacuse even you think the overweight people \"have it coming\" for lying about or being in denial about their weight and it's on them if they get hurt or die, they could cause strain or damage to the ride that hurts or kills someone else. So it's  not even their risk to take, it's a danger to all park goers if the ride is strained or damaged and perhaps no longer safe.",
