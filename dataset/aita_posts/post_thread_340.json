  "post content": "I 47m have a 22 year old daughter. She\u2019s in college and lives on campus. I agreed to help her make car payments, since she was in school. \n\nI was recently informed by a young man I work with that my daughter strips at a club about 40 minutes away. I confronted her on this and she said she  didn\u2019t plan to do it after she graduated, and she needed some money. I told her then work at McDonalds, not use her body.\n\nWe got into an argument, and i asked her to quit stripping and get a decent job then. She refused and said stripping was easy money, so basically I said there was no need for me to pay her car payment anymore since she is making money so easily. She got upset and said that wasn\u2019t fair, and that she doesn\u2019t make enough for that. I told her to figure it out.\n\nShe told my wife about what happened, and my wife is upset by her job of choice but says it\u2019s unfair for me to stop supporting her so suddenly over an argument. I think it\u2019s perfectly fair, it\u2019s my money and my decision when to cut it off.",

They wind up falling behind in school or lose their real dream due to being unable to even get up during daylight hours. Then theres the creeps that follow you to your car, stalk you , harass you, and in some really bad cases, kill you. No problem with any woman doing this job, as long as they can maintain the discipline and not fall off a cliff of drinking , drug abuse. And alot of cases actual real prostitution.

They basically quiet fired me by drastically cutting my hours, i ended up leaving one night after seeing how they'd drastically cut my hours and doctored it to look like I'd put in for days that I didn't, i talked to my GM about it he refused to change it saying if i was that sick i shouldnt be working anyway (which i wouldnt have even had a problem had they just let me fucking sip a glass of water, followed my request for allergy accommodations when i asked for dishwashing gloves, and stopped leaving me alone during several hour long rushes aside from occasional flareups my symptoms are normally manageable) this mixed with the sexual harassment conversation (oh btw i also supplied the evidence for the minors case against that manager ) was my breaking point. I had a breakdown, called my boyfriend, and he just told me to leave. The dude who harassed me wasn't even the only creep they hired and refused to deal with. That place is horrible, and i warn everyone against it if they can help it.\n\nYeah, i never got people who use that, im very pro not glorifying sex work and talking about the possible dangers. it's important to talk about the good and the bad, but \"well guys will get creepy if you do it\" just comes off like victim blaming to me. Guys are always gonna be creepy, predatory, and dangerous when you're in a position where you can't really tell them to screw off because the kind of dudes who do that stuff will always flock to situations where they know they have power and the excuse for why its your fault always changes \"well maybe you shouldn't be so nice\" i could get fired if im not nice im all alone up here what if he gets violent i have to be nice, \"you have to tell them no/to stop and be assertive\" when its your boss or manager youre in a position where they can retaliate against you, \"why didnt you tell someone, just refuse to serve them\" how am i supposed to do that when management doesnt care and we are always understaffed, \"well you shouldnt be so dressed up for work\" how is scratch grey cotton shirt ive been sweating in for hour sexy?

At a decent club, the girls just have to give the bouncer the signal, and whoever is harassing them or crossing the line is out of there. I have friends that have worked as dancers, bouncers, waitresses, and bartenders at strip clubs, and they all look out for each other and make sure the customers are showing respect. There\u2019s way more respect there from customers than in fast food places. I personally don\u2019t get the big problem people have with dancers either. It\u2019s a great way to embrace your body, express yourself, and make good money while doing it. More power to any girl who has the confidence to willingly do that!",
