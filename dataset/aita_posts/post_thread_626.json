  "post content": "For context we are in a 6 year relationship, not married.\n\n\nMy wife is 8 months pregnant and driving me insane. Before she was pregnant we didn\u2019t have many issues but now, anything I do isn\u2019t good enough. My cooking is shit, I don\u2019t do laundry correctly, I don\u2019t clean well enough/miss too many spots. \n\n\nThe last straw was my wife saying my foot message wasn\u2019t good enough. Since she told me that (9 days ago) I have been responding with \u2018do it yourself\u2019, after she tells me it isn\u2019t good enough.\n\n\nYesterday the tire from our car needed to be replaced while we were at the side of the road. I admit it, I suck at changing tires. My wife told me I was going too slow, and I told her she could do it herself. She said no, and I refused to work on the tire again for 30 minutes. \n\n\nWhen we got home she was angry because she needed to go to toilet during those 30 minutes. She called me an asshole and inconsiderate and a bunch of other stuff. \nI just went to our bedroom to relax for a bit.\n\n\nIn defence of my wife, the pregnancy is difficult on her and she had quite a few problems.\n\n\nWhen we went to sleep, she wasn\u2019t talking to me, saying that I am an asshole. \nI am kinda feeling bad now, AITA?\n\nEdit: Some people are confused about me referring to my wife throughout the post, even though we are not married. \n\nWe are not married and are not planning on getting married in the near future. This is a joint decision. \n\nWe do, however, have rings and call each other husband and wife. It is so automatic for me now that I didn't even realise I did it in the post without explaining. We tell people we are married because it is easier and don't want to explain not getting officially married.\n\n\nEdit2: I've decided to sincerely apologise to her and take her out to dinner tonight. And to stop saying do it yourself.",

I just wanted to offer my personal perspective. \n\nI was insanely emotional when I was pregnant. Like good luck even telling me I was too emotional lol, I couldnt and wouldn't hear it. I was so far deep in my emotions and hormones it would have been impossible. But a few days after the baby came, the fog lifted and it felt like I came out of a coma lol. I did not recognize the person I was while pregnant at all.\n\nNow this is not an excuse for bad behaviour and I can totally understand how frustrating it can be for the pregnant persons partner, but sometimes it really is temporary and not indicative of the state of the entire relationship. Pregnancy hormones are fucking wild and they effect everyone differently. \n\nSo, just to give everyone the benefit of the doubt here, if the relationship was totally solid before the pregnancy, it's a good indication it might just be the pregnancy temporarily wrecking havoc.",

You both need to be doing better in how you treat each other- your wife shouldn\u2019t be taking her frustrations with being pregnant out on you and you shouldn\u2019t be retaliating by intentionally making an 8 mo pregnant woman wait to go to the bathroom (believe me, that could have *easily* turned into a humiliating situation for your wife as you physically cannot hold it for too long when you are *that* pregnant). \n\nYou guys have a relationship dynamic issue that you two need to at least start sorting out ***before*** the baby gets here. The stress from sleep deprivation and a crying newborn are just going to make this snipping at each other worse and your patience even more thin. Don\u2019t make your lives with a newborn harder than it has to be. \n\nHonestly: book a couples counseling appointment for next week (if possible). If not possible then find some guided DIY counseling sessions/exercise online or in a book that you can do yourselves (like [this](https://blog.opencounseling.com/diy-marriage-counseling/) or [this](https://positivepsychology.com/couples-therapy-worksheets-activities/)). You guys probably have less than a month before the baby gets here, even *one* appointment to work on your communication and issues with each other would be helpful. \n\nBabies are hard enough as it is- make sure you guys are on the same team before they get here.

The whole house got cleaned from top to bottom.\n\nThe end bit (third trimester) I was a big, fat, hot, uncomfortable mess who could not sleep on my back, constantly needed to pee and even sleeping on my side was difficult, even with a pillow between by legs.\n\nAll of this was combined with a full time stressful job.\n\nOnce the baby is born you are in a whole new way of life and in the first year, at least, or longer, you should really abandon all ideas of what was fair and equal beforehand.\n\nIt all depends on so many factors.  The baby being the most important.  My first clearly did not read the manual and so sleep deprivation was a big factor in my inability to do anything much other feed, change, rock him whilst he screamed his tits off for 15 hours a day for the first 3 months.\n\nDuring this time I did nothing except care for the baby, go to the loo and eat.  Husband did everything else, whilst holding down a full time job.\n\nLuckily baby no 2 had clearly read the manual and by week 12 was sleeping through the night, so I could help out around the house.\n\nWe are now into our 22nd year of parenthood and it continues to be a challenge.  We have had many, many joyful times, but as they grew older the challenges have changed.\n\nYou have to remain flexible and support each other and your children as you all grow and change.",

She could have stopped being an AH, apologized, and they'd have been on their way. Or she could have taken care of the tire without him. She decided to blame him instead because that's the game she wants to play.\n\nSo far he did the right thing: When abuse like this starts you try to stop it gracefully, by talking, for a couple of weeks. When that doesn't work, go zero tolerance - letting the partner's abuse continue unchecked will destroy the relationship, and yourself. Go zero tolerance and talk. If talk doesn't help after a week, get counseling.",
