  "post content": "I\u2019ve known my boyfriend for a pretty long time, and we finally started dating early this year. I really like being with him, and the feeling seems to be mutual. He\u2019s very affectionate and makes me feel loved. We talk about our future plans a lot. He also has a daughter, who I met once & she apparently \u201cloved me,\u201d and we\u2019ve met each other\u2019s parents so I think things have been getting somewhat serious.\n\nLast night, he invited me to a show at a bar where some of his friend\u2019s bands were playing. I didn\u2019t really want to go because I was super tired (in hindsight I should\u2019ve stayed the fuck home and avoided this whole situation...) but I agreed anyway because I wanted to spend time with him. I\u2019m extremely introverted while he has some outgoing tendencies, so I let him socialize with his friends and do his thing while I sat at the bar. No big deal, I've done this plenty of times. Doesn't bother me, and it seems to work for us.\n\nAfter about two hours, the bands finished playing and it was getting late (about 11:30) and we needed to head back to my apartment because we both had work in the morning. I asked him if we could leave, but he kept insisting he wasn\u2019t done socializing and needed to say goodbyes. I stood outside in the rain in a dry area and waited for him. After ten minutes, I started texting him saying \u201cLET\u2019S GOOO!!!\u201d and called him so he\u2019d get a move on.\n\nWhen started driving home, he fucking. lost. it. He started screaming about how I\u2019m trying to control him, how I\u2019m \"Hitler\", how I\u2019m a narcissist and will never be successful in my career or amount to anything. He even said some misogynist shit about women being psychos. I tried to calm him down, because I\u2019ve NEVER had a partner yell at me like that before and it was scary. He wouldn\u2019t change his tone and rationally discuss why he was upset with me. He wasn\u2019t willing to work towards a solution and understand each other\u2019s perspectives. Instead, I was the fucking worst person in the world because I wanted to go home after sitting by myself for two hours while he caught up with friends. In retaliation, I called him a deadbeat dad (he only sees his kid a few times a month) and that his only redeeming quality is that he is attractive. I knew these were low blows, but I felt like I was being attacked and didn\u2019t know what the hell to do because he wouldn't cooperate with me. Obviously, it didn\u2019t go over well.\n\nThis is where it gets really messy. After we arrived at my house, I locked him outside and told him to go away. He refused to leave until I gave him back his overnight bag. So I emptied out the contents, and dramatically threw them out the window. So his clothes were scattered around the parking lot, now wet from the rain.\n\nIn the morning, I received a text from him that said \u201cwell that sucked but I refuse to be around that behavior\u201d and he blocked me on social media.\n\nAITA?",

Anyone who retroactively accuses their ex of narcissism without some kind of concrete diagnosis/action/comorbidity does *generally* come off as the asshole. I wouldn't say the accusers are *generally* narcissists, but I wouldn't say they aren't either. I would say that those who accuse of narcissism typically do not have any deescalation, resolution, or disengagement  skills.",
