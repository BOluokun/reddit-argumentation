  "post content": "My son just graduated high-school and we were paying so he could go on a road trip with his friends. He was suppose to go Wednesday , my wife\u2019s mother and father got in a car accident. They live in another state so we had to drive about 4 hours. My wife was a wreck and wasn\u2019t in the position to drive since we her dad was critical. He pulled through luckily. \n\nWe have two other kids 11 and 7. We can\u2019t leave them at home alone and we couldn\u2019t find a sitter to watch them on such short notice, we even tried our neighbors but he couldn\u2019t do it. So that left our 18 year old. He was pissed to put it mildly but did it. I told him we would make it up to him, and if he could ask if his friend could move it back a week. They couldn\u2019t sadly. \n\nWe were gone for two days, he pulled though. My wife stayed and I headed back, I payed him for watching the kids and went to talk to him about getting him on the trip. It was suppose to be two weeks and they should just be a state over. He blows up about ruining his trip and there is no point going even though it should still 12 days of the trip. He called up a jerk and lock himself in his room. \n\nI need another opinion since this was emergency and he doesn\u2019t seem to care his grandparents almost passed.\n \n\n\nEdit: Well he called his mom, let\u2019s say it didn\u2019t end well,  he did say basically said the same thing he said to me, wife had a breakdown on the phone with him, she sent him the injuries and pictures of grandpa/grandma. He finally came out of his room and told me he isn\u2019t going to go on the trip and the plan tickets aren\u2019t needed. \n\nTalked to my wife, never heard her that mad. Son confirmed what happened, he started yelling at her the moment the call started and she lost her shit when he called her selfish. On good news grandpa has some feeling back in his legs which was a huge concern \n\nFor people saying we didn\u2019t have emergency plan we do, first my closest friend- vacation, main babysitter- not available, backup babysitter- not available, last resort grandparents- hospital.  We tried to find someone that why we even asked our neighbor which I have a good relationship with.\n\nThis will be my last update, had a conversation with my son about everything. Mom and him will have a conversation when she is calms down. His friends are not a state over, they are about two down at this point and going to Mexico. They are probably will get to the boarder tonight, they were suppose to be going to California . He had his passport and everything ready. This is a fucking mess.\n\nI haven\u2019t informed my wife yet and will wait until she is calmer. I\u2019ll leave off with I hope none of you ever have to deal with a situation like this and please remember your parents are human",

It was a true emergency situation and OP did try to find another option. They tried not to f*ck him over, but sometimes circumstances don't allow that.

They're reacting the way the son is, like an immature teenager! When you're a kid, you think you'll never get to take another road trip again. You don't understand the gravity of emergency/near death situations because you think *you're* invincible. Finally, you don't want to take care of your siblings because, well, you're a bratty teenager who wants what they want when they want it.",

So their viewpoint is that of the teenager in the story.\n\nThe one that always gets me the most was the story about a very poor family in a high COL area, and they had a younger teenaged son+daughter sharing a room in a 2bdrm apartment. The daughter said she wanted the brother to sleep in the living room because she was getting older and deserved her own room. Parents said no, share a room.\n\nIt was overwhelmingly YTA and with everyone saying the parents should actually sleep in the living room on a couch and give their bedroom to the daughter. It was usually justified because the children shouldn't suffer because the parents were negligent and couldn't stop having sex, get an abortion, be less poor, get a better job, get a bigger apartment, etc... It was just... You could tell the responses were not from folks that have ever had to pay their own way in life. I'm sad for the folks that come here and feel guilty when they shouldn't be due to this, or the other way around.",

Or the kids wouldn't get the proper attention because everyone else has their own emotions.\n\nMy 10 year old daughter vividly remembers being in the waiting room when she was 6 and my dad died. We were going to visit him after a surgery and didn't know he was going to die, so she was there. She didn't see it, but the emotions of all of us in the waiting room are a stark memory for her, and meanwhile grandpa's in ICU, not dead yet, we're worried and trying to process, she's trying to figure out what's happening. Someone at the hospital gave her a stuffed unicorn. My mom's crying. I'm numb, in shock. My wife comes to get my daughter, and my wife is in tears. She's 6. She's seeing people who are her rock act in ways that are strange. She knows grandpa's not doing good, but doesn't know what that means. \n\nOP had no idea if grandpa was going to make it or not. Dad was in critical condition. What I just described, my own experience, was perfectly possible at the time.
