  "post content": "I\u2019m 28 (nb) and a new professor at an art college. I teach core classes about politics, sociology, and anthropology. Most teaching evals, feedback from my dean and chair, and students feedback give me high ratings in creating a safe environment for discussion. Students say I do a good job relating to students from different views, backgrounds, and expressions. \n\nThis is something I take seriously\u2014especially as one of the only (that I know of) out non-binary professors at the college. I also take it seriously as someone who firmly believes in the integrity of the classroom. And empowering students to have hard discussions. \n\nI make it a point to never complain about students. Even when they say something transphobic. I politely encourage them to learn and I\u2019m rated as pretty gentle about getting them to think another way. \n\nRecently, I had one of my most uncomfortable teaching experiences which seems silly. I had a student who is not from Japan, never spent time in Japan, but loves anime and used a hypersexual, over exaggerated, baby like voice known as \u201canime voice\u201d. \n\nShe took on what she perceives as a Japanese name and I just really acted over excited over the top constantly. \n\nAs someone who has had women students from Japan, I felt like it was at least mildly racist and just cringe for everyone to listen. \n\nI pulled her into a convo and tried to let her see how I at least saw it. And she has since retaliated saying I don\u2019t respect the accents or names of students. \n\nThis hurts. Admittedly, I\u2019m a white professor but this student is not Asian. I suspected she might be on the spectrum so I tried to be gentle but firm but as an autistic person, autism is not an excuse for inappropriate behavior. \n\nShe reported me as an unsafe professor which I feel like ruins it for the international students I teach, whose names I pronounce correctly, whose accents I support, and the LGBT+ students who get to have an out non-binary professor for the first time. \n\nThe admin is mostly white and they kept asking \u201care you sure she isn\u2019t from Japan?\u201d And I\u2019m like yes, 1. This is not how people from Japan talk 2. She did a project about where she is from and she admitted to never spending time in Japan. \n\nAs an anthropologist, I feel it\u2019s deeply irresponsible for her to use this voice. And since it is perceived as hypersexual, it made me super uncomfortable. I\u2019m not sure how other students felt because I didn\u2019t want to give her any attention over it. \n\nPeople have suggested I was too harsh. That people can take on the names and accents they want to. Am I the a**hole here?\n\nedit: she has audibly moaned a couple times. The second time is when I pulled her aside before class (before many other students were there). I also have a class full of anime fans and people who love the subculture in the class. I\u2019m also feminine/queer presenting and AFAB, so it made me uncomfortable how she would also compliment me in the voice or say how much she loved my dresses. Other students have complimented my fashion but not like this. Something was off about it.\n\nSecond edit: I\u2019ll take comments stating \u201cYTA\u201d that\u2019s why I\u2019m here to learn. But comments questioning whether or not I\u2019m trans or I experience transphobia isn\u2019t okay. I\u2019m read by society as a male because I\u2019ve taken hormones for years. Had surgeries. Not that I need to explain this to somehow justify this students behavior or explain what others have pointed out: the class is being sexually harassed.",

Saying \"they shouldn't wear cosplay/cat ears because it's distracting to other students\" is similar to when schools blame girls for having their shoulders exposed and \"distracting the boys\". Or saying \"boys can't wear skirts/dresses because it's distracting other students\" (a common transphobic argument). \n\nWearing cat ears might be \"weird\" but is it *that* much \"weirder\" than a lot of other things teenagers do? And who does it harm? If they wear them every day I doubt other students would be distracted for long. Let kids dress how they want and teach other kids not to be judgemental-- that's the more important lesson. \n\nNow with that being said, obviously moaning/making others feel sexually harassed is different. But I think people in this thread are justifying *a lot* (like policing people's clothing) on the basis of \"these people are weird and I don't like it\", not *really* because of true concerns regarding racism or sexual harassment.",

And saying that Japanese women/girls don't use this voice is categorically incorrect. If you'd ever visited Japan you'd notice young girls using it everywhere during normal everyday settings. Many girls working retail or at restaurants use it and all the girls at maid cafes or working at the hostess clubs use it.\n\nSo sorry but you're wrong. This is a style that young Japanese girls her age adhere to. It's super super annoying (to be honest I hate it and worry about their vocal cords) but as an Asian woman I don't find it racist at all. She's copying what she sees as a style she likes. All teens do this and btw, it's not a sexual style, it's supposed to be cutesy.\n\nMoaning however is not normal (and not part of the style) and shouldn't be done outside a brothel or bedroom. If you had stopped at just saying the moaning is inappropriate I'd say you're in the right but maybe in the future leave it to Japanese people to decide what they find racist.\n\nEdit: Someone below and elsewhere on this thread pointed out that the student isn't copying the normal gyaru high pitched voice that many Japanese girls use. The student is copying a very racist tik tok trend (called hentai voice? or something like that sorry I don't use tiktok). So I think OP probably has the right grasp of the situation and my image of what the student was copying was way off.",
