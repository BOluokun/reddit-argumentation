  "post content": "I (29M) broke up with my ex girlfriend over 5 years ago when I caught her cheating on me. We had a 7 month old son that I learned wasn\u2019t mine  after I demanded a paternity test and so I was out of his life after that. It hurt going through all that but what hurt the most was some people in my family being against me leaving \u201cmy son.\u201d Some stopped talking to me, others I stopped talking to like my mom because she still wanted to accept my ex\u2019s kid like her first grandchild. So I said fine and cut contact. Last year I had my first son. We celebrated his one year birthday on the 1st of this month. When my girlfriend got pregnant my mom reached out and wanted to make amends. For us to be in eachother\u2019s lives. She said she hasn\u2019t had any more contact with ex. I was mostly thinking for my son and that it would be nice for him to know his grandma so I gave her a chance.\n\nOn the actual day of my son\u2019s birthday, my brother saw my mom first and goes \u201coh shit.\u201d He saw her getting out of the car with my ex\u2019s kid from the window and he told me. My brother told me he had no idea she was gonna bring the kid and said he\u2019ll keep her outside if I want. I went outside instead and my mom had the kid wait in the car while we talked.\n\nI was so pissed I remember yelling at her for trying to bring him to my son\u2019s birthday. My mom kept apologizing for hiding it she just felt really bad because his real dad doesn\u2019t want to be involved. And they still have pictures of me and him from when he was a baby so he still thinks he\u2019s my kid. It was hard not to lose anymore of my cool so I just remember saying \u201cget the fuck out and don\u2019t ever come back or bring him around again.\u201d It was a whole thing and everyone who was already there saw it play out. My mom left and my brothers were trying to cheer me up and get the party back in a happy mood for my son. \n\nSome family were in a bad mood and they left early. The shit storm happened after that and they\u2019re mad for how I treated my mom. Even she\u2019s said something too that she\u2019s hurt how much I disrespected her and she knows it was wrong to lie, but she was really trying to make it easier on ex\u2019s son by making him feel part of a family. \nShe really thinks I need to give him a chance  because I \u201cloved him once.\u201d I just hung up on her.\n\nStill everyone\u2019s on me calling me a a-hole for callously kicking her out for having good intentions even if they were misplaced. AITA?",
