  "post content": "Throwaway account. This happened Saturday, but everything is still really bad between us.\n\nI (30F) have a severe genetic condition that affects the way my body makes collagen. I am on permanent disability because of the impact of my condition and how much time I spend in the hospital.\n\nBecause of this, and because of the risk pregnancy causes, I decided to not have children. I'd rather not have my insides suddenly rupture out of nowhere, I don't want to pass on the horror I'm dealing with to anyone else, and if I make it to 50, I will be damn lucky. I am also not in a relationship because I feel sickening guilt over the possibility of forcing a partner to be a caretaker when I have worse days and knowing they would likely outlive me and have to handle my eventual passing. I've had several friends with my condition not make it out of their 30s.\n\nI met Kelly (35F) who has a different subtype of the same disease in an online support group four years ago, found out we lived in the same area, and we became friends IRL, and we have been a huge emotional support system to one another. I was part of Kelly's wedding party two years ago right before everything shut down. Now, she is expecting her first child, and at first, I was thrilled for her.\n\nBut now, every time we see each other, all she does is complain about how much more everything hurts, how she's so tired, how she's so done with this bs, and how much she hates being pregnant and can't wait to get the b*stard* out of her (her actual words). And my complaints about whatever I'm dealing with get brushed aside because she insists that she's going through so much worse because she's pregnant and I'm not.\n\nAfter four months of this, I ended up exploding at her. I told her to shut up. That she knew with her illness, she'd have so much more risk of pain and complications, she KNEW what she was getting into when she started trying for a baby, and she had this discussion with her doctors many times over. \n\nShe accused me of being jealous. I told her that I was actually mad as hell about how ungrateful she was, and how I don't want to hear another word from her about how awful it is to get everything you ever dreamed of having.\n\nWe haven't spoken since. Truth is, I am jealous. I would love to feel like I deserved a loving partner. I would love to have kids. But I can't do this to someone else, and I can't sit there and listen to someone who gets to have what I want act like it's the worst thing to ever happen to them.\n\nMy mom thinks it isn't worth losing a friendship and I should have been the one to shut up and endured her complaints. She insists that I owe her an apology for being insensitive because I \"have no idea what pregnancy is really like\", which just made me feel worse.\n\nWhat's word, reddit? Should I suck it up and be happy for Kelly?",
