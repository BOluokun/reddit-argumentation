  "post content": "I (15f) share a bathroom with my sister (18f). Until about a year ago we shared a bathroom with our parents, but we moved so now they have their own bathroom. \n\nWhen our parents shared the bathroom too my sister cleaned up after herself, but since it's only us sharing it she stopped. Hair all over the shower, wet towels and dirty clothes on the floor, shit stains in the toilet, whenever she trims her bangs the sink is covered with hair she just leaves there, and more. I have to clean the bathroom before I can shower in the morning. The grossest thing is when she leaves underwear with used pads on the floor. \n\nI've tried everything I can think of. Talking to our parents, talking to her, making a cleaning schedule, cleaning up after her, or not cleaning up and just letting her live in that filth. Nothing has worked, I've been stuck cleaning up after her for a year (at least if I want a clean bathroom myself). \n\nI warned her once that if she didn't clean up her used pads on the bathroom floor I'd put them somewhere everyone could see. Well it happened again, so I hung her underwear (with the pad) on the door handle of the bathroom on a day my sister's boyfriend was coming over. I don't know what happened, but my sister is extremely pissed. My parents aren't happy either and told me to just talk to them next time. (I did, very often. Never worked.)\n\nI feel bad about involving her boyfriend in this, but I couldn't think of anything else to do. I'm assuming I was an asshole, but the bathroom was clean this morning. \n\nAITA?\n\nSidenote: My sister does keep her bedroom clean, and she had no problem cleaning the bathroom when we shared it with our parents.\n\nEdit: I'm 15, my sister is 18. I didn't think it mattered but some people mentioned it in the comments: I hung her panties (with the pad) on the door handle by the leg hole, I didn't stick a dirty pad directly on the door. That would be gross.\n\nINFO: I used to put anything I could move in her room, I've even put it on her bed or desk a few times. It hasn't worked.",

They'll probably still be angry at you, but stay calm and keep on pressing the point, that it is not fair that you have to live with this mess.",

Finally, we got so fed up, we took all her crap from around the house (dirty clothes, spoiled food, dirty moldy dishes, etc.) and put all of it in her bed and pulled her quilt on top of it. We closed the door to her room and just left it. She didn't come back home for about three days and it was in May, so the weather was pretty warm. You can imagine the smell. IIRC, she ended up actually just throwing out the clothes that were in the mix because they were that gross.\n\nShe was PISSED - but we all felt not one ounce of remorse. We gave her ever chance in the world and she didn't take one of them. She moved out about a month later, but didn't make another mess during that time. Buh-bye.",

I also had to stop her (unfriendly and aggressive) dog from eating them on multiple occasions. \n\nLiving with her was a nightmare. When we moved in, I noticed the tub wouldn\u2019t drain at all, so I put on some heavy duty dish gloves, dug around in the drain, and pulled a 7\u201d long, 1\u201d wide, completely solid hairball out (she had long, thick brown hair - I had a black pixie at the time and my boyfriend has short dirty blond hair, so it was obvious who the culprit was. Her reaction? \u201cOh, I had no idea the tub wasn\u2019t draining\u201d - I guess standing in 5\u201d of stagnant water while showering didn\u2019t strike her as unusual at all). \n\nShe also made DIY body scrubs with coffee grounds and honey and never cleaned up after herself, so the entire shower would be splattered with a sticky, grainy, dark brown mess that looked like explosive diarrhea. Whenever she shaved, she\u2019d leave leg hair and pubes all over the tub. \n\nShe\u2019d use our plates, then leave them in the kitchen sink in several inches of black/brown water - I had to show her how to use a garbage disposal because she didn\u2019t know how (we were both 26 at the time). \n\nIt was all really strange because I\u2019ve known her since middle school and she never struck me as particularly unhygienic or gross. There really are people out there like OP\u2019s sister and my former housemate, as horrifying as it may be to imagine ... and even worse to live through.",
