  "post content": "I (28F) am married to Josh(30M). We\u2019ve been together since freshman (him junior) year of college. We have a lot of pets in the house- 3 dogs, 3cats, a bunny, a turtle, a snake and a macaw. We love all of them and spent a lot of time making sure we take care of them.\n\nI am on maternity leave currently and my due date is in three months. I decided to foster a litter of puppies along with the mama after I saw she was scheduled to be euthanised. \n\nMy SIL(30F yes they are twins with my husband) lost her job recently and asked to stay with us. She does contribute towards bills but does not pay rent or anywhere near 1/3 of the bills around the house. I don\u2019t mind as she still makes an effort. She got sick last week so she is still recovering and not actively looking for a job.\n\nShe has been making faces left and right about the pets, claiming she has allergies, the macaw is too loud when it talks, the dogs pitter-patter around the house is annoying, the cats sleep on her clean laundry.. I think she only likes the bunny and turtle as the snake apparently grosses her out as well.\n\nJosh, my husband, told her she should stop complaining and check her allergies and maybe close her door so cats don\u2019t go in (dogs never do). She huffed and puffed until this morning where she saw she had a rash and went to get it checked out. They told her it was an allergy and she lost it. Came back waving the papers with the diagnosis and shoved them in my face. I said she should go get tested for what kind of allergy it was and she looked at me like I was dumb.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your goblins around the house. You need to get rid of them or I might get a more severe reaction.\u201d\n\nI laughed and said no. Josh came back from work and the two had a huge argument which ended up with Josh saying we might be able to compromise on the rescued doggo mama and pups. The two came up to me and I refused. I have made a commitment to take care of her and I am not returning her to the pound. Plus, how removing her helps any, I don\u2019t understand. 90% of the time she is in a downstairs bedroom with her pups or in the backyard. She has no contact with my SIL. Our dogs and cats are free to go anywhere.\n\nMy SIL got pissy, said I was prioritising a stray mutt to her health and said I was right, the stray wasn\u2019t the issue. I could keep it, but I gotta board it in a pet hotel along with her puppies and our animals. That\u2019s 16 animals on an average price of 40$ per animal, and that is even if an establishment is crazy enough to take 6-week-old puppies. So this comes up to 640$ per day. I told her she is welcome to pay it but I\u2019ll board them only for a week and then she needs to move out.\n\nShe lost her cool, called me a unconsidered a-hole, I was trying to kill her with my pets and was kicking her to the curb over a d*mn mutt. Josh backed me up but their mother called and said I was a jerk and her son made a mistake ever marrying me. Josh is still arguing with relatives, his sister is still in the house crying and I am just about done.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: their mother lives far away. SIL doesn\u2019t wanna move so far away.\n\nEdit: we went at it again. She is crying and obviously there is snot from CRYING but she is insisting it\u2019s the animals and her allergies. Josh is saying she is broke and we need to give her a month or two before she can move out even to their mom\u2019s (apparently she has no savings). She said I was unable to make compromises (reddit gave me some confidence thank you all). \n\nShe is calling her mom nonstop and saying she feels like she is choking and might call an ambulance but her \u2018anaphylactic\u2019 shock has been on and off for about two hours so it\u2019s safe to say she is exaggerating. I do have an epipen in the house if she is actually serious.\n\nMy MIL wants to join in on the fun and Josh is trying to dissuade her as I am refusing to have another relative of his in the house indefinitely. My hormones are going crazy and I wanna cry as well. Please pray for me because I am very close to kicking everyone out and just becoming the crazy lady with the zoo in the house.\n\nEdit: in-laws got very quiet when Josh and I offered to ship her back to them. They claim they\u2019ve fell on hard times and cannot support her. My MIL has been asking Josh to pay for a plane ticket so she can come settle this for us in person and my SIL is over the moon. We will not be housing any more of Josh\u2019s relatives.\n\nAs a temporary solution, even though I feel she does not deserve it, my dad has graciously offered to have her over. He does not have pets currently. My SIL is refusing because it\u2019s embarrassing for her that my part of the family knows she is broke but Josh is working his magic on his twin. Fingers crossed she is out of the house by tomorrow and my MIL settles down.\n\nAnd yes, we will be paying for all that jazz but I am willing to give any amount of money to have her out. She has been screaming any time she runs into one of the pets like it\u2019s gonna attack her and I cannot deal with that.\n\nEdit (last one I promise) I have no intention of keeping my rescue mama and puppies. That is 10 dogs they are getting adopted out people. I WON\u2019T keep them. I am not hoarding them. In a few weeks we\u2019ll be back to having 3 dogs, 3 cats, 1 bunny, 1 turtle, 1 bird. Is it a lot? Yes. Are the vet bills crazy? Yes. Am I hoarding? No. All of them are rescues who have visual defects that are harder to adopt out with. \n\nOne of the cats has a nasty scar on her chest, another has her ears completely cut off, the bunny is missing a leg, dogs have scars from fighting or beating, the macaw is just a jerk.. so yeah, I\u2019ve taken them because they are harder to adopt out.",

If you give in on your Foster and her pups, it will be the rest of your animals before long as she'll say she still has her rash. Flat out tell her no and it's not up for debate. I read your comment about how far away their mother is, but leave her go there. She's homeless. Beggars can't be choosers\n\nEDITED TO ADD: no boarding kennel is going to take 6 week old puppies. They won't have had their parvo shots yet . Contact with other dogs could cause them to contract parvo and in all likelihood given their age, they wouldn't survive it.",
