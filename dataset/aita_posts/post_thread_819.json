The guy, instead of giving me back my money states that I should just try and sign a few people up instead which would net me a small amount per month, something my friend conveniently forgot to mention.  Upon realizing this, I cancelled my investment and now demanding a refund as I feel used by my friend for money. AITA for basically putting an end to friend's secret gravy train? Thank you.  \n\n\nEDIT: I was buying stocks and trades, I'm not mad at the program itself, I am mad that my friend recommended me without mentioning that she would've financially benefited as well, Hence why I feel used by my friend, It's not a one time behavior with said friend.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJudgment                                                                 Abbreviation**You're the Asshole** (& the other party is not)    **YTA**\n\nYou're **Not the A-hole** (& the other party is)       **NTA**\n\n**Everyone Sucks Here                                             ESHNo A-holes here                                                      NAH**\n\n**Not Enough Info                                                     INFO**",
