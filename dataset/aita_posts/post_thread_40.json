  "post content": "My (28M) wife (31F) has recently started to express interest in being a SAHW to prep for being a SAHM. We don't have kids and haven't been trying, and before getting married, we talked about kids and work/home arrangement and we agreed that we\u2019d both work prior to and once we had kids, and agreed we'd take turns with the 'stay at home' portion for the first year or two after potential kids were born then both back to work.\n\nNow she wants to do away with that and wants to be a stay-at-home wife until we have kids and then be a stay-at-home mom. I don't want that, I never wanted that, and I made that clear from the start when we got serious. I enjoy my job a lot but my salary can\u2019t sustain a family and I don't want to go back to school and change careers like she wants me to to make it happen. I don't want to take up a second job either knowing I'd still be doing half the housework and childcare (not that that's a bad thing) whereas both my mom and her parents are local she'd have plenty of help during the day and able to get downtime.\n\nWe had dinner at my mother's a couple days ago with my sister and her kids. While we were there my wife goes:\n\n\"Your son's being mean, he won't let me be a stay-at-home mom.\"\n\nFirst my family took this as she's pregnant and got excited so I had to tell them that wasn't it. She just wants to be a stay at home. It turned into this three-on-one conversation about how I should let her stay home if that's what she really wants and I should be taking care of her and finding a way to make this happen for her. Finally I go:\n\n\"Would you two help her with the house whenever she needs it?\"\n\n\"Of course! That's what family is for! Especially when you start having kids we'll help!\"\n\n\"Cool. Keep that same energy and help me pay all our bills and every other expense to upkeep our current quality of life if you feel so strongly she should get to stay home.\"\n\nThey did not like that and told me I was being overdramatic. My mom called me stubborn and told me to find corners to cut to afford everything on my salary and drop things like streaming services, some of my hobbies, go from two cars to one, etc. We left and my wife wasn't too happy on the way home. She says I was out of line for saying that to my mom and sister especially since she thinks I was serious. Was I the a-hole for telling my mom and sister to pay our bills if they wanted me to go along with it?\n\nE: Please stop with the vasectomy messages. They aren't 100% reversible, success rate goes down each year post procedure and I DO want kids someday. I am mindful that a babytrap is always possible.\n\nE2: Holy crap this blew up. Thanks everyone for all of your responses. I do know to be careful of oopsie babies right now so abstinence instead of just condoms for now. For those of you insisting I reconsider- no, look I'm glad the Stay-at-home/one income works for you all and you enjoy it, but it's not for me. I'm well aware 1 income means being financially tight, but its more than that- I don't want the stress of making sure I'm making enough on my own with 2 jobs, and also doing my part in the house and being a parent. I'd much rather get to spend time with my kids when I have them, not be a stranger that falls asleep at dinner and spends a bit of time like my father was. Since this post was more about my mom and sister, (I know all about the issues my wife is presenting atm and my options) I'm going to tell them to lay off. Either they do, or I just drop contact with them but I won't be giving them an ultimatum about it. ",

What she really wants is to get married and just do nothing from her end with regards to finances. And I bet that even after you have a kid, she'll complain about how difficult it is to raise a kid and play the victim then too. \n\nSorry to be blunt about it OP, but this woman is using you. Also, the fact that she brought this up unprompted in front of your family shows that she's manipulative. She knows that if she just talks to you about it, you'll stand your ground. But bringing it up in front of your family gave her backup (your mum and sister). And what you said to them was absolutely right.

Like others have said, if your wife is *this* determined to do SAHW/SAHM and you don't even have kids yet, she can easily poke holes in them and that's that. If you aren't interested in having kids yet, consider getting her to get birth control shot or birth control implant. She seems like she wouldn't be trustworthy enough to not \"forget\" an oral BC. And even if none of all that other stuff, condoms can and will break in various circumstances. The safest way to keep from an accidental pregnancy is BC *and* condoms, each has the other to fall back on in case of failure.\n\nThat being said, if she already doesn't respect you enough to not keep to agreements you and she made before marriage, she's not going to respect you down the line either when you do have a kid, and it'll just get worse. I'd consider counseling if I were you. If she can turn around her behavior and get counseling for her manipulative behavior, there's a chance you might could work things out. But don't go breaking your back trying to show her the difficulties of the life she's envisioning. Just flat out say no if it isn't what you want. She can respect that, or leave. You've tried to offer compromise, have been super fair (more fair than I ever would have!). She wants you to hop through all these insane hoops so she can have a comfy cushy lifestyle while you do all the hard work, and that's not right. \n\nFor the record, I think someone mentioned in a sub somewhere about how there's counseling specifically geared towards an abusive person, I don't remember what it was called exactly. You might consider this route, because her behavior sounds narcissistic and selfish at the least. Regular counseling would just give her an outlet to say you're being unfair, controlling her goals, etc etc, with the counselor validating her abuse. That other counseling would help her recognize her behavior and actions as wrong and how she can go about changing that behavior to something more positive. Good luck OP, I really hope things get better for you!",
