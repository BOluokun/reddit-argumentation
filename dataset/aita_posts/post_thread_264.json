  "post content": "My wife (37f) and I (38m) have 3 kids, 12, 10, and 8. She is in a constant state of overwhelm and very easily irritated, constantly complaining how it's all too much. I'm of course happy to help and do my fair share for the kids or household, but it's never enough because her standards are too damn high. \n\nShe insists one of us has to be up at 6:45 every morning to make sure the kids are ready and make the bus which comes at 7:45. I told her they're old enough to not need that much help already. They can all dress themselves and pour themselves cereal and milk, there's no reason we have to be up. She says that cereal isn't a good enough breakfast, they need something more substantial, especially the 12 year old, and that the 10 year old has adhd and will definitely struggle without help in the morning and anyway she wants to see them off and kiss them goodbye for the day. So she gets up, I don't, then she gets upset that I never give her a morning off when all she needs to do is just take the morning off when she wants and let the kids handle themselves. \n\nAlso she is super strict about screen time during the week and is exhausted and snappy from arguing about it with the kids and upset i don't support her strict limit of 2 hours a day. I say as long as homework is done, why not until bed. She says it's not healthy for them, they need to play outside or with games and toys, read some books, just entertain themselves in more ways than 1. I agree they should enjoy other things but not seeing why we have to make such a rigid limit. She also likes to get out on weekends and do stuff like zoos, museums etc, but then complains about the planning for the outing and how grouchy the youngest gets by the end of it, and again, I say let's just chill at home and voila, you've cut the work! \n\nI'm an engaged and active parent, I'm not trying to get out of it, but I don't think I should have to help my wife dig herself out of her own self created holes. She creates the stress for herself and then turns to me to alleviate it which I think is unfair. AITA for telling her she needs to do less and then she won't need this level of help?",

Your wife\u2019s standards are just\u2026being a decent parent, and you are not doing your \u2018fair share\u2019 if you aren\u2019t helping with these things you consider \u2018unnecessary\u2019. An 8 year old and a ten year old with ADHD are not ready to totally get themselves ready in the morning, and you\u2019d know that if you didn\u2019t sleep through the morning routine every day. Two hours of screen time a day is a totally reasonable boundary. And family time and enriching activities are also important. Maybe those can be cut down slightly, but \u2018just chill at home\u2019 all the time isn\u2019t the answer either. Stop being lazy and become an actually engaged parent like your wife is.",

I was one of them and it was pretty normal in my social circles and now I am a teacher and know this from lots of students - from when I was 8 my parents left at 4:45 and 6:30 for work and I had to get up and ready on my own.

Kids are also horribly addicted to screens these days, so 2 hours a day is actually quite a bit, especially if they use computers or phones during school time too. ADHD already has attention span issues coded into it, so to add 2 hours a day is just bad in overall. \n\nDude is the guy who thinks fatherhood is super easy because he doesn\u2019t have to actually do anything.",
