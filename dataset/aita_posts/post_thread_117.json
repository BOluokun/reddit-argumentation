  "post content": "Sorry for any grammatical errors or formatting problems I\u2019m typing on mobile. \n\nSo my birthday is tomorrow and I\u2019m inviting some friends tomorrow to play smash ultimate. I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up like this . \nAnyway here\u2019s some answers to some questions.\n\nI\u2019m 14 turning 15 \n\nMy mom says I\u2019ve seen this kid before, but I feel like it\u2019s in the sense of that Aunty that changed your diaper when you were 1 year old that you don\u2019t remember.\n\nI asked my mom if we\u2019re cousins that I maybe didn\u2019t know about . She said no.\n\nApparently my mom gives my old clothes to him . \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stand up to my parents. Maybe if I were older and had something to fall back on.\n\nMy dad said the kid is staying because his mom wants to go to church and they live really far so it\u2019s just easier to stay the night.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time they pulled something and didn\u2019t tell me. Around Christmas time my mom signed me up for volunteering at a Christmas play and she didn\u2019t mention it until we got in the car.  We were there for 5 minutes and they didn\u2019t mention we were doing this as a family. The Christmas play was late night and really long so it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do on my Saturday night. I guess they realized they were in the wrong and didn\u2019t make me go.\n\n\n\nEdit 2:  Hey guys I\u2019m back . I\u2019m gonna tell you about my birthday party. So of the 5 people I invited only 1 came and the 10 year old. We had a good time laughing and stuff and I\u2019m pretty friendly with the 10 year old now. The friend left around 15 minutes and we\u2019re just here watching  American idol. I guess I became friends with him.",

Kids are people, with their own needs and feelings, and when you bring a child into the world and thus into your home, you should recognise that it was your actions that put them there. They don't have a choice because they are your dependants, and you should take responsibility for not shitting on their emotional wellbeing just because you're old enough to have a paycheck and therefore have all the power. </probablyunpopularopinion>",

I was upset but she told us it was like a thing at a hotel so I thought it wasn\u2019t so bad. The day of we go to the church and just see a school bus waiting there so I wasn\u2019t really enthusiastic.  We bought other stuff like water jugs and sleds. Somehow I didn\u2019t put together that you don\u2019t bring jugs to a hotel. We rode for hours and just stopped to get burgers. When we got there finally it was night and we had to walk to our cabin. Keep in mind we live in Michigan and it was really icy and dark. We got there and they told us to walk to the cafeteria which was the other side. Along the way we fell from walking into a random haystack just there. \n\nOnce we got there they started a speech about god or something and were there for what felt like eternity. We left,we went to bed on our leather bunk beds, and tried to sleep. We did a bunch of random crap I don\u2019t remember but I do remember some of the worse things. The event itself was a thing for dads and little kids. I was the only teen there. When we tired to sleep they\u2019d run in screaming like every 30 seconds. My dad fell multiple times in the ice and was limping around. I hurt my foot while getting up on the top bunk. The beds were really uncomfortable. No shower or fresh water. We always had to walk to the cafeteria in the ice multiple times a day. \n \nOne kid tried to steal my phone. No WiFi so I couldn\u2019t connect with anyone.  We rode in the bus so we couldn\u2019t just leave.\n\nAll this while my mom and grandma had the time of their lives. ",

There are some alarm bells in the camp story, but I'd hesitate to jump straight to \"narc!\"\n\nAre these parents controlling? Yes. Lacking understanding? Yes. Doing some things that, from the perspective we're seeing, arent great? Absolutely yes. But not every sub-par parent is a narc. \n\nEdit: there's potential for them to be narcissists, but I'd say more religious-controlling than narcissistic from the info we're given.

There's clearly something going on completely unrelated to OP's birthday that the dad has not decided to share, either because it's too sensitive or OP would be too young to understand/sympathize.  \n\nBest case scenario, we might just be looking at an anodyne situation where dad's friend wants a date night with his wife and asked dad for a solid, and it just sucked on the timing for OP.  More likely, there's some issue with the 10-year-old's home life that taking him out of it for a night was a real favor to both the kid and dad's friend.  \n\nSaying this because I've very much been that 10-year-old.  I used to go to sleepovers at friends' houses at a young age often simply to get away from (or be put away from) my extremely toxic family.  Usually by choice, but not always.\n\nOP is NTA [EDIT: I really mean NAH], but I would say that if he's not expected to entertain the 10-year-old he shouldn't be particularly upset.  It really may be that the younger kid needs a place to briefly camp for any number of perfectly valid reasons that don't directly affect OP and won't interfere with his birthday.",
