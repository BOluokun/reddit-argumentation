  "post content": "Throwaway because.\n\nLast weekend was my (M28) birthday. My girlfriend (F25) had asked what I wanted to do and I said I wanted to watch my favorite movie trilogy, LOTR. I don't think my girlfriend was thrilled but she didn't say anything and agreed. She has seen them before and I don't think she really likes them very much but she knows I love them so she doesn't really say anything besides they aren't really her thing. \n\nBut I really wanted to make a day of watching them and I went over to her house because she has a really big comfortable couch.  About ten minutes into the first movie and I look over and she is browsing on her phone. I was a little miffed but didn't say anything. She basically scrolled through her phone the entire movie. When we started the second movie, she opened a bottle of wine and proceeded to drink the whole thing, while still sitting on her phone. I was pretty irritated at this point because she wasn't even paying attention at all. \n\nThe third movie started and by then she had opened another bottle of wine and was asleep within the first twenty minutes. I was really mad at that point and just left and went home. \n\nA few hours later I got a text asking where I went. I told her I was mad that she couldn't pay attention to my favorite movies on my birthday. She told me I was an asshole and to grow the hell up. I've texted her a couple times but she hasn't responded. AITA?\n\nEdit: This has really blown up and I've gotten a little overwhelmed, but I do accept that I was the asshole. Watching 9 hours of movies that she hates was definitely too much of an ask and I shouldn't have reacted the way I did. I just took it personally because I felt like she didn't even try and these movies are important to me. The fact that she isn't much of a drinker and drank this much kind of set me off. I called and left her a voicemail apologizing.",

Why does it matter if she's paying attention? What do you gain from that except the validation of forcing someone to pay attention to something you like for however long that bloody trilogy is? I mean, that is *not* a small amount of time she dedicated to being there with you despite you both knowing she would get nothing from it. You are kinda ungrateful and controlling.\n\nNot to mention the way you just let yourself get angrier and angrier about it until you stormed out without saying anything. She's right. You could stand to grow up.",

Basically, we do our own things. But we do them cuddled up next to one another. Or in the same room. I personally adore that time. \n\nIt sounds like your girlfriend was happy to sit with you as you enjoyed rewatching LOTR. But she can\u2019t *make* herself be interested. It does sound like she was interested in being there with you, though!",

If you're asking someone to make a big time commitment to watching a series you need to accept they might be bored and wander off, especially if they have seen it before. If you're asking them to sit with you and watch something they hate you should probably accept they will be on their phone the whole time. \n\nAlso the fact that his ex-gf was apparently uncharacteristically drinking a lot and his reaction is to be upset she wasn't paying attention to his movie marathon is not a great indication of him being a loving partner.",

I would look at my phone, too. Even when I\u2019m watching one movie at home I check my phone or reply to texts.\n\nYTA, OP. She\u2019s in the comfort of her own home because you wanted to watch them at HER place. I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s your birthday. 11+ hours of just movies that she doesn\u2019t enjoy? She *was* compromising. I just turned 39 a couple months ago and went for sushi. One of my friends that came doesn\u2019t like fish very much and never had it before. But she was willing to try one meal. That\u2019s not the same as asking for 11 hours of someone\u2019s uninterruptible time and attention for something they don\u2019t like at all. If you asked her to watch one of the movies, sure, but the whole trilogy? Let her drink and browse her phone.",

But I love my partner so I read the books. He was pleased that I gave them a chance. \n\nThen came the movies. I already know I dislike the series but I love him so once they were all out on dvd I watched them. I fully watched and paid attention.\n\nWe talked about it and, to be fair, I did like some parts. However he understands that if he wants to watch them I have zero problems with it - sometimes I stay in the room but sometimes I go do something else.\n\nOP my point is that while sharing things we love is very important it\u2019s EQUALLY important to respect the fact that your partner may have different opinions. You know she\u2019s not into them. Yes it\u2019s your birthday but why not do/watch/experience something you BOTH enjoy? That way she WILL be happy to pay full attention.\n\nThe fact that she sat there that long shows you she cares for you. But it\u2019s unfair to expect her to sit through all of those movies that she doesn\u2019t like and focus 100% on the movie.\n\nHonestly if I were that big of a fan I\u2019d save watching the movies for when I\u2019m with a friend who also enjoys them.\n\nSoft YTA.

She was sitting with you. She was doing quiet activities. She wasn't making fun of the movie or saying how stupid it was (that would have made her the AH). She wanted to spend time with you even though the activity you picked wasn't something she enjoyed.\n\n I absolutely loath sports on the tv, but I sit with my partner while he watches it and crochet or read while it's going on.

A few years ago he asked me what I wanted to do on a birthday and I said sit in bed and do the trilogy like the old days. He can barely sit through 1.5 hour movies he *enjoys* so he asked if he could do other things on his laptop in bed and I said no problem.",

If it was ONE of the movies, I could see you being upset, but holy moly, all three?! Did you two discuss expectations before agreeing to this? Did you tell her you expected her undivided attention for 11 hours so she could gracefully nope out or offer a compromise? \n\nYou went over to her place because you like her couch, which she was cool with, for the entirety of your LOTR marathon. You knew full darned well she wasn\u2019t keen on the trilogy, but somehow you still expected her undivided attention? She was bored out of her skull, but was quiet about it. She didn\u2019t tap out and ask you to leave. YOU were the one annoyed with HER, while camped out on HER couch. She was keeping herself occupied on her phone while you watched your favorite movies. The woman is a saint. \n\nBut you, the birthday boy, got all bent out of shape because she messed around in her phone and drank two bottles of whine, er, wine, to cope with/accommodate your 11 hour marathon. She fell asleep and you immaturely left without saying a word. The goal should have been to spend time hanging out together for your birthday, which, honestly, was accomplished. You could have very well watched all of that on your own, on your own time in the comfort of your own home. You cannot monopolize half of someone\u2019s day when they feel obligated for the sake of it being your birthday, and then dictate how they cope with boredom. That is torture.",
