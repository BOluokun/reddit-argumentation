  "post content": "Last month my old neighbors moved out and some new ones moved in. A couple in their late twenties with four small children. The wife is a SAHM and the husband is a trucker. I went to introduce myself and bring them a pie right after they moved in. I didn\u2019t really like their vibe but I\u2019m a friendly person so I tried inviting the wife to things. \n\nOur neighborhood is small, a collection of ten houses. Everyone knows everyone and is generally pretty friendly. No one else has young kids though. It\u2019s mostly couples with no kids, or older couples who\u2019s kids moved out. I hang out with two of my female neighbors who are a similar age to my own (mid twenties). We go on walks, have lunch at each others houses, etc. I only work three days a week so I have a lot of free time. \n\nI invited the new neighbor, Molly, to two different things. Lunch at my house and also a walk/hike me and the others were going on. Both time she just assumed she could bring her kids and showed up to my house with them. I turned her away from lunch at my house because I don\u2019t want four rowdy kids under the age of six in my not childproof house. She was upset because she has no one who can ever watch them, and she can\u2019t come without them. She did bring them on a walk with us but we couldn\u2019t go in the forest because of her stroller so it kind of ruined things for us. There\u2019s no trees or shade in the neighborhood and the summer heat makes it awful, the forest is much better.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been avoiding Molly like the plague, I just don\u2019t want to be her friend. She\u2019s invited me over, asked to come over and bring her kids, she even asked me to watch her kids the other day so she can have a break. I barely know the woman and I feel like her behavior is pretty inappropriate and she\u2019s maybe just not picking up on social cues. \n\nToday me and my other neighbors went for a walk in the forest, and she saw us go. She texted me to ask why she wasn\u2019t invited, and I said it\u2019s because we don\u2019t want our plans to be altered by her children, and she\u2019s expressed that she can\u2019t do anything without her children. She went on a rant about how it takes a village and we don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, and she called us all assholes. \n\nI agree with her that I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, because I would personally never choose to have four kids with an absent husband. I just feel like she\u2019s being unreasonable to expect us to have a bad time just so she can have a good time. Her kids were super annoying and hard to deal with. My husband thinks she\u2019s an asshole but my mom thinks I should be more sympathetic. \n\nAITA for excluding my neighbor from activities?\n\nEdit: ok since you guys wanted me to add it, I\u2019ll add it. I asked molly if she had any food allergies and if she was okay with salmon and quinoa for lunch. She had the opportunity to mention she wanted to bring her kids and chose not to take it. I did not make enough food to feed her four kids, because I had no clue she planned on bringing them. I only made food for 4, not 8. Also, when we went on a walk the original plan was to walk in the forest. But at last minute she unilaterally decided we as a group should change our plans and walk the neighborhood instead because her stroller can\u2019t go in the forest. \n\nShe also said \u201cyou\u2019re all a bunch of bitches for not making things easier on a mom\u201d so yeah, bridge burned. Sucks to suck Molly.\n\nEdit 2: it\u2019s like some or y\u2019all have never heard of a babysitter before. Or declining plans you\u2019re invited to.",

She doesn\u2019t work, he works a (fairly) mobile position where they actually have a decent amount of freedom when deciding where to plant their roots. Lots of families don\u2019t have that kind of freedom. I didn\u2019t when we moved.

When you have that many kids, bringing them along with you significantly increases the headcount of a gathering. If someone is inviting you over for a meal and has taken the time to ask about restrictions with food, you should let them know you come with \\*four more mouths for them to feed\\* that's budgeting the neighbor is used to, OP isn't.  Not giving notice is incredibly inconsiderate.\n\nOP has been plenty kind. Her kindness has been met with entitlement and pushiness from a neighbor who seems to think people that barely know her owe her. Extending yourself for someone like that is just an invitation to be treated like a doormat. Where is the neighbor's compassion for OP?",

No one, even childfree by choice folks, cared if my kids came along. If they had, they wouldn't have been my friend group just because it wouldn't work for where I was in my life. So Molly may have (and sounds like she did from her village comment) lived in a previous neighborhood like that and didn't realize this one was different.",

Both rushed to judgment and created a misunderstanding.\n\nOP also claims the neighborhood is having a 4th of July block party and they aren't allowing Molly and the kids to join them because of this issue. This is what makes OP TAH. They are socially excluding Molly as punishment for her feud with OP and the kids are being punished as a result for existing.",
