  "post content": "I\u2019m a 19 year old F with six older siblings. My parents spent most of my childhood spending money they didn\u2019t have on my siblings, so by the time I hit my teenage years, I realized I was probably going to have to fend for myself financially when I turn 18. I started babysitting and doing odd jobs around my neighborhood when I was 14, and eventually got part-time jobs during the school year. \n\n\nBy the time I was 16, I was working three jobs in the summer and two in addition to school. When my parents told me they couldn\u2019t pay for college, I\u2019d already earned enough (along with scholarships) to be able to put myself through college and have plenty left over. I\u2019ve continued to work during the school year, and have been able to make money during quarantine by tutoring online. \n\n\nThe issue began a few months ago, when my eldest sister (29F) got married. My parents spent 30 grand on her wedding, taking out a second mortgage to do so. To make matters worse, my dad was furloughed 6 days after the wedding. They\u2019d effectively dug themselves into a hole they couldn\u2019t get out of. \n\n\nTwo weeks ago, my mom texted me for the first time since the wedding. She didn\u2019t say hi, ask how I was, or make any small talk. She just said \u201cYour dad and I need a favor. When can we call you?\u201d \n\n\nI\u2019d expected this. None of my elder siblings are doing well financially, and they\u2019ve exhausted all other loan options, both from family and the bank. I figured they would text me, ask me to loan them a few thousand, and promise to pay it back when they could figure things out. I was absolutely willing to pitch in a few thousand, and had even considered giving them some of my tutoring jobs so they could make some extra cash. \n\n\nI was not, however, expecting them to demand I GIVE them all the money (close to $40,000) I\u2019d made from the ages of 14-18. \n\n\nThe exact statement my mom had made was \u201cYou made that money under our roof. We were the ones who allowed you to work, so you only have it because of us anyway...We bought you food and clothes for 18 years. That money is only a fraction of what you owe us...\u201d and so on.\n\n\nI said that food, clothes, and shelter were the very minimum, it\u2019s what they signed up for when they chose to become parents, I didn\u2019t ask for any of it, etc. They responded by telling me that if it wasn\u2019t for them, I wouldn\u2019t have the life I have today. I said they were being ridiculous, and hung up. \n\n\nSince that day, both (along with two of my siblings) have continuously hounded me about giving them what is \u201crightfully theirs.\u201d My siblings, who have never been asked to give them money, are still professing that it\u2019s my job as their kid to take care of them. I told them they wouldn\u2019t see a cent of my hard-earned money, and have no right to make such a request.\n\n\nI\u2019m torn. I feel awful for refusing to help them out, but on the other hand, this was their fault. I feel I shouldn\u2019t be responsible for fixing their mess. AITA?",

Even then, it's unlikely you'll be sending large amounts, instantly, often.

Change your school and email passwords also.\n2- Call each banking or financial (read: credit card) company you use, as well as your school and landlord. Inform them you are having family issues and are concerned someone may call trying to impersonate you. Ask them to apply a verbal password in order to access any information. (I included landlord and your school so they can\u2019t try to cal and unenroll you or cancel your leases so that you are stuck having to move in/rely on them.) \n3- assuming you are in the US, call each of the 3 credit bureaus and LOCK DOWN your SSN. \n4- obtain a FREE copy of your credit report and review to make sure your parents have not already opened any cards fraudulently in your name. They have you SSN, so would say this is a definite possibility. If they have then file a police report, contact the lender, and contact each credit bureau to report the fraud. \n\nGood luck. I am sorry you are going through this. You have had to deal with a lot at a young age, but it sounds like it has made you a strong person. Use this experience and cut the negative out of your life. Most Universities offer free therapy for students. I highly suggest you take advantage of this as it will help you sort things out. I truly wish you a great life, and it would be easy to never trust anyone after what your family has put you through. Take advantage of the resources from your university, so that doesn\u2019t happen. You deserve happiness with the family you will eventually create, wether that be with friend you choose or eventually a partner and children of your own.",
