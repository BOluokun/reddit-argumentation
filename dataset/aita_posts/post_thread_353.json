  "post content": "I have a big family that\u2019s incredibly close. We have big family dinners every few months where we all meet at my great grand fathers estate and eat together. Typically how this works is that the women go cook for the time they\u2019re there and the men don\u2019t. Which I am fully aware it\u2019s sexist as hell. That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing. \n\nSome of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc.\n\nThis dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered. \n\nI told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves.\n\nShe told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me. She told me that if I think it\u2019s acceptable to make her do this I\u2019m just as bad as everyone else, while my point is that she needs to make a good first impression.\n\nAITA?",

Xtrawolf you stay here. \n\nGrandma: Oh no honey, you're a guest!\n\nBoyfriend: *already putting hands in soapy water and looking for a sponge*\n\nI bet you can guess how this turned out. The men of the family didn't even notice he was gone. And every single woman in my family absolutely adores my husband, and comments that he must treat me so well. They even tell my cousins, \"You should get a boyfriend like him!\" I am very much not the favorite in my family so it's hilarious to me that all 3 of my grandmas are absolutely smitten. \n\nSide note. I can tell you exactly why the women in your family resent other women who don't labor in the kitchen with them. It's because they want that freedom to relax a little too, and they're jealous. \n\nMy best recommendation to you is to take your girlfriend to the kitchen, have her sit down and chat with your family, and YOU do some dishes or food prep work. That way she is not trying to socialize without you, her safe person, being around. And her \"share\" (although she should NOT have a share of the work!) is being covered by YOU. \n\nI can't believe you have to have it spelled out for you like this, but - YTA if you ditch her in the kitchen to work with strangers while you wander away to go shoot the shit with your male relatives without a care in the world!\n\nEdit: Since people are asking about the 3 grandmas - one is a relative that we call \"Grandma\" but she's not my biological grandmother. My husband also has 3 grandmas - one of his is a step-grandma. You can never have too many grandmas!",
