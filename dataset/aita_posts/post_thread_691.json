  "post content": "My boyfriend \"Kyle\" and I have only been official for the past couple of months. Usually we hang at my place but last night, he thought it would be nice for me to come over to his apartment as his roommate was out of town visiting his parents. He wanted to cook for me, which I thought was super sweet until it actually happened.\n\nSo I went over and watched some TV while he cooked. He didn't want my help at all, which is fine with me because I'm admittedly a pretty shitty cook. Sometimes i'll make pasta but I do a lot of takeout. He made pork chops and sauteed some spinach. When we ate, he kept asking if I liked the food. The pork chops were great so I told him that. The spinach wasn't good, he used way too much oil but I didn't really care because it was really not that big of a deal to me. \n\nBut he just kept asking if I liked the dinner. Like we were talking about work and then he would just bring it back to if I really liked the food. I don't know how many times I had to compliment his fucking pork chops. I was kind of picking at the spinach and he specifically asked me if I liked the spinach. I said it was good because I honestly didn't want to get into a whole thing about it because again, I really appreciated that he cooked in the first place and some oily spinach didn't matter and it was edible.\n\nThen he was like \"You're lying, why are you lying?\" I then basically said I was eating it and I asked him why he was getting so fucking pissed about it. I was pissed off because he was getting so angry when I was trying to be polite and appreciative of his nice dinner. He told me that he didn't want a LIAR for a girlfriend. This REALLY pissed me off and I told him something like \"Fine, your spinach is fucking trash. It's garbage. ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY NOW?\" I don't think thats exactly what I said but I was like beyond angry. He  got smug and smiled and was like \"I knew it. Was that so hard?\" \n\nKyle can be stubborn and obsessed with being right sometimes but on the other hand, so can I. I told him that he can enjoy the rest of his shitty spinach alone and I bounced out of the apartment. We've both texted that last night was \"crazy\" but neither of us apologized lol. But anyway, AITA?\n\nupdate: I showed Kyle this post and both of us are very amused that the final verdict is we both suck. We agree! All is well now and he wants you to know that the spinach wasn\u2019t that oily lmao",

Maybe this is an impass and they can't communicate effectively and shouldn't be together. \n\nBut this certainly isn't as cut and dry as people are presenting it.",

I have had actual arguments about this happen because I was blindsided by someone telling me they secretly hated something I had been making for a while- although it was nothing like this, more of a \"this hurt my feelings, I would rather honesty\" \"oh sorry\" type of thing. \nThis blew up up because OP didn't tell the truth even when she saw him getting specifically upset about the lie- when he was asking specifically about the spinach and asking \"why are you lying\"- and he didn't just explain why he wanted the truth, and that a white lie was more upsetting.\nIt comes down to communicating and knowing your partner. Some people like a white lie, and some people hate them, but if either op or her bf had better communication this would have been an easier solve. \nBoth of them seem to recognize that this got out of hand, which is good, but honestly this should never have needed to blow up in the first place.",
