  "post content": "Throwaway because my sister knows my account.\n\nContext: I (16F) am really into Harry Potter and I recently built the Astronomy Tower and the Hogwarts Express with two Lego sets. We have 4 bedrooms in my house. My two younger sisters, my parents, and I all have our own. For reasons I would rather not specify, my room is busy with another person. I slept with my youngest sister (5F) at first because she has 2 beds on her room. I slept terribly those 2 nights because the air conditioner didn\u2019t reach my side and I couldn\u2019t lower the temperature because of her, so I was a sweating mess.\n\nLast night, we all said goodnight and prepared to sleep, but I first asked my mom if I could sleep with my sister. She said yes. (Note: we have already slept on each other\u2019s rooms without asking permission so I thought it was fine) My sister got mad and threw a tantrum, I was silent the whole time until my mother got sick of my sister\u2019s complaints and blew off.\n\nDuring her anger, she slid her arm in front of my Lego building and made them fall and break into pieces. My heart broke because it took me a lot of patience. After that, both of my parents sent us to sleep. Yes, in my sister\u2019s room. My sister started crying saying that she knew it was her fault, but I should have just sucked it up and slept all sweaty.\n\nThis morning, I was ignoring my mother until I eventually told her I was pissed off about the Legos. She apologized but I said \u201cI won\u2019t forgive you until I see both sets are just like I left them, and I won\u2019t rebuild them, so its up to you.\u201d \n\nShe got mad that I was being \u201ccynical\u201d and is now ignoring me too. My sister thinks I went too far but I think it was fair. AITA?",

If you worked together you wouldn\u2019t feel like you had to fix it yourself, and you and your mother might have some nice bonding time. Just a suggestion.",
