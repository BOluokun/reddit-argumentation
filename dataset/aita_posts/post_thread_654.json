  "post content": "I have two children with my ex. Our daughter\u2019s 5th birthday was the first birthday we weren\u2019t together so we came to the agreement that I would plan everything and he would pay for it. He said I could spend as much money as I wanted and since our daughter was taking the breakup badly, I wanted to go all out for her special day.\n\nDespite acting like he wanted no part in the planning, he was an absolute nightmare. I had his credit card and he originally said he didn\u2019t need me to tell him everything I was spending money on but then he suddenly started being nasty about it. He kept demanding I tell him everything I\u2019d booked and would criticise every little thing. I didn\u2019t care about him wanting input into the party but the way he was speaking to me made me feel dirty for needing to have him pay for everything. I only sucked it up because our daughter knew about some of the things I had arranged for her already which I would\u2019ve had to cancel if I started fighting with him. \n\nNow our son\u2019s 2nd birthday is next month and my ex has once again suggested I plan the party and he\u2019ll pay for it. I've refused because I\u2019m not going to let him make me feel the way he did while I planned our daughter\u2019s again. I told him he would need to plan the party and that I wanted no part in it. He has apologised for how he behaved and he claims he\u2019d never do it again. Granted he has been a lot nicer to me recently but I\u2019m still not comfortable putting myself in that position again. \n\nSince I won't plan the party, he\u2019s making up bullshit claims that I favour our daughter over our son. He\u2019s also said if I don\u2019t plan a party our son wouldn\u2019t have one since he\u2019s too busy to plan it but he could always ask his mother for help.\n\nAITA?",

As well as she said she went all out, and he had said it would be ok at the start, then suddenly he was interested-id say likely because he didn't realise she was going to go all out Kardashian style and wanted to know where his money was being spent, and why it was costing so much, likely much more than he anticipated and probably because she did more knowing it was coming out of his pocket.\n\nAnyway, the kid is turning 2. They won't remember it. They can have a basic party, cake, party food, playtime doesn't need to be extravagant because again, hes 2 years old. Kids that age are happy playing with a roll of toilet paper, anything that makes a mess and anything that is brightly coloured or makes funny noises, and they'll fall asleep before its even time for the cake. Have family and maybe friends who have kids they know, come. There's no need to go all out because let's be honest, there comes a point where it stops being a party for the child and starts being a party so the parent can show off to other parents",

I mean, the girl turned 5... and you had booked several things (that she knew of - and maybo other that she didn't know of). How much were you actually spending?\n\nI think judgement may depend on this. Maybe he told you money was not a problem when he thought about snacks and cake for 5-year-olds, some games, maybe a clown... but if you went and rented the Disneyland hotel and the characters to sing Happy Birthday, he would have been pissed. OR maybe you were planning a regular party for a 5-year-old and he was being a miser. We can't know unless you tell us what you had planned.",
