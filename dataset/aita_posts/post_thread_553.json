  "post content": "Sorry for the length and vagueness and general going down a couple rabbit holes for backstory.\n\nMy bf and I have been together three years. We went to colleges in different states and agreed when we graduated we would find jobs in a big city in my home state. We both interned there and mine led to a job offer but despite them liking him, his company couldn\u2019t hire him at the time. He searched for another job there for a the few months before he graduated but I never felt like he tried as hard as he could have. He did not find a job there and instead took a job approximately 1800 miles away with the agreement that it was what it was and I would just find a job there since I graduated second. I interviewed a few places and found a job there after much searching. I gave up the job close to my hometown which was also a job that I really loved and was passionate about and moved with him. \n\nFast forward eight months, I hate my job and miss my family and he loves his job and doesn\u2019t want to leave. The company he interned with near my hometown now wants him back, with a 35% raise but he doesn\u2019t want to leave his job despite it paying less and he liked the other job equally as much. I think he is just comfortable and likes his team a lot, and the weather and surrounding area here. I feel for him but I also can\u2019t help but want to leave and go back to my job that I loved and was passionate about and the city that I loved and grew up near. We are software engineers and it is hard to get a job like that without connections. All my connections are in the other city and my family is as well. His family is in a different city but he hardly visits them even though he could, he has stockpiled vacation days but won\u2019t go anywhere without me. I have gone to visit my family and they\u2019ve visited me a couple times and I really miss them so it seems like that\u2019s a higher priority for me than for him. \n\nFrom my perspective, it seems like he won\u2019t give up a great job for another great job that pays more, leaving me with a job I hate instead of a job I love. On top of, he would rather stay in a place he likes the weather and surrounding area where neither of our families are, rather than an equally nice place but he likes slightly less where my family is. It hurts even more because I gave up a job I loved originally for a job I knew I wouldn\u2019t like so that I could live with him, on the assumption that he couldn\u2019t get a job in the other city and now I feel he won\u2019t do the same. So AITA for wanting him to take the job?",

You try and belittle this as best you can in the post but it's clear that your boyfriend must really like his current job if he is willing to ignore a 35% pay increase. You aren't an asshole necessarily for wanting him to move back to your hometown but there is a lot of me me me in this post while you attempt to completely negate his feelings. \n\nNAH",

There are many more pros to going back to your home state versus pros of staying where you are. You are two individual people with your own passions and career goals, but you are also a *team*. Yes, we ARE only hearing your side, but the fact he loved both jobs AND he\u2019s being offered a raise seems to show moving states is the better decision. Right now he\u2019s just comfortable and likes the weather - that\u2019s not a good enough reason to stay there when you factor in your circumstance.",

You have a right to miss him if he doesn't leave with you, but I don't think you are right to think of the situation the way you are because he is not making you do anything. If you stay at a job you dislike that is your choice, not his. He is happy where he is, and you can ask him to come with you if you want, but if he says no he isn't the bad guy. Worst case scenario- sometimes life just takes people in different directions. Don't resent him for it. Be happy that he's doing something he wants to do that makes him happy. It's ok for you to do the same for yourself.",

Yes I understand that you loved that job and your family is there but now you suddenly spring this on him and expect him to uproot his whole life to move back to appease you.\n\nI highly doubt he sought out this job which tells me that you did the footwork for him with the expectation that he would just say yes. You call him selfish yet that's equally selfish of you to push this on him without his consent.\n\nIn the same token however I still agree that it's foolish of him not to want to take it. A raise is a raise and 35% is nothing to laugh at. Add to that that'd it'd be a better opportunity for you and you'd be happier to be close to family knowing he would still love the new job. So yes he's being foolish as well which is why I'm going with ESH",
