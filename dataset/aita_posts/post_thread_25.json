  "post content": "We are doing some house renovations and so workers are in the house. Today two guys were putting up drywall in the living room while our babysitter is playing with our daughter in the family room while I\u2019m working in my downstairs office. \n\nI hear the drywall guy asking personal questions to my babysitter until her answers started getting short and her tone changes. \nIE: \nGuy: So where do you live ? \nHer: North of here\nGuy: Yeah but where?\nHer: It\u2019s kind of a weird spot\n\nThat\u2019s when I finally walked upstairs and told him, \u201cWhat is this? The census? She\u2019s watching my kid. Let her be. \u201c I thought I did it in a joking manner but I guess it came off harsher than I intended. My wife promptly informed me I was an asshole to the guy and the babysitter had it under control. \n\nI get that white knighting is a thing and that I may be out of touch with where I should be putting my foot down so I leave the verdict all of you. \n\nAm I the A-hole?\n\n\nUpdate: We spoke about the situation at just before she left. I apologized to her for the weirdo and let her know he won\u2019t be back. To quote her, \u201cThe thirsty ones never get the hint.\u201d\n\nThe most eye opening take away from this  was when she told my wife and I, \u201cIf you think that was bad you should check out my DM\u2019s\u201d. Her instagram messages are from people who should be put on the sex offender registry. Guys offering her $700 a week to hold them, guys she has never met offering to buy her plane tickets, and straight up dick pics. How are dick pic people not out on the sex offender registry? It\u2019s just street flashing with less effort. It\u2019s insane and it\u2019s apparently just a norm with the way she brushed it off. \n\nMy wife is deflecting from whether I\u2019m still the a-hole but I\u2019ll take what I can get. In her defense, even the babysitter noted that while my comment was funny, my tone was actually straight up yelling at the guy. It\u2019s a give and take like anything in this world. \n\nAnyway, thank you all for your input and here is to hoping the \u201cthirsty\u201d ones get a job which has them work from home and off social media.",

Both parents worked full days so I was home alone with him. He was friendly enough but started going extra. He would hover when I made lunch and ask about it. I didn't like it but whatever. I mentioned it to my sister who was married right out of high school and pregnant and due soon. She made an effort to hang out when she could. He latched on to her immediately. He stayed after he was done for the day, waiting for her to come by, made comments about being there for the birth etc. It was awful. We were only told by our dad to be nice and he's a harmless old man etc. My sister finally snapped and told him to back off. Our father was horrified and still to this day brings up how embarrassed he is that she was rude to that guy.\n\nIt took us both years to learn to stand up for ourselves. You did something for that babysitter and hopefully that was a lesson she learned. You can tell an adult to mind their business and be rude about it if they are making you uncomfortable. If they really didn't mean to, they will stop. Good on ya!",
