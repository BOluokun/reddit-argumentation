  "post content": "AITA for being upset that my sister always tried to take the spotlight\n\nI (23) have a younger sister (21) who has always been the spotlight of attention wherever we go. Before she got plastic surgery I would be called pretty and have guys who were interested in me, however, after she got her nose and lips done it\u2019s as if every man on earth has only eyes for her. Not only that but my friends keep talking about how beautiful she is. I know I sound jealous, because I am to a degree even though it\u2019s difficult to admit. I usually don\u2019t have a problem with it while it does suck at times. \n\nMy birthday is this week and I\u2019m throwing a big party with all of my friends and classmates from uni. This whole week long she has been telling me and asking me to let her wear a specific champagne colored dress to my party. The whole thing is casual, no one is going to dress up and this is a very fancy dress. Also the fact that this was my dream dress that I wanted to buy for myself but couldn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t have the money for it, and her knowing this bought it for herself. Now she wants to wear it and she keeps saying \u201cI\u2019m going to steal all the attention to myself at your birthday\u201d in a \u201cjoking way\u201d. She has repeated it 6 times over 5 days while I repeatedly asked her not to joke about it because it hurts my feelings. She keeps telling me that me getting upset at her for making that joke is not normal and just shows how insecure I am. \n\nShe\u2019s not speaking to me now and said that she won\u2019t attend the party at all, I don\u2019t like fighting with her because besides this stuff we are super close and love each other. I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s just being an asshole or it\u2019s just me being insecure. Should I apologize? I do want her to come to my party and have fun together I\u2019m just not sure how to tackle this.\n\nUpdate; My sister came crying to me this morning saying that she doesn\u2019t want to fight and that she understands why I got upset. We talked about how this was brewing for a while now because of smaller issues building up. She assured me that she would never wear that dress because that would be embarrassing and mean but that she was just trying to annoy me like sisters do and it got out of hand. I want to thank everyone for their kind advice, especially the ones with siblings who put it more into perspective! We had a really good talk and we\u2019re planning the party together now :)",

Odds are you're still pretty. \n\nOdds are also strong that you were feeling unthreatened and more confident before she got her plastic surgery. \n\nSo, **ESH**. I think you need to talk to your sister about your feelings and hers. I'm certain she felt overshadowed by you and that's contributing towards her actions now, I'm also certain you're probably feeling less confident and that's radiating off of you, which only adds to your perception she's stealing the spotlight.",

I don\u2019t care about her being annoying as much as the fact that she tries to gaslight me into believing that I\u2019m the weird one and insecure for being annoyed. This is supposed to be my birthday but now I\u2019m dreading it because of her, sisters aren\u2019t supposed to do that. But at the other hand I do admit that I\u2019m jealous at times, so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s also my fault argument wise.",

Then change the topic to something completely different. \n\nYou reacting is what keeps it interesting to her. Don\u2019t react at all, and she may realize her old tactic for upsetting you isn\u2019t working. If nothing else, you ignoring her will frustrate her. If she gets worked up, just give her a look and walk away. Ignoring someone who\u2019s acting up wanting attention, depowers them in turn. You ignore kids having a temper tantrum. Ignore your sister when she acts up too.",

I know you say she is your sister and you two are close but think long and hard here, she puts you down, compares herself to you, buys your dream dress for herself, gets plastic surgery, are you sure that you two are close or is she really just pretending to be close to keep you around so she can keep \"winning\" whatever competition she thinks the two of you are in.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't bring any boyfriends around your sister because I wouldn't put it past her to try and steal them for herself to win again.\n\nOP, please think long and hard because it sounds like your mum isn't the only one putting you two into a competition against eachother.",

      "content": "NTA - Her \"joking\" that she is going to steal all of the attention once would have been fine. Not a funny joke, but whatever. Her repeating it several times, even after you asked her to stop, is her purposefully trying to get a reaction out of you. Same with her buying a dress she knew you wanted and then going on and on about wearing it to your party. And same with her now giving you the silent treatment. She wants you to feel guilty so you beg her to attend the party. Or she wants you to ban her from the party so she can play the victim and tell everyone how jealous and insecure you are. She would probably fine with either outcome.\n\nShe sees attention from others as a competition she is in with you and she is not going to be happy until you acknowledge that she \"won\". She probably has some pretty deep rooted insecurities and thought getting the attention she is now would make those go away. But it hasn't, so now she thinks she needs your attention/acknowledgment. She probably isn't getting the big reaction to her new look that she was getting initially so she is trying to create drama/interest to get some of that level of attention from other back. She is chasing external validation when what she needs is to learn to be happy/confident with herself. \n\nYou are not obligated to play into your sister's games and bids for attention, especially when the ways she is doing this is making you feel bad and you have told her that. \n\nWait your sister out. Right now she is still invited to the party and she can't claim otherwise. You do not need to beg her to come. I am guessing she will eventually say something to you like \"you don't even want me there\" - just say \"of course I want you there, but it is entirely up to you if you want to attend\". Don't engage further than that. \n\nIf she starts up with the \"jokes\" about stealing all of the attention again, just say \"that's a weird thing to do at someone else's birthday party\" or \"ok, that's fine\". \n\nAs for the dress. If she wants to wear a fancy dress to a casual party. Let her. This is all about getting attention for her. She either gets it by wearing the dress or she gets it by telling everyone you wouldn't let her wear it. Don't let her manipulate you into being part of that narrative. If she asks about the dress again, just say \"its a casual party and you will be dressed fancier than most people, but wear whatever will make you happy\". Believe me, she may get attention for how beautiful the dress is at the beginning, but eventually people are going to be wondering to themselves why she is so dressed up.",
