  "post content": "I was in a horrible relationship with a woman I'll call Christi. She was a very toxic person and at best a borderline alcoholic. I hate to armchair diagnose, but she is spot on for BPD. Constant paranoia about everyone and everything, wild mood swings. I realized I had a problem and needed to cut ties with her to move on and fix myself and that's when she announced that she was pregnant. She stopped drinking while pregnant, but her behavior didn't really change, if anything, it got worse. \n\nI blocked her for a few months after there was a particularly bad incident that made me relapse, but I had every intention of being there for my child and made sure she knew that. When she would have been 8 months pregnant, a mutual friend called me and said she had had a stillbirth. I had no reason to not believe that friend but I just couldn't risk seeing her again and getting sucked back in, so I texted her condolences and have kept her blocked in every way that I could since. \n\n8 years have passed. I married my wife 2 year ago, we have a child, and I just passed 7 years sober. I went back to visit my parents last July (same town), and saw some old friends, some of whom would have known Christi. One mentioned that Christi's daughter just had her postponed birthday party. Her 8th birthday party, ie this kid would have had the exact due date as Christi's \"stillbirth\". AKA, she had my child. \n\nChristi married some guy, had two more children and had him illegally adopt my daughter. I now want to sue her to overturn the adoption because she clearly had someone lie to me so I wouldn't try fighting for my parental rights. I'm devastated that she stole so much time from me and I want my child to know her family and likely be in a safer, more stable home. My mother is telling me not to because people can change and it would be confusing for her at this point, but I think I should.",

Meanwhile, HE was a drug addict/alcoholic that was constantly drifting in and out, blocking her and then unblocking her then blocking her again, all while relapsing with his drug of choice and, by his own admission, \"Having a hard time.\" Was her paranoia/toxicity her asking if he was using? Was she wondering where he was when he was out getting blasted? Was the \"toxicity\" her getting upset while she was pregnant and he was off blowing all his money while relapsing?\n\n\nFrankly, I don't blame her. If I'd gotten pregnant by a dude that was an addict, who was constantly in and out and fighting with me, who said, \"I promise I'll be there,\" but then blocked you on everything...I'd do what I needed to do to get rid of him too. It's quite possible she was scared of him. \n\n\nShe's happily married with three kids, and yet he's assuming that HE is the more stable household? Why? He \"doesn't believe she could have changed\" but wants everyone to believe HE has; yet HE was an addict who abandoned his pregnant girlfriend while on a bender and then didn't give a shit when their child \"died.\" Now he wants to rip a child from her stable home life because he feels disrespected...he views the kid as his rightful property, not a living person that he is going to try and damage with this shit.

And NOW he wants to be in the child's life? When he never did any sort of investigation into whether or not she was actually born?

I have no doubt he had the best intentions for his child, but I can\u2019t imagine how horrible the idea of spending time with your abusive ex, when there is seemingly no reason to.\n\nAnd if she IS as bad a woman as OP claims, I do feel like it might be worthwhile him at least trying to have some involvement, as he might be able to be a positive influence on her. Perhaps she HAS changed, but if she is STILL an abusive borderline alcoholic... then that kid likely needs help. And to be fair, I do feel the kid has the right to know who her birth father is, even if she doesn\u2019t want to get to know him or spend time with him. \n\nI\u2019m not going to call a judgement, because it\u2019s *probably* E S H, but I don\u2019t feel we have enough stuff here to know. And there is a lot that OP will only find out by challenging the adoption and spending some time with his daughter. I don\u2019t feel OP would be TA for challenging the adoption, so long as he follows his daughters wishes and doesn\u2019t try to force 50/50 custody or the like immediately. Supervised visitation or perhaps the occasional weekend stay, until the daughter can have her own input on the situation though, I would fully support, because as I and OP have said, if that woman is as bad to her kid as she was to OP (or even, as bad to her current partner as she was to OP *in front of* OP\u2019s daughter) then somebody needs to be there to try and help the poor girl, and imo that would be OP\u2019s job.",

If Christi's pregnancy had continued as normally, OP had no way of being contacted anyway and I doubt he was going to be as involved as he claims, because someone who wanted to be involved would probably look further into the death of their child (idk that's just my opinion). He doesn't seem like he would be that much of a positive influence, as he hardly talks about what the child may want, just about his ex, how he's changed, and all these big assumptions that her home life must be terrible, because of who his ex used to be when he knew her.",

Like, part of the whole thing with BPD is a distorted sense of self, I.e. a negative self image.   Any destructive behavior I\u2019ve had was... to myself.  People with mental illness and personality disorders are far more likely to be VICTIMS of abuse than the perpetrators.  Like.  Of course I would end up in an abusive relationship, my negative self talk tells me I deserve it.   The worst I\u2019ve done to others is not even in my actions, but my words.
