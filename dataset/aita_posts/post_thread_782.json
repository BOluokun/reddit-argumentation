  "post content": "Okay, I know the title makes it sound like I'm some kind of monster, but hear me out! (Throwaway account btw)\n\nA little background; I'm a teenage girl with two parents who had been together for 31 years. Exactly 1 month ago my mom found out that my dad had been cheating on her with some random woman for over a year(!) She threw him out of the house within 2 days and packed all of his belongings. Now it's just the two of us at home, but I still have contact with my dad. \n\nSo obviously, my dad is feeling very embarrassed and guilty (as he should), and he's trying to be as kind as possible so as to not upset me or my mom even more. He knows he won't ever get on my mom's good side again, so he's trying with me. \n\nI'm taking advantage of his weak state, not because I want to punish him, but because I feel like I deserve it. He's made me suffer so much, it's only fair he pays me back for the damage he's caused to out family. And it's not like I'm sucking all his money out of him, he has plenty more than mom and I do! \n\nI guess my question is.. AITA for taking advantage of my dad and making him give me tons of money and gifts? \n\n\\*sorry of this doesn't include enough info.. I hope it's enough",
