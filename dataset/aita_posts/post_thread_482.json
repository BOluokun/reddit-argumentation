  "post content": "Would I be the a-hole if I didn't want to participate in donating the equivalent of 5-10 $, each time coworker has a birthday?\n\nFor context, I ( 31M) got hired 3 weeks ago in this firm with around a hundred employees in my department, and ever since I have been asked to donate money for six colleagues. I barely know those people, so to me it simply does not make sense to chip in for basically strangers!\n\nThe environment there is your typical \"we're a family\" environment and they will surely think I am not a team player, and start treating me like an asshole, they believe that five to ten dollars is not a big amount.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time there is someone's birthday, or someone is having a baby, or it's women's day,  there is usually food and drinks. I am okay with not indulging from now on in whatever they bring, especially since I don't want to eat unhealthy food and I usually go to work with my own food. But I think they will feel that they don't have a guarantee I am not going to do that since the food and drinks are going to be there for grabs.\n\n\n\n\n\nI do not want to do this anymore as I haven't even received my first paycheck yet, and it feels somewhat like extortion, to be honest. I know it's not a lot of money, but I feel like it's not fair towards me. Not to mention I had to commute and pay for gas with basically no money. I work here to make money, not to lose money.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI nearly had a vein pop in my head today when a colleague came to me and said: \" Hey, you need to give money for the flowers on women's day\", without any heads up, this time being like 20 $. I don't usually carry cash with me, so I didn't give him anything.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't want to pay anymore just because Becky form accounting has a birthday, or she is having a baby, or God knows what else.\n\n\n\n\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to pay for strangers' gifts?",

You will stake your claim to being an outsider. Your choice. \n\nI've worked in places that were similar and yeah, it does feel like extortion to an extent. One place even had a rule whereby you'd bring cakes in for everyone on your own birthday (?!) I don't even like cakes that much! I just kept my birthday quiet  never brought cakes in, and I don't think anyone noticed.",
