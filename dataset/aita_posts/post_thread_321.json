  "post content": "My fiance, Kevin(M28) and I(F30) had initially planned to get married a few years ago but due to the fact that the world was falling apart we postponed it until things calmed down and our family felt safer at a big event. We've now set a date for this coming August and as we get closer more and more thoughts keep coming to me about how it should go. My biggest issue is that Kevin's best man is no longer his best man and is now his best woman. Kevin and Amy(MTF26) have been friends for a little over a decade and when they first met up until two years ago when our wedding was supposed to happen Amy identified as a man. Kevin and Amy have always had a very close almost sibling like relationship, Kevin had been kicked out by his mom at 17 and met Amy at work shortly after. She's been very close with him and he's told me multiple times that she is the closest thing he has to any family.\n\nInitially Amy had planned to not come out to Kevin until after the wedding but after finding out that the wedding was going to be delayed she came out to him. Without consulting me Kevin told her that he was fine with all of that and that if she was at a stage were she'd like to wear a dress when our wedding happened that he would find her a dress that matched the colors he had for his groomsmen. Amy has been medically transitioning for about a year or less now and Kevin told me that we need to find her a dress. I don't have a problem with Amy and I understand how close she is to Kevin but our wedding is largely for my very traditional family. Kevin has often said that this wedding isn't that important to him and that the only reason he's doing it is because it's important to me and my family. I know that my family would have a lot of issue with Amy which Im sure would bring a lot of unwanted or outright rude attention towards her. For this reason I've asked my fiance to choose someone else to be his best man and request that Amy attend as just a guest. This has lead to a large fight between the two of us with Kevin threatening to cancel the wedding if Amy can't be part of the wedding party because he wants someone from his family in it. Im trying to get him to understand the issues this will cause but I'm not sure he gets it. AITA?",

He is doing something that will make you happy (throwing away thousands of dollars on a party that only you and your mothers really care about) and he has one request. It's not unreasonable. \n\nIt's not your husband's fault that Amy transitioned after your husband asked her to be in the wedding. And it sounds like Amy was even willing to hold off on coming out so as not to overshadow. I get that she's going to take some attention away from you, but that's your family's fault--not Amy or your husband's\n\nThis could be an opportunity for you to stand up for your husband to your family--to show your loyalty. \"My husband is my best friend and one of the most important people in my life: Amy is one of the most important people in Kevin's life and that makes her very important to me. If you don't like that you can leave.\"\n\nAside from the fact that you might be pleasantly surprised by some of your family, what you're telling Amy is that she doesn't matter to you. She doesn't matter enough to be allowed to stand for her best friend; that her most authentic self is not appropriate for a major role in her best friend of ten years' most important day to date.\"You're allowed to come to *my* wedding but if you could please support us from the shadows. I'm doing this to help *you*\"\n\nSo you can support your husband and someone who probably thought you were a friend, or you can tell Amy and Kevin that you care more about the feelings of your distant cousins and mom's coworkers than you do of them\n\nYTA and would put money on a reddit update that this ended the engagement.

I try to empathize with her, and it pains me to know that some family wouldn't come to my wedding, and some would come and judge and whisper. \n\nI entertained sticking with men because maybe it would be easier..

So it's okay if people show their colors, because I want to see them. \n\nYour husband could nicely tell his friend to sit in the crowd.. to protect her from judgment and hate coming from your family members.

I almost hid myself for the same reasons OP wants to hide her husband's friend. OP, if you die on this hill. Then you are deciding not to be an ally of trans people. That is a choice that you can make. There are people who will support your decision and people who will be hurt by it. \n\nI encourage you to ask yourself who you want to be and who you support.

Your feelings are valid and you are who you are who you are attracted to shouldn't be a point of discussion and it doesn't add or reduce your value as a human being. What matters is how you treat others, your kindness and your heart\n.\nIt's not my place but I would suggest that you hold off the judgment on mom for a while because it could be an adjustment phase, especially because you were brought up in a very open minded household.\n\nYou see, when you have a child you kind of picture of what their whole life will be like, you have dreams for them and those dreams become your dreams. So when your child doesn't follow those dreams or change those plans sometimes it takes a little bit of time to come to terms with it. Just because we have those dreams for our children it doesn't mean they'll come true because it's not up to us to decide, it's our child's decision and we have to respect that.\n\nYou are your own person and are allowed and should follow your own path to be your authentic self. Still, it's normal and acceptable for mom to be sad, or even grieving the loss of what she thought would happen. Her feelings are as valid as yours, and she might need a little time to accept the new reality. Based on what you said I think she will come to terms rather quickly because she has so many friends in the LGBTQIA community. They'll be a great support for her and you.\n\nAlso, she might just be sad that part of the family won't accept your authentic self and you might be hurt and suffer because of their rejection, microaggressions and etc. We, mothers, worry about our children's happiness and hate to see them suffering and going through a rough time. When someone hurt our kids, mama bear wants to come out and start fixing things so she is probably thinking about the family members who might have an issue and figuring out a game plan. Her sadness, could have been \"how do I protect them if the family doesn't accept who they are?\". Remember she said some family members said they might not come if you marry a woman, she NEVER SAID SHE WOULDN'T BE THERE, because I am pretty sure she'll be there front row and center.\n\nTalk to your mom about her feelings and try to empathize with her, and in turn ask her to empathize with you. Tell her how her reaction made you feel. She can't read your mind and probably will need you to spell it out to her!\n\nBest of luck! Keep being your authentic self!",
