  "post content": "I had adopted my older son [7M] about 4 years ago after practically being the only \"dad\" he had around for another 2 years before that. Wife's ex was a POS who left her pregnant and struggling.  For all intents and purposes he is my son, and well he knows about his sperm donor but in his own words, \"that man is nasty, I can't believe he could ever be my father.\" \n\n\nMy parents were less than thrilled that I married a woman who had a child, but (at least I thought) they had adjusted in a short while, and when I adopted him, they also jumped into the role of grandparents. And things were pretty normal for about 3-4 years. \n\n\nWife and I had our second child this year, and at the time of announcing the pregnancy, my mom made an underhanded comment to me in person \"I'm glad you finally saw sense and decided to have your own child.\" I rebuked her quite hard and stated that I'm not going to tolerate any favoritism towards their biological grandchild in front of me, or my children. That she is free to think whatever she wants but she cannot state it to me, or my wife, or my children ever. \n\n\nWell, my parents didn't comply. It started with stuff like forgetting to get my older son a gift when they came to visit, to when outright a while back when we went out for a meal during their Christmas visit, parents stated IN FRONT OF MY OLDER SON, that my wife should pay the tab for her son. To avoid creating a scene right there, I went and paid the entire tab and paid for a cab to take them home, as I didn't want them to be in the same car as me and my wife. \n\n\nAfter we all got back home, I told them that they are free to use their room till their flight day but they should not expect any kind of service from my wife (she handles most of the food) and that they cannot see either of my children. It got me quite an outrage from my extended family, and for the time being I'm myself being low contact with them because the restaurant incident had pissed me off. They also attempted to pick my child up from daycare but I gave strict instructions to not hand our baby to anybody but my wife or me, so it worked out and they left within 3 days. \n\n\nMy brother is on mom-dad's side. I got comments from the trio where they said \"We should've NEVER let you marry her,\" as if it was upto them at all. Being the younger son truly sucks. Anyways, I am currently low contact will all family, and have laid out 3 strict conditions to allow visits again: \"1. A proper apology to my wife, 2. A proper apology to my elder son and 3. NEVER showing any kind of open favoritism again, this includes either buying gifts for them both while visiting or don't buy gifts at all, never making my elder kid feel like they aren't his grandparents, etc.\" \n\n\nExtended family and my brother make me feel like the a-hole for, in their words \"putting a kid who is not even his child before his parents.\" So AITA?",
