  "post content": "Throwaway bc my husband knows my acc\n\nMy (25M) husband \u201cHarry\u201d (26M) has been in bed with the flu for about a week now. He\u2019s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I\u2019ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.\n\nIt was my younger siblings\u2019 (twins, 9) birthday on Saturday and my husband and I were invited over to my parent\u2019s house to celebrate.\n\nOn Friday, Harry told me he wasn\u2019t feeling up to a children\u2019s birthday party, which is understandable. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to be around rowdy children if I was sick either.\n\nSo I decided I\u2019d go there on my own, bring over the presents, stay for an hour or two and be back home before dinner. To be honest, after spending days holed up in our flat taking care of my husband, I was quite grateful for the opportunity to get outside for a few hours.\n\nWhen I told Harry as much, he didn\u2019t comment on it but he did seem a bit grumpy afterwards.\n\nSaturday came and I drove over to my parent\u2019s house in the afternoon (they live about 20 minutes away). I left Harry with some painkillers, tea and tissues on the nightstand so he wouldn\u2019t need to get up while I was gone. I told him he could call me in case something happened, though. \n\nThe party went great and I got back home after about 2 hours without any calls from Harry so I assumed everything had gone well.\n\nHowever, he was frowning all evening and when I asked whether he was alright, he called me selfish for leaving him alone and accused me of not caring about his well-being. He told my I should\u2019ve stayed home with him instead of having fun on my own while he was miserable.\nHe has since been giving me the silent treatment whenever I tried to talk to him about it. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and I thought he\u2019d have calmed down by now but he\u2019s still sulking and I\u2019m starting to wonder whether his reaction is reasonable and I\u2019m the AH here.",

Perhaps it would be a shock to your husband to learn this, but there are plenty of people out there who will spend an entire week taking care of themselves! Even if they are sick! Sometimes, longer than a week!\n\nYour husband sounds immature. And I hope this is just an isolated incident.",

I know this is anecdotal, but my own aunt has seen an incredible difference in her own health because of covid safety. She\u2019s got a congenital lung issue (and they\u2019re INVERTED, which is weird & interesting) that makes her highly susceptible to respiratory illnesses. \n\nPre-covid, she had a standing appointment every 3-4wks w the pulm. because she was getting sick so often. She\u2019d have bronchitis and then pneumonia so often that I don\u2019t remember a time when she wasn\u2019t coughing or wheezing. \n\nAnd then people started masking regularly, over-sanitizing literally everything\u2026 and it stopped. People weren\u2019t inadvertently sharing the germs that didn\u2019t affect them anymore. She wasn\u2019t constantly exposed to the things that made her sick. \n\nShe went two whole years without a single resp. illness!! \n\nThere are soooo many more people out there like my aunt, who have benefitted from this strictness. \n\nAnd honestly? There are entire countries who have practiced this level of sterility for *years*, so the idea that \u201cnobody was like this\u201d is ignorant. \n\n(Also, you\u2019re right a 9y/o isn\u2019t an infant, but that 9y/o is presumably in school & could expose even more people if they get sick!
