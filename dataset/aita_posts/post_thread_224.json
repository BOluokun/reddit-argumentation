  "post content": "Throwaway because some know my OG account.\nThis was pre covid when this happened, but I still think about it sometimes.\n\nSmall backstory: My (23f) friend (25f) has her son and was gushing on him constantly as I knew she would. Around the same time I was able to buy a house for myself with two floors and a finished basement.\n\nStory: Me- Me, F- Friend,J- F's son\n\nSo about a month after I moved into the house I invited F over to have some girl time. She was also kind of hounding me about seeing her son, who just started crawling.\n\nF and J came over and were doing pretty good. We put J in the living room so he could crawl around on the carpet and not get hurt. F and I were drinking coffee at the kitchen table which was just above the living room on a slightly higher level, so F and I had an extremely good view of J and the room.\nWell, the basement door must not have been fully closed as I heard the door creak open. I looked over to see J had opened the door and was about to go down the stairs.\n\nI got up so quick so the kid wouldn't go down and I got to him just before he tumbled down the first step. The stairs were wooden so if he fell, it would most likely kill him. The event went so quick that F had to ask what happened. I told her and she immediately grabbed J from my arms. She looked him over to see if he was ok then glared towards me. \n\nF: What is wrong with you? Leaving the door wide open like that! J could have fallen down the stairs and gotten hurt! It would be all your fault!\n\nI told her sorry, the door wasn't wide open and that I truly didn't know that the door wasn't fully closed. That answer wasn't good enough though.\n\nShe then began screaming about how I knew she was bringing J over and how I SHOULD (not could) have put a baby gate up in front of the basement stairs. She then started pointing out everything she thought SHOULD be baby-proofed (stairs, outlets, cabinets, etc.) in MY HOUSE. She then asked me if I would let my children live in such a house without baby-proofing anything. \nI answered by reminding F that I was sterilized the year previous, so children were not an option for me anyways.\n\nF's yelling caused J to get scared and cry (poor kid), to which F blamed me for. They left a short time later, but it didn't stop there.\n\nI don't use FB, but apparently F made a post about me being a b**** and putting her kid in harm's way.\nA huge argument started between her family and some of our other friends who knew about the situation.\nOne of my friends (E) asked why I was the one who ended up saving J when it should have been F's responsibility to watch her own kid.\nE ended up getting chewed out by F and the people who agreed for her (only her family).\nMost of our friends called her out as having the right to worry about her child, but she shouldn't expect everyone to accomodate for her or J. Especially when it means bubble wrapping their house for her kid.\n\nSo now I am here. I'm an a**hole for not baby-proofing my own house when I knew a baby was coming over?",

She should have done a scan of the room and obvious potential hazards before putting him down for free-roam play.\n\nAnd her reaction in the aftermath? Outrageously inappropriate. Egregiously unacceptable.\n\nEdit\u2014 A couple people have congratulated me on my correct usage of the word egregiously. Do people generally not know how to use this word? It's probably one of my favorite words. I overuse it...but I never knew it to be one that was chronically misused?",

Taking my kids to visit family was exhausting when they were little. Oh you have all of grandma\u2019s nice china in a cabinet on the floor? And it glass front doors that don\u2019t latch and slide open easily? That\u2019s such a lovely display! (True story.) I can understand this mom being upset at first if she\u2019s a first time parent and didn\u2019t realize that you can\u2019t take a kid that age for a visit and expect a relaxing chat over coffee like you used to have. But after the first terrifying near miss you learn pretty quickly to always have one eye on them.",

A lot of our childproofing transfered over to dogproofing, just like our dog training techniques actually are quite applicable to kid-rearing. (Hilariously, my first grader's school just rolled out an emotional intelligence system using a stoplight metaphor to help kids identify when they're getting overwhelmed and need a break, and my husband and I laughed because it was almost identical to a stoplight mood-identifying technique we'd learned in dog training class a decade earlier.)",
