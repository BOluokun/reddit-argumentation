  "post content": "\n\nTitle sounds messed up, but I'll, give background.\n\n2 months ago I (F16) was diagnosed with diabetes. Yeah, it sucks, not going to lie. Ever since I was a kid, I was obese. I decided that since I'm earning my own money, I can buy my own healthy food. I'm saving also up for a bike. I walk/jog almost everyday and since I found out I had diabetes, I lost 8lbs!\n\nI was proud of myself. Not sure if 8lbs is good for 2 months, but I am happy with it.\n\nI told my mom with a smile on my face, and she said, \"Why are you trying to lose weight now? You already got diabetes. It doesn't even matter and you'll probably give up.\" (Not verbatim, but that was the jist and now looking back she was probably joking).\n\nWell, that made me cry and break down. \n\nA week and a half later, my mom announced to our family (at a birthday party) that she was going to quit cigarettes for good. I remember what my mom said to me so I laughed to my sister and said, \"no she isn't.\" \n\nWell, my aunt overheard and told my mom, and my mom came up to me, really mad. She confronts me and I said, \"you've been smoking for 12 years now, the damage has been done, why quit now?\"\n\nNow, I would never say that in private and I only had confidence because we were in a public area. She couldn't do anything to me, so she started to cry. Everyone called me an asshole for making her cry and ruining the party.\n\n\nI know what I said was fucked up and I didn't really mean it (I told her this afterwards, but didn't say sorry), so AITA?",

      "content": "First of all, congratulations on the weight loss! Eight pounds is a significant amount of weight. Go to a gym and pick up an eight pound weight. It\u2019s pretty heavy. You\u2019re addressing your health very intelligently and I\u2019m proud of you. About a pound a week, give or take, is exactly what a young woman your age should be losing and that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing. Keep it up!\n\nYour mother was nasty to you and she was also wrong. Diabetes doesn\u2019t have to be a life sentence. You can not only manage it but reverse it. Losing a lot of weight and eating sensibly is the way you usually get your blood sugar levels down. Since you\u2019re a minor, I\u2019m surprised that your doctor didn\u2019t tell her that. If you keep up your health routine, your A1C levels will probably be down significantly and may even return to normal level. So, your mother wasn\u2019t even correct in her little jab. If she was joking, all I can say is that she has a lousy sense of humor. Her job is to be a supportive mother, not a stand up comic.\n\nNo, you shouldn\u2019t have said what you did at the party but I see why you did it. Ignore everyone else\u2019s judgment: they don\u2019t know the backstory. \n\nI usually don\u2019t say this but I don\u2019t think you owe your mother an apology. It was good for her to get a little taste of her own medicine. Now that arrows have been slung on both sides, just let it go. Both of you were wrong so ESH. But, your mother was a lot more wrong than you were.\nShe\u2019s the adult.",
