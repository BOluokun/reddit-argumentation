  "post content": "A friend at work pointed me to this to get some more advice/points of view on my situation.\n\nI (46F) am the mother to two wonderful children, Andrew (16M) and Nicole (21F). Nicole was very bright as a child and excelled in her classes, and she headed into college with a plan to get a Master\u2019s at least. I never had to worry about her doing well or hitting milestones, but the last few years have been very surprising. She became a bit withdrawn in her teen years, more so than I realized until now, and after her first year of college she suddenly moved out from a relative\u2019s home and got her own apartment. Then, after her second year of college (last May) she told me and her father (58M) that she was dropping out and might return in a year, but wasn\u2019t sure, and that she was incredibly stressed and depressed and had been for years. It felt like it was coming out of nowhere. \n\nLast fall she got a full time job and started talking about how she was happy and finally in a good routine and that she loved working. I was glad things were at least going well for her now, but still hoping she\u2019d return to college soon. One of the biggest recent bombshells she dropped on me though was a month ago when I drove to visit her. We went out for lunch, and we started talking about this friend (25F) of hers. Eventually, my daughter admitted to me that she was a lesbian, and that she and this girl had been dating since January and that she FLEW TO MEET HER WITHOUT TELLING ME OR HER FATHER! Mind you, she flew over 1,000 miles to see this girl that she had NEVER MET and had only called and video chatted with for a few months. I was shocked and angry, but all I did was gently scold her for not telling me, but that I\u2019m glad she\u2019s okay and that she had a good time with her girlfriend. I\u2019m very new to this whole thing with my daughter, as I thought she was interested in men, but I\u2019m willing to support her because I love her. \n\nThe problem now is that she told me earlier this week that she intends to move within the next year and a half. She says it may be sooner rather than later because things are changing with her girlfriend\u2019s living situation and she wanted to give me a heads up. I told her absolutely not, that she can\u2019t move in with someone she\u2019s only been dating for a couple of months, especially not when she\u2019s moving several states away. All of her family is HERE, including me and her father and her brother, and her three living grandparents. I told her she\u2019s too young and she can\u2019t move that far away from us just for a girl. She told me that regardless of her girlfriend, she\u2019s been wanting to move far away for years and that her girlfriend\u2019s state was on a list of potential places. She said she loved being there when she visited and can\u2019t wait to go back. She says I\u2019m being unreasonable by asking her to stay and that she hates it here and feels like she \u201ccan\u2019t be herself\u201d.\n\nAm I being the a-hole here? I don\u2019t think she\u2019s old enough or mature enough to leave.\n\nEdit because someone asked- my daughter didn\u2019t ask for money. She almost never asks for money, she\u2019s like her father in that way. She\u2019s almost completely financially independent. I have her on my health/dental insurance to help her out, my mother pays her monthly phone plan because she insisted on doing something for my daughter, and my daughters grandfather on her father\u2019s side pays her car insurance, and my daughter goes to her father when she has car troubles because he has a lot of experience with cars. My daughter takes care of all her other needs on her own.\n\nEdit- my child\u2019s father is NOT my husband. We never married. We have not been together since she was born. I would have left him earlier had I not become pregnant. I regret being involved with him because he is why I was introduced and became addicted to drugs. I do not regret my daughter. Please stop calling me a homophobe. I support my daughter. I am just apparently ignorant to some things about being gay.\n\nEdit- I am no longer talking about or answering questions about my addiction. Most of you are making baseless assumptions and disgusting accusations and I won\u2019t entertain them. I tried my best to be a good mother and get clean. That\u2019s that. I may not have been the best person to have custody of her as a child, but neither was her actively abusive father who stalked, abused, manipulated, and intimidated me the entire time I\u2019ve known him.\n\nEdit 3/24- I can\u2019t keep up with the comments. I\u2019ve also been banned from commenting because I apparently broke a rule. I\u2019m going to try to talk to my daughter about all of this when I see her this weekend. I want to be a part of her life even if I think she\u2019s moving in the wrong direction.",

              "content": "Honestly, this just makes me sad. I suspect OP is experiencing a lot of complicated emotions about missing out on most of her daughter\u2019s childhood and having lost parental rights over her. It almost sounds like denial to me like she isn\u2019t ready to accept that her daughter has already grown up largely without her and is an adult now capable of making her own choices. I know people who tend to react to strong emotional situations with denial (my mom does this) so they can avoid all those feelings. Or perhaps this is triggering the trauma of losing her daughter in foster care and she feels like she is losing her daughter all over again and is trying to exert control to stop it.  Of course this is all speculation.  \n\nRegardless, OP\u2019s daughter is an adult now. And OP\u2019s job as her mother is to support her.  A 21yo adult, unless handicapped in some way, is fully capable of going on trips without telling her parents and she doesn\u2019t need permission to move in with her girlfriend. Many young adults younger than 21 live several states away from their parents for college or whatever. \n\nMy advice to OP is to tell her daughter that she loves her and if things don\u2019t work out OP will always welcome her back with open arms. Keep the line of communication open in case she gets in a bad situation and needs help. Be her safety net. Once your kids reach adulthood, your role in their lives changes to more of a safety net and support system rather than an active parent. If you are having trouble accepting this transition due to your own grief and trauma, then that is something you need to work through on your own without holding your daughter back.\n\nEdit: OP also needs to be aware that her daughter was likely traumatized by the removal and because of this trauma and OP\u2019s own drug and abuse history, her daughter is more susceptible to drug addiction and abusive relationships as well. I hope OP is prepared to work through these issues with her daughter if they arise. I do have concerns about a depressed young adult moving so far away to live with someone they\u2019ve only met once, but all you can do is be there for them if things turn sour.",

From your original post, without the additional context provided, it's clear she was the kid you didn't have to worry about. Trust she's still that person. She might mess up or make mistakes, but she needs to figure them out for herself and have her own process.\n\nWhen I was 21, my internet boyfriend came to live with me. On our third trip to see one another, we got matching tattoos (as was the way for suburban quasi-rebels in 2001). I still have the tattoo, but I did manage to ditch the dude. I was my mom's good kid. It must have been terrifying for her to watch me in that situation, but you know what? She stayed near to me, quietly supporting me, no matter what, and she never said a word. She gave me space and time to get some adult legs under me and figure my shit out. And when I did, she was there to help me move out of my apartment in under an hour. ;-)\n\nStay (metaphorically) close and let her figure out her own path. If you push, she will go further and further from you.\n\nEdit: grammar",

It was BRIGHT blue and I loved it, but I knew it was weird so I only painted my toenails so that it could be hidden in shoes for \"proper\" events. Totally normal and benign, right?\n\nMy mother hated that nail polish. HATED. She expressed that a number of times and I kept using it, because it was easily hidden nail polish on my toes so who the hell cared that much? So she pulled her favorite trick - shaming her shy, easily cowed daughter in front of someone else. When we were at a doctor's appointment, she started in AGAIN, telling the doctor that it looked like I had frostbite on my toes (what in the actual fuck) and trying to get him to agree and tell me that I shouldn't wear it.\n\nThe fact that she went to that bizarre length about *nail polish* will probably give you a hint about how she reacted to my partner being trans, or about me refusing to go to their culty church anymore.",

Was it a mistake? yes (but it was for ME, there are many people who moved out far away and it worked out for them). Did I learn from it? absolutely!\nSo, if OP is reading this, keep in mind your daughter is 21, probably almost 22, so an adult. She is basically financially independent, and she has the right to do whatever she wants with her money. She may accept advices from her mother, but certainly not a \"no\". I understand your concern, and there are high chances this might not work out, but at the end of the day this is her business, her relationship, her life. You don't have the power to order her to do or not to do something anymore, you can just say \"In my opinion you should...\", but don't expect her to listen to you. Let her experience things.",

I'm not surprised she wants to get away from you - when she says she \"can't be herself\" she pretty obviously means that you are way too controlling and intrusive (just as you're being here).\n\nWish her well, tell her you'll always be there for her, invite her and her girlfriend to visit. Don't try and run her life, it will completely backfire on you.",
