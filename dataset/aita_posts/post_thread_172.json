  "post content": "Me(24 F) has a cousin(21 F) who has a daughter(7 F) has always been self centered. She always thinks that her and her family are the most perfect family who deserves anything. I collect these little stuffed animals called Squishmellos that are very popular with kids, and I have a lot of them. This Monday our family had our annual Christmas Party, and my cousin and her kid came. Her kid automatically saw my squishmello collection as you could see inside my bedroom door when you walk through the front door. The first thing she said to me was \"Can I see your Stuffies?!\" And I wasn't going to be rude so I let her. She kept on repeting the same phrase \"I wish I had squishmellos\" but I kinda ignored it. She spent her whole time glaring at me and my Squishmellos as if she was mad or something. When it was time to leave I saw my cousins kid crying and my cousin walked up to me. Can't remember exactly what she said but it was something along the lines of \"Look, you have so many Squishmellos and my daughter has none so can you give her like 5?\" And I said \"no,sorry, I've been building this collection for awhile and I can't just give it away\" she SCOFFED and walked out with her kid. Since then I've gotten many calls from family that i am the a hole and say I should have just gaven her the stuffed animals. Am I in the wrong??",
