  "post content": "A friend of mine is a hair stylist and I asked about changing my hair from an auburn color to dark brown and grey bayalage. She said it could be done and that it would take a long time. When I asked how much it would be, she said we will work that part out and that we could trade... her doing my hair, and I would make her some jewelry (I am a silversmith).\n\nGot first round of hair done, went from the auburn to a light brown/dirty blonde. I was there for 7 hours, we had lunch, had some beverages and there was other down time while the product did its thing. The process was one round of bleaching then rinse and dry, one round of dark color applied then rinsed and dried, and then a grey color applied, rinsed and dried.There are 2-3 more sessions needed to get it to where I want it. It's no where near done.\n\nWe got together after and she chose some jewelry and put together some pieces I will make for her. I still owed her $200 in cash after all said and done.\n\nAfter she left, I added everything up and the total was $990. \n\nI was shocked.\n\nI asked her if that was for just one session or the whole thing and she said that was just for the first session and that it won't cost that much the next time around. She made a comment that I need to charge more for my jewelry in the future and I let her know I was being conservative with my prices and didn't charge retail....I charged family/friend prices. (All this was through text)\n\nI think that if your going to be charging your friend $1K for a service, that should be disclosed up front. I expected it would be like $300. Bad communication there, perhaps on both of our parts.\n\nHad I had known it was going to be $1K to do my hair with her, there is no way I would have gone through with it. In my eyes, that is outrageous and I do not have that kind of money to spend on my hair, and never would.\n\nPart if me wants to go back and say if she is charging full price, then I need to charge full price for my product as well and that the price of my jewelry has changed. Also that if she knew going into to it how much it was going to be (which she did say in a text) that that should have been disclosed and it was kind of dirty not telling me.\n\nThe other part of me is saying suck it up, don't say anything and just not go back to her to finish my hair. Lesson learned.\n\nAITA in this situation?",

One process routinely costs $200-300 depending on the location and stylists experience.

It gets so complicated that most stylists charge by the hour for a custom color like this.

But don\u2019t let her off the hook, she absolutely should have had a discussion with you about the price before she even touched your hair with color of any kind. If she took a detailed hair history, she should have had a reasonable estimate from the get go. It\u2019s not cool that she sprung it on you at the end like that.",

Balayage is expensive just in general, plus there's all the bleaching that needs to be done, and the fact that doing it right so that your hair doesn't get screwed up typically adds a premium cost.  \n\nI think it would be worth it to have a discussion with her (when you're calm) about expectations in terms of a trade and if she's giving a discount or not, and then don't give her a discount on your products if she's not doing the same for her services.",

It seems pretty standard for that long, color corrections can be even more expensive and take longer as well.\n\nI'm going to go with NAH, but it is important to ask pricing before major jobs like this take place, they could have given you at least a rough estimate of hourly charge(if they handle that stuff as a color correction and some do because it is that much of a pain in the ass) or even a normal price for the service with a side note of it can go higher depending on how your hair reacts/behaves.\n\nJacking up your pricing does seem a bit assholish after the fact when it was all just a lack of communication to begin with. Hair stuff is expensive.",
