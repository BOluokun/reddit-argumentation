  "post content": "This situation is complicated and I\u2019m at my wits end. I have 2 daughters who are civil to each other but don\u2019t get along with each other. My eldest is married to Steve while my youngest is engaged to Adam. Steve and Adam are so different they disliked each other the first time they met.\n\nSteve works part time because he treasures family time with my daughter. They spend their time traveling and exploring different parts of the states. He spends freely because he often say he can\u2019t take his money with him when he dies. \n\nAdam is an executive and for his side business, he owns several dozen properties. He works about 80 hours a week at both jobs because his philosophy is that he wants to make as much money as possible while he\u2019s young so that he can retire early.\n\nSteve thinks Adam is a corporate shill and basically blames him for everything that\u2019s wrong with society. Steve said that Adam is actively keeping people from buying homes and making them dependent on him. Adam thinks Steve is a slacker and have told Steve people like him who does the bare minimum but expects hand outs are what\u2019s wrong with society.\n\nNeither of them are bad and they treat my daughters well. \n\nI retired last year due to my health so Adam built a house for me so that I can live comfortably. I was able to customize everything in the house to fit my taste. Adam owns the house, pays for all of the utilities, and charges me $1 a month for rent. Part of our deal is that no one else can live in the house but me. He was very clear about this.\n\nSteve recently lost his job so he and my eldest are living off of her single income. As you can imagine, they are struggling. My eldest recently called me crying because their savings are almost gone and they can\u2019t make next month\u2019s rent. She asked if she and Steve could move in with me until he finds another job. I live on a fixed income so I don\u2019t have money to set them up in another apartment. She\u2019s my daughter and I couldn\u2019t let her be homeless so I let Steve and her move in. I gave them strict rules and a time limit on when they had to move out. I didn\u2019t think my youngest and Adam would find out because they live in another state but somehow she found out. She called and screamed at me last night for betraying Adam\u2019s trust but I argued that I\u2019m a mother to 2 daughters and I can\u2019t let one be homeless. I told her about the rules and time limit and begged her not to tell Adam. She hung up on me so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\n\nI know I went back on an agreement but I had a good reason.\n\nEdit\n\nI couldn\u2019t add many details in my original post because I was afraid of going over the character limits. \n\nAdam pays the taxes and utilities on this house but because it\u2019s the only house he has in this state, he keeps its financials separate from the rest of his properties. Also, he doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the house. Instead, he gave it over to my youngest to take care of so she handles all of the bills and maintenance and pays them out of an account he set up. She noticed the increased utility cost which is when she called. \n\nWe just spoke again and I laid my soul bare to her. I knew I was going back on our agreement but it was to keep her sister from being homeless. We had a lengthy conversation and in the end, she agreed not to tell Adam. She\u2019ll cover the increased utility cost out of her own pocket so he won\u2019t notice it. In exchange, her sister and Steve will have 3 months then will have to move out. I originally told them they had 6 months. \n\nI\u2019m lucky to have such a compassionate daughter. Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Some of the comments were very hurtful but some were helpful. You made me realize I should have called my youngest at the start and asked. That would have saved alot of tears.",

I\u2019m sorry but Adam is doing you a favour by gletting you live in this house and he gave you one rule so he\u2019s not taken advantage of and not only did you break this rule but you did so by allowing the person who insults Adam to live there.\nYour daughter and her husband want to live by the values they have fair enough but they need to be able to have money to back that up. If by Steve losing his part time job they are in this much trouble then they didn\u2019t have the money to spend freely and go travelling to begin with.\nYeah you have two daughters but at the end of the day the person who owns this house has no obligation to house your adult daughter and her husband and honestly you so if you loose your home because of this then you only have yourself to blame.",

Or if she herself now recognises Adams one rule was ultimately to protect OP on her fixed income. \n\nYTA simply for not asking Adam since it's the only thing he ever asked after building you a house and managing all expenses and customizing the house for you. he has ensured your comfort in retirement at his personal cost.

Given how you describe Steve, I'm betting they won't be out by X date.\n\nETA: I have a feeling Adam set that condition because he saw this coming.\n\nEdit: Based on OPs edit how many people think Steve and sister will be out in 3 months? I predict we see youngest post in 3 months. \"AITA for not telling my husband that my sister and BIL moved in with my mom\" because hiding big things like this from your future husband totally never turns out bad, right?",

You are a tenant breaking a lease agreement.  What if he finds out in 2 months and evicts you?! Right or wrong, you are completely and totally financially dependent on your landlord.
