  "post content": "My daughter has recently turned 16 and, for a couple of months now, has been constantly asking for a lock to be put on her door.  She says it\u2019s to keep her brother out - who barges into her room every now and then to bother her - but I\u2019m not sure if the benefit is worth having the lock in place.\n\nI don\u2019t like the secrecy of her locking herself in her room and I\u2019m worried she\u2019s trying to hide something from me or that she\u2019ll take the opportunity to lock me out. I admit that I\u2019ve forgotten to knock sometimes but other than that I see no reason as to why she\u2019d need a lock. \n\nThe way I see it, it\u2019s my house and I am simply unwilling to have any locks put in anywhere. She\u2019s young, and doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s she\u2019s asking for.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i don\u2019t let her get the lock installed?",

Also they were very paranoid about what I did online because they fed into the paranoia that hackers were going to find me and abduct me or some other equally implausible situation.\n\nThat taught me to be extra sneaky. I felt like I could never trust them with secrets because they were always trying to see what I was doing, and I would always feel like I had to hide it. It wasn\u2019t even bad stuff, just me watching a YouTube video, or playing video games. Whenever they came in I would instinctually pause my game and turn the screen off or tab out of some music video, or put down the book I was reading because I didn\u2019t want to explain every minute detail of what I was doing to them to show them I wasn\u2019t trying to hack the planet or download anything illegally, etc. \n\nThis fed into my adult life, too, even when my wife and I were first married she would come in while I was playing video games or anything like that and I would stop the game or turn the TV off to talk to her until she left. Eventually she mentioned how weird I was acting and it clicked together that I had been Pavlov\u2019d into acting like that unintentionally by my parents.\n\nTl;dr trust your kids and let them have alone time without you feeling the need to barge in and check on them every 20 minutes.",

There was a hole in the door and my brother would peep on me well into my teens (he was also in his teens and old enough to know better) I thought it was a reasonable request until my mom said \u201cwhy can\u2019t your brother look at you? What are you hiding?\u201d So I started hiding things at my friends houses. Not even bad things like drugs. I would keep favorite books and clothes at their house and have them bring them to school and then take them back to their house. It was the sense of having something that was just mine that was important. Eventually I did hide bigger things from her (like my first boyfriend and several sexual encounters) I didn\u2019t tell her when I went on the pill, I didn\u2019t tell her when I would get sick. Once I had gotten a very small travel size bottle of (whiskey?) bc I had read it helped with a sore throat. I hid it behind my curtain bc for some reason it felt important and right to do so. She would tell me not to close the door when I went to the bathroom or showered and my brother would stand and stare at me. Later she wasn\u2019t told when I went into labor at age 30 or when I got married or when I had my second kid. Let your kids have some privacy\n\nEdit I figured out pretty quick I could shimmy out my window and pee in the bushes. I would do this to avoid going to the toilet so he couldn\u2019t watch me\n\nEdit two to answer some questions: my mom and brother actually walked out of my life, Ghosted I believe is the word, when I was three months pregnant with my son. Second pregnancy in my thirties. Yes they knew I was pregnant, no they have never seen him. I have slowly found some peace knowing they can\u2019t hurt my kids since they don\u2019t know where we are and changed my number. I still have a lot of issues to work out but I\u2019m not self harming anymore (yeah that was an issue and oh boy the shit storm that caused) so I am doing a bit better and am happier at least. \n\nYes I did tell my mother. Most I got was \u201cwell pull your pants over your knees so he can\u2019t see anything or wear a towel.\u201d I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing now, tbh.",

Kids get a lot of shit for saying \"I'm basically an adult now\" but a lot of the times they fucking are and they say that because they're getting treated like they're 12 - old enough to walk, talk, and eat but not make their own decisions.\n\nThis leads to two things. First, resentment. My own mother basically admitted to me she started seeing me as an adult after my first year in college. This led to a lot of arguing and fighting in the years leading up to that moment, and now I'm minimal contact with her. Second, underdevelopment. Just because they're your children forever doesn't mean they're kids forever. Treating them as such sets them up to be flung into the \"real\" world severely lacking in personal and interpersonal skills like self-discipline and conflict resolution.\n\nYour kid deserves privacy on the grounds of she's a human, same as you and me. It's one of the more basic human needs. If you need the ability to barge in on her to ensure she isn't keeping secrets, you have deeper issues to figure out than whether your property rights trump her human needs.",

Iced me out like a mean girl.\n\nSecond time he walked in on me he mocked me mercilessly-like went to my family in the lounge room and physically imitated me.\n\nJesus, the more time I spend on reddit, the more I realised how fucked some of my personal experiences have been.\n\nEdit-woah to the volume of comments. Yes, sadly it is my real life experience and it\u2019s just the tip of the weird iceberg.  \n\nThough if you asked me, I\u2019d still characterise my childhood as happy. It\u2019s only in realising how fucked up it was that I realise how our family dynamic was distorted around our parents constantly competing, arguing and power tripping.\n\nAs for violating my dad\u2019s privacy, retaliating and playing dirty has never worked with them because I *really*!don\u2019t enjoy their tactics and also I usually just get name called, etc for being vulgar, rude, etc etc. \n\nAdditionally, my folks were near to nudists when we were young so there was no shaming to be had.  \n\nAnd yeah, my brother was and is treated completely differently as the golden child. \n\nI have definitely discovered the concept of narcissists (thank you for the suggestion \ud83d\ude42) after some therapy for an unrelated traumatic event.\n\nStrangely, getting some outside perspective from that therapist was really beneficial so that\u2019s kind of the silver lining of the trauma imo.\n\nAnd yes on the Stockholm thing. Every time I think I\u2019m out, they pull me back in. It has so deeply impacted my perceptions of everything. Just when I think I\u2019m done working through something, I realise there is more faulty thinking to address. I\u2019ll get there.\n\nTLDR infantilising your child whilst discounting and violating their personal boundaries 1) leads nowhere good for your child and 2) means you have some bigger issues you need to work on to parent in a responsible and compassionate way. \n\nListen up your daughter OP.  If she cannot expect and rely on *her father* to respect her agency, why would she expect any other man in the world to?",

I was also not allowed to shave or even go out. And still I got pregnant as a teen. And no she was not religious, my grandmother was like that with her. I also lived my teen years in Mexico, before that she was a normal mother.\n\nIt has been a hard year realizing that what she did to me was abuse, I moved out when I was 18 I'm currently 22 and went no contact 1 year ago when I got pregnant with my second child, I have kids to and can't imagine doing the same things to them.

How the hell would you like it if a family member you didn't like - especially a male family member - got to barge in on you at random moments when you might be getting dressed or anything, and you had no right to stop her?\n\n2. Not old enough? She's 16! Who doesn't understand what a lock is at 16?\n\n3. Here's the hardest part... Yes, as your children get older they sometimes will have things that they don't want to talk about with you. That's a NORMAL part of growing up and differentiating yourselves from your parents. I was pretty much a model 16-year-old - working at school, well-behaved, wasn't even dating - and I *still* did not want to tell my parents everything about my life, and I certainly wanted my privacy! That is normal!\n\nIt sounds as though you're having a very hard time accepting that your daughter is growing up and starting to have parts of her life separate from yours. And that *is* difficult; I'm a parent and I also struggle with it. But, I repeat... this stage is *necessary*. \n\nA good parent will accept it and will work on maintaining a good relationship so that their child will feel comfortable talking to them about stuff going on in their lives. Those are the parents whose children are *more* likely to be able to talk to them. Some parents are too controlling to handle this stage well; they try to stop their children going through this normal part of growing up. Apart from this being a rotten way to treat someone, it also backfires; it means they have children who don't feel safe or comfortable talking to them when there's a problem, and who are more likely to keep secrets and get into trouble.\n\nSo, the choice is yours; which type of parent are you going to be?\n\n(Books I can recommend: 'Parenting Without Power Struggles' by Stiffelman, and 'How To Talk So Teens Will Listen And Listen So Teens Will Talk' by Faber and Mazlish.)",

She was a straight A student, did extracurriculars, had a job and paid for her own car insurance and gas, had 1 boyfriend from her junior year on (spoiler alert, that\u2019s me), and was just fucking perfect all around.\n\nBUT\n\nShe argued with her mom constantly because her mom viewed her as if she was still 8, was constantly snooping through her room, wouldn\u2019t let her go out on the rare nights she wasn\u2019t studying, took her car keys away randomly and made her ride the bus, and just could not accept that her daughter, my now wife, wasn\u2019t hiding shit and wasn\u2019t up to anything, she was just a normal teenager.\n\nMy now MIL recently yelled at my wife, about my daughter, \u201cI hope she is JUST LIKE YOU!\u201d I said \u201cme too! I hope she is a straight A student who works hard, never asks for money, and becomes a doctor! That would make her the greatest daughter ever!\u201d MIL of course just talked about how difficult my wife was, because it has never occurred to her that my wife was difficult because her mother still treated her like a 5 year old when she was 16.\n\nMy MIL and wife don\u2019t have the greatest relationship now (and personally I fucking hate my MIL), so hopefully OP can look into his future and see he is damaging his relationship with his kid. She\u2019s growing up. If you don\u2019t learn to accept that now, it\u2019ll only get worse when she is in her 20s or 30s and you\u2019re still treating her like your \u201cyou\u2019re too young to know anything\u201d daughter and not a fully functional adult.",

It had double doors that clicked together so a normal locking doorknob couldn't be fit into it (after I moved out and my brother moved into my old room they found a way to lock it, but I digress). Still, it was never a huge deal, because people always knocked **and waited until I said \"come in.\"** \n\nOne time my grandmother was visiting us (this is rare, we see her for maybe a couple days a year), and she just barged into my room (as she has a habit of doing) while I was changing. What. the. fuck. Not allowing a lock or at least not consistently enforcing privacy rules makes a person feel unsafe in their own home. My grandmother was always like OP and that's part of the reason my parents went minimal contact. Now she's essentially a stranger to me, and her visits are something everyone in my family actively bemoans when she's not here.\n\nNot allowing people to have any private space is, I maintain, a mild type of psychological torture. It's used in both cults and boot camp for the military to break people down so they can be more easily controlled. \n\nYour daughter needs a space where she can just cry. In peace. Without constant anxiety about whether she's going to get barged in on and embarrassed more than she already is. Forget masturbating, and I don't really like that everyone's explanations took that route. She just needs somewhere she can turn off the anxiety in the back of her head and just. have. peace of mind.
