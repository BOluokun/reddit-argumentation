  "post content": "This happened last year but since it still gets brought up during arguments every now and then and I just discovered this Subreddit I decided to check what you guys think.\n\nMe and my wife have two children (15F & 11M). My wife is a stay at home mom since the birth of our second child. I (46M) work full time and earn a six figure salary. My job is highly stressful, requires me to travel a lot and mostly sleep in hotels. I only get to come home to my family on every second weekend, on average. Despite working a lot, I am glad to do it so that my family can live a comfortable life.\n\nLast year, I decided to buy my wife a Roomba for Christmas. My wife tends to be the one who vacuums the house so I presumed that she would like this present as it would free her of this chore.\n\nAs she unpacked the present, she was heavily offended and did not hesitate to show it, which made the whole situation quite uncomfortable as my parents and other members of the family were also present. She argued that 'this should not be a present directed at her but at the whole family, as it is the entire family\u2019s responsibility to clean up the house'.\n\nSince I work and am the sole source of income in the family and she is a stay at home mother, I think it is apparent that she should take on responsibilities such as taking care of the kids and maintaining the house. The gift was intended to somewhat relieve her of this burden. I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working. As cheesy as it sounds, I think that time is one of the most precious gifts and that Roomba would have definitely bought some time for her - time that she could use to do whatever she pleased instead of vacuuming. \n\nUnfortunately, one year later, this still often gets brought up during arguments, often coupled with her crying.\n\nSo, AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT: I should also add that I would have never gifted my wife a vacuum cleaner or anything along these lines. I saw the Roomba as a robot that would fully take over this task which is why I thought it was a good idea.\n\nEDIT #2: I asked her numerous times before Christmas last year what she would have liked to receive and she repeatedly told me that she does not want anything. I was left to guess and chose the most practical gift that I was certain she could be able to make use of.",

You saw it as something nice that takes a duty that she generally manages off of her plate. She sees it as proof that you view her as a glorified cleaning lady. \n\nI suspect that the Roomba isn\u2019t the problem.

I've had relationships end because it was expected that I'd give up my engineering career to support whatever my SO wanted for his career. And I just was not into that. I went to school for years for a reason. I picked my field of study for a reason.\n\nA good friend of mine just left her career after her second child to be a full time stay at home mom and she's seriously struggling with the entire thing. She's constantly posting things on Facebook that feel like she's trying to convince herself more than others that she's totally happy with this decision. She posted photos from her husband's MBA graduation captioning how she was so proud to play the supportive wife role and allow him to continue on his career journey. And she's constantly talking about how this is God's plan and when she's having doubts she just has to remember this role is just as important.\n\nI'm not saying it's not hard to be a mom. It's one of the reasons I don't want kids. But as I've entered my early 30s and watched women friends continue to leave their careers, careers we talked endlessly about pursuing while in college, it can be sad to see that given up when it's clear that they aren't 100% in for that. I know plenty of women who have wanted to be stay at home mothers from day 1 and that's absolutely awesome. It's when your friend talks about one day becoming a VP at Medtronic and then 8 years after graduating leaving her career to stay home and sell garbage MLM lipstick that it feels less genuine.",
