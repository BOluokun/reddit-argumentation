  "post content": "Just over two years ago,  I(f29) unexpectedly got pregnant and now have a beautiful 18 month old daughter, Ciara. \n\nOver that time my friends circle got considerably smaller but my best friend remained, Mia (f31). Mia doesn\u2019t have kids nor wants kids but she\u2019s been brilliant with Ciara.\n\nI\u2019m a SAHM and obviously don\u2019t have as much time to hang out as I did previously. Mia and I live on the same street (we\u2019re in Manchester, England) and it\u2019s a walking distance between our houses. I\u2019ve told Mia numerous times that she can just pop in whenever she wants to (she works from home) but she rarely does. \n\nShe did at the beginning but it\u2019s been happening less and less. Instead, she keeps suggesting we go out for coffee or pizza or even a drink but I don\u2019t have the time and always just tell her to come over and we\u2019ll have coffee at my place.\n\nShe asked if I wanted to go out with her and her other friends for a drink last weekend but I said that no but she\u2019s welcome to come over and we\u2019ll have a few drinks at mine. She said she already had plans and it felt weird to drink when she knows there\u2019s a child around. \n\nHonestly, I feel neglected. I feel like she put me on a back burner and doesn\u2019t want to be friends anymore. I\u2019m always available but she rarely comes over and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\n\nToday, I saw her photos from Saturday night out and I was fuming. She ditched me just so she could go and drink like she\u2019s 20 again. I felt rejected and horrible, I thought we were best friends but she clearly doesn\u2019t value me when she won\u2019t even have a few drinks with me at my house.\n\nWhen she finished work, she called and asked if I fancied going for coffee to town but I asked her to come over again. She said yes but before she disconnected, I heard her mumble \u201clike always.\u201d This really annoyed me.\n\nWhen she came over, I decided to be open about everything. And while not my proudest or most mature moment, I shouted at her that she\u2019s an awful friend m, that she barely comes over and if she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me to just say it and stop playing around.\n\nShe said she\u2019s always been accommodating but it\u2019s been 2 years and she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me when there\u2019s always a kid, especially now when she has to watch her language (Mia likes to swear).\n\nI said that she knew I had a child and responsibilities. And she said that Tom (my partner) could take care of Ciara once in a while so I could have a time off.\n\nThis felt really intrusive and I told her to mind her own business and not meddle on my marriage. \n\nI was really angry with her and kicked her out. She called me a selfish asshole on her way out.\n\nNormally, I would expect her to call by now with apologies but she hasn\u2019t done so and I\u2019m starting to wonder was I the asshole or was she? Perhaps I was too harsh and should\u2019ve been more careful with discussing it.",

She's not drinking like she's 20, she's drinking like someone who doesn't have a child.\n\n\n\nPS, she's right. Your partner can look after your daughter once in a while.

And we never get to talk uninterrupted more than 5 mins, as either one of the kids comes to her or she suddenly starts baby-talking to them. When her husband comes home from work, I get pushed to leave. The little bit of attention left for me is completely gone as soon as he enters the door. She even declined my wedding invitation 2 days before the wedding because it obviously was too exhausting to leave the house with them. (The kids were of course invited and we had other kids at the wedding too)\n\nIn the last few years, I only met her outside once, for a coffee in a cafe in town. But it ended up being a coffee to go and a walk in the nearby park with kid in a stroller/walking with us. Turns out she only came out because she needed to get a few groceries in a specific supermarket - which was near that park and cafe. After a round in the park she waved goodbye and was off to that supermarket. Ouch.\n\nI invited her so many times or made suggestions for activities- with and without kids.

I had no knowledge how often she was using me as \"the excuse\".)  In the meantime, my grandmother had been hospitalized for two months.\n\nMy friend needed her gallbladder removed and her surgery was scheduled for the end of September.  I asked her to text me when she was well enough so I could bring her flowers and do a few things around the house for her.  Instead, my texts were sparsely answered until a week later.  She calls me and tells me that she was driving to buy an outfit for her date with her guy.  I asked her how she was feeling, but I was rushed off the phone because she was going into a dressing room.  \n\nAdmittedly I felt pretty annoyed.  She could prioritize time with a guy, but not one of her best friends.  I took it for what it was worth and had to prepare for my grandmother's funeral the next week.  Calling or texting her felt like a lather, rinse, and repeat of, \"Well, I can't talk because _____\", so I just didn't contact her.\n\nAnd that's where we are now.  Things blew up with the guy and she was lashing out at me that, \"You changed, we used to be so close, I don't have any money because of [daughter's name]\".

I want to shout at them: *Of course they don't want to spend time with you when you don't exist anymore, your own personality, intrests disappeared and all is left is a childcare robot/slave.*\n\nSame with those who don't go anywhere without their kids: *your friends want to spend time with you and not with your kid. They are your friends, not your kid's friends.* Having the kid around every now and then is one thing. But all the time? No, thanks.\n\nIn my experience a lot of parents when you ask them how they are, they start to talk about how their kid is and don't say anything about themselves... *If your friends ask about you, they want to hear about you.*",

She objected to the Mexican restaurant I chose (a place she likes) which is renowned for good drinks because she didn\u2019t want to deal with an entree that has beans and actually said to me, \u201cCan\u2019t you just pick somewhere that doesn\u2019t have good drinks?

My husband reminded her that the dinner was about me, not her, and she could just ask for beans to be held. She was a moody asshole for the rest of the night because she wanted to got on the expensive sushi restaurant instead and we refused to budge.\n\nIn hindsight, that proved to be quite a preview of things to come with her entitlement and expectations.\nThe last two years have involved lots of \u201ctalks\u201d about what a lousy friend I am because of how my career and health have interfered with my commitment to her and the baby.\n\nIt\u2019s been two months since I iced her out and I don\u2019t miss her at all.

I think her expectations are super unreasoanble here and she's at fault for her own isolation/being left out.",

Your entitlement that she should always hang out at your house around your kid is wrong.\n\nAlso, yes, she can go out and drink like she's in her 20s again. Maybe you should try that sometime too, instead of insisting to drink around a small child which majority of the people are not comfortable with.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for so many upvotes! :')",

Otherwise OP is definitely TAH",

She just doesn't want to always have to do that and sometimes wants a change of pace and not be completely sucked in to accommodating OP's life. I could see OP being miffed if it was the other way around and her friend refused to ever be around her child, but it sounds like exactly the opposite.",
