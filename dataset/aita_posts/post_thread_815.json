We made the plans maybe five days ago. Tim and Sam live an hour south of the theater; I live an hour north of it.\n\nYesterday, I asked if they would like to catch lunch beforehand. They declined, stating they were going to Tim's parents' house today first, which is about two hours north of where they live.\n\nThe movie was at 4 PM and I left my apartment at \\~1 so I could catch lunch near the theater and do some language studying, a hobby of mine. About 2 hours before movie started, I texted my friends to see if they were on the road. They didn't respond. 45 minutes later, I texted again, and they said they were on the road, but would be 10 minutes late. According to Sam, they didn't realize that the town we were meeting up in was over an hour away from Tim's parents', despite being considerably further north.\n\nI arrive at the theater and try to buy my ticket at the kiosk. Apparently, you have to buy online, but there is assigned seating. I purchase 3 tickets for no less than $50.40 so we can all sit next to each other in the same row, texting Tim/Sam to let them know what's up. Sam asks how she and Tim will be able to get into the showing if I have the tickets. I told her I would wait by the kiosk. Then she informs me they'll actually arrive 20 minutes late, blaming traffic.\n\n20. minutes. late.\n\nAt this point, I'm livid. I talked to a third party and explained everything, and I was told my feelings were normal. This third party told me I should have considered the fact Tim/Sam have been late before for other events. (Funny enough, the ulterior motive I had for inviting them to lunch was to make sure we were all in the same place BEFORE the show, due to their chronic tardiness.) Even so, I feel you do your due diligence to arrive on time to events, especially if someone is waiting on you.\n\nSo, I wrote Tim/Sam in our group chat. This is unedited. Slashes for message breaks:\n\nI'm just gonna be real rn / Y'all gotta work on your timing / Like it sucks knowing I didn't even want to come to the dub but I met you halfway on that / Cuz I would have rather done the sub / And then y'all don't look up directions beforehand? / Idk / If it was the first time this had happened I would let it slide / But I'm miffed af rn\n\nNo response.\n\nBy now, it was a full 20 minutes past the start time. I thought to myself that if it got to be 4:25, I would start toward my car. Lo and behold, I'm in my car at 4:28, start the engine, and get a call at 4:29. \"Hey, we're here, where are you?\" asks Sam. \"I just got in my car. I'll forward you the tickets. Enjoy the show.\" And I hang up.\n\nFollowing that, Sam wrote in the group chat, \"So glad we rushed here\". To which I responded, \"Fuck your sarcasm are you kidding me / Rushed to be 30 min late lmao I'm dead\" No response since then.\n\nSo, there you have it. AITA for leaving my friends at the movie theater?",
