Sucks but we got most of our deposits back and refocused what we wanted. \n\nWe ended up having a small wedding of only the most important people (less than 50) which actually went really well. It was lovely. Until the cake cutting. \n\nMy husband\u2019s 4-year-old daughter from a previous relationship had cut the cake. My husband\u2019s mother had encouraged her/allowed it. They tried to cover it up with decoration but I could tell and I was upset. I held it together for a while, but after a couple of drinks I yelled at my mother-in-law, then my husband, and then unfortunately the child. \n\nTo be fair to her, the girl had helped choose the cake and so she wanted to try it before it got too late (because she\u2019d fall asleep apparently). \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Everyones saying I\u2019m TA but shouldn\u2019t they be teaching the kid some manners? Who cuts someone else\u2019s wedding cake first?\n\nEDIT: I defy all of you to have a four year old for several days an not yell at them. I love this girl, but really. Come on, Reddit.",

How do you see that making your relationship with her work? The kid is the victim of choices made by adults here. You had no business yelling at her.

That reminds me of all the entitled parent stories where the kid trust to take someone's switch under the reasoning that \"their mom said they could play on it\" and while this situation isn't as bad as that the mil is still just as bad as those parents.\nAs for the \"parent your step child\" part, it's normal for most step parents to leave the \"parenting\"(ie disciplining) to the ACTUAL parent of the kid.

It's a great loophole for abusers who get to lash out then say \"Well, I was drunk. Can't blame meeeee.\"\n\nFun fact: OP being drunk does not excuse this. In fact, it probably makes it worse. Most people who get drunk enough to think yelling at a small child is okay are also probably the kind of people who get very loud, very angry, and very scary to kids while drunk. OP is failing as a stepparent right now.",

Someone involved with the 4 year old was an AH no matter how you spin it, and it wasn\u2019t the 4 year old. And while it\u2019s fine to be upset at things, getting upset for the duration of your wedding that a child did (and they tried to cover up/fix) solves nothing. Instead of taking what happened and moving forward, something that is required in both a marriage and having a child now, OP let that fester to the point where she yelled at not one, not two, but three people during a time that was supposed to be a celebration.",

They should\u2019ve hired a nanny to watch her for the evening or paid a cousin or something. \n \nI can\u2019t tell if this was a case of kid left to wander around the reception hall helped herself to cake and grandma noticed, tried to fix, and deflect. Or if this is an evil mil who got a knife out and went to cut the wedding cake with a 4 yr old. (Which seems less likely to me, tbh)",

I was 4 at my dad\u2019s wedding and it was understood that he wasn\u2019t going to be my primary caregiver for the evening, but the village took turns keeping an eye (with the exception of the boring speeches, where I instead laid in the bathroom with my arms and legs in the air and whispered \u201cI\u2019m a dead bug\u201d to anyone that entered)",
