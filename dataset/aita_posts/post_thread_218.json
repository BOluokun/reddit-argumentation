  "post content": "Let me explain. So my little cousin lives about an hour away from me. Since he was a toddler he would always spend time at my house for weeks on end during holidays/summer. I am gonna be honest here, my cousin has a reputation of TERRIBLE behaviour. (for example, he ran up to my father and head butted him in the hip, 2 weeks after hip surgery when he was 4). As he got older his behaviour hasn't changed. My aunty (his mom) constantly calls me and complains about how rude, obnoxious, and inconsiderate he is all the time. I'll give a few main examples.\n\n1. He shits and doesn't flush the toilet, regularly. He's done it at my house and its disgusting. His response every time is \"my bad, i forgot\"\n2. He is extremely greedy. He will eat a pound of wings to himself that is meant to be shared without any thought that people around him are supposed to have some. Again, he's done this at my house multiple times and its pretty frustrating after coming home from a long day of work\n3. He is EXTREMELY LOUD when he plays video games. Loud to the point where the tenants who lived in his moms basement were forced to move out because they couldn't sleep at night. His response was that he didn't care.......he also does this at my house.\n4. Most of the times he will only talk to you if it involves him getting something (food, a gift, a favour). Other than that he will be in his room.\n5. He is extremely messy. He ate a plate of chicken at my house and literally left bones on the table. I walked in on him picking his nose and rubbing it on my bed (at 16 years old, not 6). Also, read my first point again.\n6. He destroys my wallet. He has his own money but when he comes over he views it as all inclusive or some shit. Always wants to eat out, always needs a new hoodie, always needs to get some expensive objective finished (last year i took him to get his drivers license, and he failed the test)\n\nIf my cousin was well behaved, I would love to have him over all the time. Sadly it isn't like that though. It's to the point where I dread the idea of him coming here, and tbh it makes me pretty sad.\n\nNow here is where it gets tricky for me. Recently his behaviour has been even worse, to the point where his mom asked him to go live with his father for a few weeks (they divorced 3 years ago). SO NOW that time is approaching for him to go back home with his mum, she calls me asking \"ohhh, can you please come and pick him up so that he can stay at your place for two weeks?? I feel bad for him\"......BRUH feel bad for WHAT?? SHE KNOWSSSSSS THAT HE DOESN'T BEHAVE HERE AS WELL, HE NEVER HAS. So the question I have here is ----\n\nAM I THE A-HOLE FOR NOT WANTING THIS ILL-MANNERED, TERRIBLY BEHAVED YOUNG MAN AT MY HOUSE FOR 2 WEEKS?\n\nEDIT: HERE'S SOME EXTRA INFO THATS PROBABLY IMPORTANT. YES I live at home with my parents....PAYING MORTGAGE, PAYING BILLS, DOING GROCERIES, MAINTAINING THE HOUSE, DRIVING BOTH OF MY ELDERLY PARENTS TO AND FROM APPOINTMENTS (because I am the only one at home who drives). My parents are at the age where they have given responsibility of the home to ME. ",

My neighbor's other kids were kind, respectful, with good manners. They grew up to be good, hard-working folks in various careers. But one of thier kids? He was just... something was very, very wrong from about three years old onwards. He was very cruel towards other kids and animals. Eventually, after harming his siblings too many times and killing thier pets, he was sent to some sort of group home situation, because he was just getting worse and worse. Everyone was scared to live with him and he'd threatened to kill them and had even tried more than once. These parents had tried EVERYTHING you could think of. Tens of thousands on therapists and every medication and behaviorist. He just took joy in hurting others and would plan things for weeks in advance to be cruel \"pranks\". I don't believe there was ANYTHING more the parents could have done to change him. I believe he's in prison, last I heard.\n\nCases like these happen. It's not the parent's fault every time.",

If they stop caring, and refuse to let you engage with them, your options rapidly shrink towards zero. Or to put it simply: You can have a child that is incorrigible.\n\nLet's take an example. The child decides they want to leave the house. Because you, uh, hadn't planned for that, the door was unlocked. They just wander off to wherever the fuck they were fancying. Their escape is noticed, you bring 'em home. Or rather... you try. They decide to do whatever it takes to not go home with you. \n\nHow fix?\n\nYes, the entire point here is that this is (a) an extreme situation, and (b) whatever you try to do, the child refuses to engage with you. There is no answer to this particular extreme, fictional answer without introducing something the child cares about enough to play ball with you.\n\nThere is, simply put, a limit to your power as a parent. And that limit is largely set by the number of fucks your child is willing to give. Recognizing that is important, if only to help you understand that you likely *have* power to take control of the situation (and without doing something abusive or otherwise illegal).\n\nThis isn't really specific to children of course. It extends to adults too. As an example: How effective will excommunication be as a punishment for a Jehova's Witness who already lacks family and friends, for example? A lot of the powerdynamic in the cult depends on being able to force compliance through others' compliance. If that falls apart the cult is quickly without the power to act.",

If cousin doesn\u2019t show, simply tell aunty to have a good day, and this conversation will only continue when cousin shows. \n\nWhen the call actually takes place, share a list with them of the behavior that excludes him from being in your home. Make it like the one you did above, only more extensive. Tell them both that until cousin can demonstrate exemplary young adult, socially acceptable behavior for an extend period of time (6, 12, 24 months-whatever you like), he is not welcome. Also explain that under no circumstances will you be teaching him to drive; that\u2019s the responsibility of his parents. He is old enough to understand his actions have consequences, and his parents need to know you\u2019re putting your foot down. Your parents\u2019-and your- needs must be your primary concern. If aunty tries to DARVO (deny, attack, and reverse victim and offender) you, shut it down.
