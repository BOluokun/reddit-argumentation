  "post content": "I (20M) am currently at my second year of university; I study physics and I absolutely love it! Anyways, a couple of months ago, Mother asked me if I was willing to tutor her friend's dumb son, who's in high school and struggling with physics. My schedule was full, but eventually I begrudgingly relented.\n\nI went there, we do our lesson, one hour of pure hell, and then comes the moment to get paid. The mum looks angrily at me and says \"Here's the amount me and your mother agreed upon\" and hands me 10\u20ac. I am confused, I clearly remember telling Mother my hourly fee is 25, but take the money nonetheless and walk out. When I get home, I call Mother to ask about it. She says \"She's a dear family friend, you should make an exception for her\". I roll my eyes, but agree, she's a family friend, maybe I should give her a discount. So, for the next month I tutor the offspring and I get less than half my normal pay.\n\nTwo weeks ago, we had to switch to online tutoring because of hardening covid regulations. I did what I had to do and before I closed the call the hag said \"BTW I will be paying you 5 from now on. Online tutoring isn't like normal tutoring! And he's not getting any better so why should I pay you?\" I was taken aback. I told her that this wasn't acceptable, and if she wanted to continue our lessons, she would need to pay me my normal (reduced) fee. She complained \"But 10 is too much!\" I couldn't hold it in: weeks and weeks of underpaid, mind-numbingly frustrating work bubbled up and I exploded. \"Listen, 10 is already nowhere near what I normally charge, you already got a discounted price just because my mother went over my head and decided that this was acceptable! As for your offspring not getting any better, I am a student with an average grade of 30 with distinction (in my country 30 is the max grade at uni), I am a tutor with dozens of clients who can vouch for my professionality and I have several professors who can vouch for my competence. I am not the problem; your son simply isn't interested in getting better! So, from now on, either you pay me my full price, or I just drop you. Be grateful I'm not making you pay me back what you owe me!\" I hung up and stormed out.\n\nMother called me soon after, yelling that I was rude and I shouldn't have made such a scene given that tutoring isn't my job and how bad I made her look in front of her friends. I countered saying that it doesn't matter it isn't my job, it's about the principle: I do something time-consuming for you, you pay me, end of story. She didn't listen and kept on berating me and wailing about her ruined social image. I hung up. Over the course of the last week, I've received texts and calls telling me I went too far, I should have just taken the money and not been such an a-hole. The only people that have my side are my dad and my girlfriend, who tell me I've done nothing wrong, but I no longer know if that's true.\n\nSo, I come to you, people of Reddit: AITA?\n\n\n\nEdit: thank you so much for all the constructive criticism (polite and rude both)! I just want to address something really quick: most of the criticism was for 3 things: I tutored the kid even though I shouldn\u2019t have, given the conditions, my perceived sense of entitlement and my use of the words \u201cdumb\u201d and \u201chag\u201d.\n1- you are absolutely right.\n2- right again, but I can only say that I was raised in an obscenely entitled environment (nobility, yay), it is only natural that I exhibit entitled behaviour. I recognise that and I\u2019m trying to get better, but shedding my entire education takes time.\n3- I never called any of them dumb or hag, I just referred to them in such way in this post. And, BTW, hag means \u201cunpleasant old woman\u201d (Oxford dictionary), which is accurate, and dumb is a person who acts in a stupid or foolish manner, which he did when he flat out ignored me when I was trying to help him, it DOES NOT mean the r word or is in any way an insult to his intelligence.\n\nAgain, thanks for the input and great advice!",
