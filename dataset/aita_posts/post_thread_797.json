  "post content": "Bf \\[20M\\] and I \\[21F\\] have been together for 2+ years now. I smoked before I met him and it was no secret that I did. He told me early on that he has mild asthma so I avoided smoking when he was around or just went outside for a cig. We never argued about this before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout a year into our relationship, I casually mentioned to him that I should stop smoking cause I knew it was bad for my health. Ever since that day, he would get mad at me for smoking. I actually stopped doing it for about 10 months only because I was tired of all the passive agressiveness I got from it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently started smoking again (which he knows; he was a bit disappointed but that was that). I don't smoke much, maybe 2-3 cigs again tops. It's usually in the morning before lectures while catching up with my friends. Bf and I usually meet in the late afternoon-evening, so by then the smell is mostly gone. I'm sure of that because he didn't feel it until a couple of days ago, when I smoked like 2 hrs before we met and the smell was clearly there. He was really mad and said some pretty hurtful stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today. We went and got dinner together. He's acting normally, except for the fact that he didn't kiss me when we met. Did the same thing yesterday but I just brushed it off and thought he was still a bit mad. Asked him about it and the conversation went something like this:\n\nbf: I'm not kissing you because you smoked today.\n\nme: I smoked like 8 hrs ago, what's the deal?\n\nbf: I just don't approve of this habit and don't want to kiss you if you smoked.\n\nme: So if I don't stop smoking, you'll never kiss me again?\n\nbf: Exactly.\n\nme: You knew I was a smoker even before we got together. How come it didn't bother you then?\n\nbf: In the beginning I didn't think we'd last this long. I didn't say anything about it for a year, but I realised that our relationship is serious so I changed my mind about the smoking thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't even know what to say to him. We went back and forth on this conversation but didn't get anywhere. He's not very physical as it is (which sucks for me because that's my love language) so this no-kissing-if-you-smoked situation is kind of a bummer. It wasn't hard to quit back then and I know it wouldn't be hard now, but I feel like he's being controlling and don't want to quit just because he's 'blackmailing' me into doing so, which just makes me want to smoke even more tbh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe thinks I'm the asshole for not making a compromise and giving it up and I think he's an asshole for the way he's handling this. So reddit, what do you think?",
