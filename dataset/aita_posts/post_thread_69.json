  "post content": "Me and my husband have a constant issue with him going to bed without having a shower. I\u2019ve spoken to him many times and stated that I don\u2019t want him to get into our bed without showering. Reason why is that first hygiene, second, he\u2019s a heavy diesel mechanic who comes home caked in diesel fuel. He washes as much as he can off at work but comes home and I can still see it visibly on his skin. He always makes the excuse that he\u2019s too tired and cannot fall asleep straight away after his shower. he most definitely does fall asleep straight after his shower! We constantly argue about it because I\u2019m so sick of washing the sheets every second day because of the stains and smell on them. He makes me feel as if I\u2019m asking too much and that I\u2019m such a cow for not letting him get enough sleep. \n\n(We have 2 kids, 1 year old and a 2 month old, I understand he\u2019s tired from work and then helping me where he can with the kids but it\u2019s just basic hygiene. I\u2019m also a clean freak and I personally shower 2 times a day because I hate feeling sticky after running around with my daughter). \n\nAm I being an a-hole for demanding he shower before getting to bed??\n\nEDIT: wow I\u2019m glad to see that I\u2019m not crazy! He\u2019s very unhygienic kind of person and I\u2019ve been encouraging him to be a bit more clean. When he comes home from work and doesn\u2019t shower, he won\u2019t get up in the morning to shower neither. He will wait till the next night. If I didn\u2019t hound him to shower, he wouldn\u2019t shower for a couple of days, trust me, I\u2019ve actually timed it as a little experiment. For the past few months, I\u2019ve been sleeping on the lounge while he sleeps in bed. Tbh, he comes from a very clean home like his mum is a clean freak but didn\u2019t teach her kids basic hygiene. He ever rarely brushes his teeth too, that\u2019s a whole different story that sings the same song! I thought I was going crazy seriously! Thank you all for giving some amazing advice!",

      "content": "NTA - While I understand that he's tired his not showering also poses a health risk for both of you.  Sleeping in or next to diesel fuel is not healthy.  Have you tried approaching it from a health angle?  If he still can't understand the concern, then it's appropriate to respond.\n\nHowever, it is rarely productive to tell an adult what they can and cannot do. Not \"letting\" him sleep in your bed may make him feel as though he's being treated like a child.  Might I suggest telling him what YOU will do?  \"I will sleep in our bed when you shower before going to bed.\"  If he doesn't, maybe you go sleep in the guest room.  Same outcome, but wording that is less conflict ridden.",

They say that people around the world now unknowingly ingest around a credit card's worth of plastic per month because the plastic molecules are carried up with water molecules during evaporation and are part of rainfall/snowfall everywhere and so they are in the soils where we grow foods we eat, no matter how carefully we choose our food sources. \n\nNot that I'm defending the mechanic here.
