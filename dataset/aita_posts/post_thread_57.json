  "post content": "So I had a baby some weeks ago with my partner to whom I'm not married.\n\nWe've been together a while, and I've given many compromises in this relationship. While discussing baby's name, we had a few disagreements on names but ultimately decided on a name we both liked well enough. The surname was a sticking point: he wanted the baby to have his name alone. I offered to hyphenate b/c logistically it's easier for the baby to have both of our names. He's been drinking the red pill cool aid lately - a large bone of contention in this relationship - and went off about how it's 'tradition' and 'the right thing to to' and 'his right as a man' to have the baby have his surname. He told me I'd be emasculating him and may as well be a single parent if I won't grant him this one little ask. 'My word is final - baby's having one surname'. This was late in my pregnancy and I didn't have it in to fight, so I told him that I understood what he was saying.\n\nFF to 3 weeks ago when baby's birth certificate came. He blew a gasket when he saw that I'd given the baby my surname. He rehashed the conversation above, saying I agreed to giving baby his surname. This is where I might be TA. I did nothing of the sort. I told him I understood him, which I did - but I never said I agreed with him. I told him there was no way I was doing all the work of making a baby for him to stick his name on it. When we bought up tradition, I told him it's also traditional for him to marry me before having a baby but he was happy to ignore that, I told him it was traditional for him to be the provider but I do that too - and I pointed out other holes in his logic. I told him trying to bully me into submission with his red pill bs when I was exhausted from pregnancy didn't work. He should have known better than to expect me to not share a surname with my child. He said the baby should only have one surname - they do. So why's he mad?\n\nHe went crying to his brothers and mother - all 'traditionalists' and misogynists - and now they're all up in arms.\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\n  \nETA \n\n  \nThere seems to be some confusion - we are not married or engaged. I don't believe in it, and he's never seen the point of 'bring the state into your relationship', so we agreed to never marry. \n\nHe's on the birth certificate as the father - baby just has my last name but father is listed. \n\nThanks for your feedback. I'll be asking him to come for a talk so I can plainly address the issues you guys have helped me see. Thank you for that. ",

      "content": "NTA. You told the truth and nothing more. If I read your post correctly, you agreed the baby would have one surname. You didn't agree to which one. \n\n So, why are you still with this guy? He doesn't respect you. He doesn't provide for you and the baby? Please don't say because you need him or love him. Needing him is like a fish needing a bicycle. If his family is of the same mindset, things will NOT get better so don't try to talk yourself into believing that they will. Go find someone who deserves you and your child or go it on your own if you can and want. Lots of women do. While it's true that children statistically do better socially, scholastically and generally otherwise with two parent families, your child does not need to learn misogyny, disrespect and selfishness which could easily degenerate over time to emotional or verbal abuse. You obviously don't agree with him on very basic, fundamental issues that are the foundation of a family. He can stay involved with the baby if he wants to--I'm betting he won't if you don't give in to his wishes-- but you would be wise to break off your relationship before it damages you and your child.",

And no matter how they seem, and their potential, that freaking red pill shite ruined so many men and so many marriages! I can tell you that even a year later, after I filed for divorce because of how much red pill/ alpha male shite he was throwing up, he changed his act around the house. However, the other day we were on the couch and he got some suggested content on his feed from no other than \"Hustler University\", so yeah he's still watching that type of shite, but acting differently hoping that I'll stay in a relationship even after the divorce is final. \nPoint is, don't cave, you're the sole provider and you're not married to him, so just break it up now, before the kid starts grasping concepts of family and stuff, as it's going to be heartbreaking for the kid and for you to watch them suffer if daddy isn't the same house anymore. It's easier to break up while they're still so small, and easier for you to get used to the whole motherhood experience, without his toxic ideas around you or the kid.\n\nBest of luck, and enjoy the little bundle of joy, they make it all worth it!",
