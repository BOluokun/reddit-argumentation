  "post content": "Hey all,\n\nI guess I just need to ask this cause it\u2019s bothering me a lot. It\u2019s a throwaway for privacy reasons. \n\nFor context, I suffer from persistent depressive disorder. I have random times of feeling very down about myself in lengths of time that ranges from one day to a few months. I\u2019ve done a lot to improve on my mental health and I\u2019m normal outside of these bad periods. That being said, I also haven\u2019t been the most open person about this to one of my best friends. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t care to tell, it\u2019s just a very deep emotional wound for me to talk about. Plus, she has also gone through a loss of someone close to her, and I don\u2019t want to have her worry for me causing more stress. \n\nShe invited me to her baby shower a couple of months ago. My mind was already slowly going down the rabbit hole during then and I felt it. And I told her the typical excuse of how I\u2019m not too sure if I\u2019ll make it cause I\u2019d be \u201cbusy\u201d but if I can, I will drop by. And unfortunately during the few weeks leading up to the baby shower, I was in a really dark place. The last thing I wanted to do was go and then bawl my eyes out randomly because I probably would. It\u2019ll ruin everything. And when I\u2019m in that dark place, I really isolate myself. So I didn\u2019t message her that I wasn\u2019t coming (I had thought I already confirmed I wasn\u2019t) or follow up with her on her pregnancy. I didn\u2019t message anyone when I didn\u2019t have an emergency or obligation. It wasn\u2019t personal at all. \n\nI totally understand that she feels like I don\u2019t care but I really care a lot. It\u2019s just hard to care for others when I don\u2019t even care for myself. It\u2019s on me for not telling her about my deep problems but part of the anxiety in me is fear of sharing it. \n\nSo fast forward now to maybe a few weeks after the baby shower, I reach out now that I\u2019m in a better place mentally. She ignores me. I feel guilty and hence I start opening up on why and giving her context and letting her know I\u2019ll be here. She deserves to know and I mustered up the courage to let her know my real problems. And that I understand she is angry but I\u2019d still love to make amends and make it up to her. I explained my side and finally told her why and how it wasn\u2019t intentional, that I don\u2019t want to be like this. \n\nShe then accuses me of being a bad friend, being one-sided, and how she doesn\u2019t care about me anymore. It really hurt me a lot. I\u2019ve gone through thick and thin with her and though my actions might have hurt her, it was never intentional. I just wished she tried to understand where I was coming from of all people. \n\nI just wish that she didn\u2019t assume the worst of me from one mistake when I\u2019ve spent a lot of time giving her the best of me.\n\nAITA in all of this? She still ignores me and I just want to communicate. I know she had been through a lot during my absence but I want to show effort since I have the capacity to now.",

Just\n\n1. Instead of saying yes or no, you said \"I don't know, maybe.\" How is anyone supposed to plan around that?\n2. You made it sound like her shower (and hence your friendship?) was not a priority for you. \"I've got important stuff to do, but maybe I'll condescend enough to attend your little shower.\")\n\nYou should have RSVPed \"no.\" Or if you thought you *could* make it and originally RSVPed \"yes,\" then you should have shot her a text or something saying that you weren't feeling well and would not be able to attend.",

May be time to move forward and find your person.  Give it time.  Maybe invite her out in a couple weeks.  Just a casual invitation and let it go however it may.  If she was really meant to be in your life, it will work out.  If not, better to stick with those who will support you and be understanding.",

You\u2019re allowed to make yourself the priority. You\u2019re allowed to do that in whatever way is the best and safest for yourself. However, freedom of self expression is not freedom of consequence. Your actions reverberate and unfortunately, when our friends are left without context to our withdrawals it can come across as flaky, uncaring, and inconsiderate. Just as you\u2019re allowed to take space to heal yourself, your friend is allowed the same space to react. She took your absence in an important time in her life personally, and it probably wasn\u2019t an isolated incident either. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation of why you pull away for extended periods of time, but it does help when we open up about our struggles. The more our friends know about us, the less they see as excuses and us being our honest and open, authentic selves. It creates more space for grace. I hope this is a good lesson and hopefully your friendship heals.",
