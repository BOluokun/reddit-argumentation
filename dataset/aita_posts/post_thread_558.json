She said I could stay at my parent\u2019s house (I\u2019m 36 years old). She told me she couldn\u2019t do it this year. I said, \u201cYes, I\u2019d be glad to\u201d because I was caught off guard. I thought about it and emailed her back the next day saying thank you for thinking of me but I work from home and need a secure phone connection (true) and am using one of the two bedrooms for an office. So am I the asshole?",
