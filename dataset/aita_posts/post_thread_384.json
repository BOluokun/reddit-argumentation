My wife and her friend planned a trip to the beach for four days which fell on Mothers Day. So I thought to myself that since I\u2019m watching the kids while she\u2019s gone that would count as a gift since she wouldn\u2019t be here to celebrate that day and would get home that night on Mother\u2019s Day. She gets home and realizes that I didn\u2019t do anything for her and later tells me that she is upset and message was received loud and clear. I tried to explain my reasoning and thought process but she didn\u2019t agree.\nSo AITA?\n\nEDIT: I worded this badly and not enough background. Instead of watching I should\u2019ve said taking care of the house and kids. Her going to the beach is what I thought she wanted to do for Mother\u2019s Day and me taking care of everything was enough because we pretty much split everything 50/50, she cooks more and I clean more. She wasn\u2019t expecting gifts but acknowledgement of her is what she was looking for but again her being gone that day I thought that it didn\u2019t mean that much and wasn\u2019t expecting anything. She didn\u2019t speak to me for 4 days after I apologized. Eventually we talked it out and admitted my mistakes for not communicating with her. I want to thank all the people that gave advice and actual conversations and didn\u2019t take personal shots and for the ones that did I was being sarcastic in my responses.\n\n\nUPDATE: She got me a Father\u2019s Day gift and it was not divorce papers.",

NEVER assume that because you looked after the kids for a few days solo that it absolves you from getting a mothers day gift or getting your kids to make her something.  that kind of decision needs to be made before hand.",
