  "post content": "My son \"Jordan\" is 27. His stepmom \"Natalie\" came into his life when he was 16. His mom had passed away when he was 13. Jordan never really considered Natalie as his his mom. He refused to let her get close and shut down every attempt to have a close relationship. He even moved in with his aunt months after Natalie and I got married.\n\nAs years went by, they started reconciling and seeing each other more often. He invited us to his wedding which took place days ago.\n\nWe got there and the atmesphere was great, Until later when I found out that Jordan had denied Natalie a mother-son dance and instead chose his aunt to dance with him. Natalie told me this minutes later and I couldn't help feel irritated and quite upset. I decided to get up and leave and we both left. I got calls from my family after they saw me leave. And Jordan called later and I told him why I did it. He got mad and said it was his wedding and that his aunt is basically a mother to him and said that Natalie shouldn't expect \"special treatment\". I said it's not special treatmrnt but a tradition. Besides that he hurt her feelings for no reason other than for the sake of being malicious. He got offended and accused me of ruining his day and causing a scene.\n\nNow the family sided with him and said I shouldn't have left nomatter what.",

I strongly suspect this isn't the first time you've chosen your wife over your son and is probably why he moved in with his aunt. \n\nIf you want any kind of relationship with your son going forward, I very much recommend both you and your wife apologise for throwing a tantrum at his wedding.",

But that took years to develop, which means it didn't really happen till my husband was an adult.  His step-father has always been supportive and just there, but he didn't try to be a new dad, just a caring adult in his life.\n\nMy husband's sister was 7 when their father died, and 11 when step-dad came into the picture.  Step-dad did more \"parenting\" with her, and they had some tense teenager moments when she yelled and rebelled against him enforcing house rules...  but they are also closer because he did do those \"dad\" things for her.  \n\nBut even with them having a closer relationship earlier, she still refers to him by his name, and at her wedding she had her Mom and step-dad walk her down the aisle together, because it didn't seem right leaving her mother out of that tradition.\n\nStep-dad was pleasantly pleased to have been included too, and would have been totally fine with her just having her mother do it alone...  but he can be a bit traditional in some ways and I think my SIL knew how much it would mean to him, and does genuinely care about making him happy, and making sure he knows how important he is to her.\n\nI think 11 or 12 is about the oldest a kid can be when a step parent enters the picture, to still have time to form a real \"parental\" bond.  Any later than that and there's just not enough time before they leave home...  that doesn't mean a really caring relationship can't still form in time, but it will never quite feel parental because you were never a helpless child dependent upon them.  So it just ends up feeling different.\n\nOP is the AH for not being able to see that as a fact, and not take it personally.\n\nThe fact that all that other stuff happened, the son moving out, etc, and OP STILL can't figure out that his son and wife are never going to have a mother/son relationship is insane...  how deep is the hole OP stuck his head into?",

Our son got married last year, and he and his then-bride were very interested in doing what caused the least amount of stress for them and others and in doing what was actually meaningful to them and their families (and my wife and I fully supported that). \n\nHis now-wife's upbringing is complicated: her parents were in an arranged marriage at age 13 (yes, in the US, very conservative Christians), later divorced, mom came out as gay, dad has a lot of personal problems now.\n\nHer dad initially said he would attend, and the plan was for him and her mother to walk their daughter down the aisle together. So, we were already planning to depart from \"father giving away his daughter\" tradition. Due to his personal issues, he flaked (which was not a surprise, unfortunately). Her mother was very nervous about walking her daughter down the aisle by herself. So, what did we do? My wife and I walked our son down the aisle, mom walked her daughter down the aisle. It was beautiful, meaningful and avoided stress.",
