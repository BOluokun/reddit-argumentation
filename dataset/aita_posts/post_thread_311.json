  "post content": "Background: for my 24th birthday, my dad got me a grey metal KitchenAid standmixer for my apartment. It was about $700 I think. However, I did NOT ask for this and honestly I freaking hate the color as it does not match anything in my place and it's also too big. I gave it to my friend who liked it and was moving to a different state. My boyfriend then got me a cute black standmixer that fit into my apartment a lot better so that's what I have.\n\nMy dad was over last night and he noticed that the grey standmixer was gone and replaced by the black one. He asked where it was and I told him the truth (namely, that I thought the grey was ugly so I gave it to my friend and my boyfriend got me the black one instead).\n\nMy dad was shocked and said the grey standmixer had cost a lot and that he thought I would have liked it so that's why he gave it to me as a present. Maybe here's where I'm the AH: I said if he would have been more observant, he would have known that I absolutely hate the color grey (it's my least favorite color) and everyone in my life who knows me knows that.\n\nI honestly wasn't trying to be rude, I was just stating a fact. But my mom called me today and told me I really hurt my dad and need to apologize for \"throwing away\" a thoughtful birthday gift my dad had put a lot of money and thought into.\n\nI don't think that's necessary, I think after my dad gave me the standmixer, it became mine and I could do anything with it. And I didn't \"throw it away\", I gave it to a friend.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nedit: okay so clearly I'm the asshole. I'll apologize to my dad. I didn't think it was such a big deal. But clearly I'm wrong. To explain some things: 1) I didn't say the \"observant\" comment to hurt him, he kept saying he picked out grey because it matches everything (which it does not) so that's why I elaborated on me hating grey 2) literally everyone I'm close with (except my dad I guess) knows I HATE grey. It's almost a running joke at this point 3) my friend is really into cooking/baking and I wanted to give her a moving-away gift, she's not just some \"rando\" person I gave it to",

Almost any color scheme you can pair with black works with grey. Also, you\u2019re 24. Grow up. Not everyone knows your least and most favorite colors unless they ask. In fact, most people only know other\u2019s favorite colors. They don\u2019t carry around a ranked list. Secondly, it was $700! If you didn\u2019t want it, you could have kindly said no thank you instead of giving away something that costed a lot of money. The correct and polite thing to have done would have asking your dad if he wanted it back. A little white lie doesn\u2019t kill anyone. Could\u2019ve just said it was a bit too big for your kitchen or that your boyfriend had already gotten one for you. You *hurt your father who wanted to give you a nice gift he thought you\u2019d like*. And instead you give it away, and get all snarky with your dad with the whole \u201cyou obviously don\u2019t know me that well\u201d bullshit line. Yeah it was yours, but that doesn\u2019t mean that what you did with it was right. Grow up, act your age, and give your dad the money back. Jfc.\n\n\nEdit: thank you for the awards but please save your money",

Would he mind if you exchanged it for something smaller? Maybe take him out with you to pick something out together to help him still feel apart of the process and show your appreciation that your dad loves you enough to go out looking for a nice gift for you.
