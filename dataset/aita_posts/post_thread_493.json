  "post content": "Me and this girl have been friends for the best part of out lives. We went through a lot together and we\u2019re like each other\u2019s safe space. I do love her a lot and honestly I\u2019m so so grateful to have her as my friend.\nBut lately things have been getting.. weird, in a sense?\n Usually, we go out together a few times a week, mostly during the weekends. We\u2019re together at school all the time, so I think it\u2019s normal we don\u2019t go out every day. \nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m starting to feel like an A-hole. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s been going on forever, but the past few months we aren\u2019t hanging out as much because of her brother. Idk what tf her parents tell her to do or how they\u2019re using this poor girl but she\u2019s basically taking care of him all the time. She calls me to hang out, but it has to be with her little brother because \u201cit was her turn to take care of him\u201d.\nHer brother\u2019s a great kid, despite being nonverbal and autistic. But going out with a little kid that is so unpredictable is very stressful. It\u2019s a whole responsibility. Her mom\u2019s a SAH mom, so what\u2019s the problem in her doing her job as a mum and taking care of her own kid?? \nSo that goes on for months and months. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like that kid, but it\u2019s so restring and even a bit embarrassing being a young girl and going out everywhere with a kid (he\u2019s 5). He throws random tantrums, he\u2019s very stubborn and strong on top of that. We can\u2019t pull our phones out around him because he\u2019ll cling onto them. \nThe weirdest part is that my friend never brings him with her when she\u2019s with her other friends. I don\u2019t know why honestly. Why is she doing that to me? I don\u2019t have siblings so idk how to take care of little children, especially in his case, communication is restricted so its even harder.\nToday I asked her if she wants to hang out tomorrow, just us two, shopping or doing whatever she wants. Of course, she denies. Idk why, she gave a bunch of weird excuses like that she had a lot to study, but few minutes later said that studying wasn\u2019t really an issue. Honestly, wtf is going on?? I just want us to be girls together again, not feeling like single mothers to this kid who actually has both a mum and a dad.\nYou\u2019ll probably call me an A-hole, but whatever. Honestly, I love my friend, but I don\u2019t want to have to deal with this huge responsibility and embarrass every time I want to go out with her.",

I can understand it being hard so your friend may see you as a great help when dealing with the kid.\n\nTruthfully, I don't think he should be with two teenagers unsupervised. Sure, his sister may know how to deal with him, but the same can't be said about you.",

It sounds like she\u2019s trying to end the friendship by using her brother as annoyance to  you. It\u2019s a weird passive aggressive behavior choice on her behalf. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting from your post.   \n\n\nMy advice, it\u2019s time to move on and find other friends. If she calls you to hang out without her brother, then consider it. \n\nNow his disability is really not important to your post, in my opinion. If you left that part out completely, I would have surmised the same thing. Teen girls do not want to hang out with little boys regardless of their abilities. \n\nDo not be so hard on yourself. This is an awful lot to handle and the addition of his disability causing you concern shows your level of empathy for others. You are allowed to have boundaries and feelings as well as empathy.",
