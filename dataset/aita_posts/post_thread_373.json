  "post content": "Family member told me to post here. \n\nMy (F52) husband (M56) and I have 2 daughters.  They are both great kids that are successful, accomplished and I couldn't be more proud, but lead very different lives.  We all still live in the same area, the area I raised them at.  One (F25) travels extensively for work and has an on again off again boyfriend and the other (F28) is married and has a 3 month old son.  \n\nMy daughter with the 3 month old works full time and is going back to work as her maternity leave is ending.  I work part time but offered to watch my grandson at my house while they are at work.  I'd quit my job, which I'm okay doing. We recently had a sit down about watching him and my daughter and husband gave me a list of rules, one they stressed was no animals around the baby.  That one was a bit of a surprise and conflicts with the needs of my other daughter. I asked why, they cited safety.  I accepted them, because I want to watch my grandson and be involved in his life. \n\nMy other daughter that travels for work has a pair of dogs. When she is out of town, she drops the dogs off with me.  The dogs can be a bit rambunctious but otherwise behaved.  She is usually gone 3 days at a time, usually midweek.  So the time that I watch the dogs would conflict with my grandson.  I've been watching her dogs for 3 years.  I've informed her that I want to watch my Grandson and because of that I can't watch the dogs as much anymore.  Well she did not take that news well and flipped out.  Says it isn't fair that she now has to find other means to take care of the dogs and it is financially affecting her. I told her I can stop by and check on them in the evenings, but I won't have the time to properly take care of her dogs if they were left at her place. She hasn't spoken to me or her sister in the past week.    So was i the asshole here?",

Would you daughter really have found other accommodations to watch the baby if you stood fast on the \"no-pets\" rule?  Doubtful.   Most animals get along well with children.  If nothing else, you can find a way to keep them apart if need be.\n\nYou chose the needs of one daughter over the other, and seem surprised that she's upset about it.   I have a feeling the daughter with child KNEW that you watched these dogs, which is precisely why she made up this rule.  You can and should, tell this child that you have reconsidered, and can't abide by the no-pets rule, so she'll have to find other accommodations when you are going to watch the dogs, or live with it.  Don't be bullied by your daughter, just because you want to see the grandchild.",

I also think the no animals anywhere near the child is extremely excessive and prevents you from ever getting your own pet, in the event you would want let's say a cat.\n\nThere needs to be some form of compromise with both daughters and that needs to start from you.

She offered to completely change her own life (quit her job) to achieve this goal. It sounds like the baby\u2019s parents were not expecting babysitting from grandma and put in clear boundaries to agree to OP\u2019s request which is at least partially to meet OP\u2019s wants (having the baby around a lot). \n\nThe daughter with the dog is the one who asked for free dog care and apparently assumed this would go on for the life of the dogs. \n\nWhat this gets down to is OP seems to no longer want to watch the dogs after providing three years of free care. She likely should not have agreed to be an unlimited dog care service. Once she decided it was too much or she just didn\u2019t like it, she should have let her daughter know immediately so she would have time to find alternatives. Dog daughter should have been prepared to find an alternative because it really isn\u2019t reasonable to expect an unlimited, free service from anyone who does not have an actual responsibility regardless of if that is babysitting a child or dog or any other sort of care. \n\nDaughter with the baby has a right AND responsibility to make sure her baby is safe. That includes not being around possibly unsafe dogs. I absolutely love dogs. I\u2019ve only ever lived away from them for a few months of my life and I hated it. My dad did keep an unsafe dog he loved when I was little and that created a life long fear of certain kinds of dogs in me. I\u2019ve somewhat worked through that but I still have panic reactions. Another relative kept an unsafe dog around her son until the 3rd time he ended up in the ER (surgeon had to be called) and they threatened CPS action if the dog was not rehomed. Having dogs around young children can work depending on the dog AND the ability of the caregivers to manage the interactions. Daughter with the baby would be negligent if she put her child in a situation with dogs she has reason to believe can\u2019t be trusted around a tiny infant. \n\nOP needs better communication skills. She overcommitted to dog daughter and didn\u2019t want to own up to that so she\u2019s allowed the daughter with the baby to be blamed for OP getting out of that commitment.

Neither daughter is thinking long term and both are going to be/have been relying on grandma who keeps offering them the world. And I think even when offered they are both over stepping a bit. I personally don't believe grandma should live her life for her grandkids (quitting job etc.), she already raised kids, it'S time for her to live a bit, that's a personal opinion though so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nYes I do think children come before pets in this situation but I also don't believe in overusing someone's good graces and their good faith.
