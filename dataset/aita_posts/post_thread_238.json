I only see him 4 days a month right now and he only sees his brother on the weekends because my ex took my older son away from me to go live with him when he wasn\u2019t doing good in school with me\u2026\n\nSo I told his dad no and said it isn\u2019t fair to me or his brother to allow him to go and I can\u2019t drive him there because it\u2019s an hour each way so would be 4 hours of driving for me.  His dad said he would give up the monday but I\u2019d still only get him from sunday morning to monday evening which is less than my usual\ntime.  Well my son is throwing a fit now and his dad is telling me I don\u2019t put my kids first, but it\u2019s literally just a dance?\n\nI barely see my son and I already up a lot of time for his football practice.",

YTA\n\nEdited to add: Woooowww, read her previous posts and comments and this woman is the worst. She is a bare minimum parent who doesn't want to pay or do anything extra for her kids. Contacts nope, extracurricular activities, absolutely not. She thought her son should play football... while wearing glasses wtf????\n\nShe has custody of the younger son now but he's 7... it ain't going to last because eventually he's going going to want to join clubs and have a social life and mom is going to shut that down bc he should spend time with her and it's not a big deal to miss childhood milestone moments/events you can't ever redo because she's too busy with her boyfriend and their kid to drive a whole hour to practices or games, and this kid is going to be begging to also live with dad.",
