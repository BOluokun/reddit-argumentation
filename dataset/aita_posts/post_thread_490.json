When I was told about this I broke down crying as we havnt moved in my hole life and I\u2019d be leaving my friends I have behind   \n\nIt\u2019s taken me years and years as I\u2019m a introvert and it\u2019s hard to socialise for me with out getting overwhelmed until a year or two ago I only had one friend that only talked to me due to our mothers being friends now I have made a group of friends that support me and I get a get a long with and I\u2019ve got the sweetest girlfriend that we will most likely haft to break up if we move my mother doesn\u2019t know about her and I can\u2019t tell her\n\nI love living with my grandparent we\u2019re we currently live a lot of singers I listen to tour here and I love music if we are to move it would be taking away some thing that brings me joy and all of my friends it would be taking away the environment I\u2019ve always lived in and it would be taking away things I love I\u2019ve told my mother that she can move with my siblings to  QLD but I will be staying here although I will visit them over the holidays. every time she brings it up I break down \n\nI can\u2019t think of moving with out going in to a break down and we end up in a massive fight over it as her friends are there and my life is here she wants us to move at the end of the year, I want to stay here until I graduate, am I the ass hole?",

It may help her see you as more mature and feel more comfortable leaving you with your grandparents! Good luck!!",
