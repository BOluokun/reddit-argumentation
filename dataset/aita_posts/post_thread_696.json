  "post content": "This is almost certainly not the first time such an AITA has been posted but I\u2019m in the shit.\n\nI\u2019m 24, female, work at a crappy store. I\u2019m kind of a chucklefuck (I think that\u2019s the technical term) and have a good rapport with all my coworkers. My manager (35F) and I in particular have a fun relationship where we rib at each other. Coworker who I\u2019ll call Teddy is in his early 40s and male. Not even a boomer. He\u2019s quiet, but we sometimes joke about things or discuss stuff, and I like him. He works hard.\n\nAbout three days ago there was a Bernie rally in our city. My manager went and talked about it in our work group chat. Teddy said something disparaging about the candidate. I\u2019m not even particularly political person, but it struck me as funny that he would soapbox in the work groupchat to begin with, so I hit him with the \u201cOK, boomer.\u201d It was on the mind because of that awful twitter video that just went viral, you know the one. The conversation died after that.\n\nThe past two days he\u2019s been even more quiet than usual, and VERY rude. My manager and I assumed he was having some troubles at home. But last night it dawned on me that he may have been upset by the text. My manager disagreed\u2014EVERYONES heard that meme, she said, and we\u2019re pretty sure he\u2019s Gen X, anyways.\n\nWelp. He quite literally just walked in and accused me of disparaging his age and appearance. I apologized, said I know I can be flippant and promised I\u2019ll tease him less, thanked him for being honest with me, etc. He\u2019s still being very rude to me, ignoring us and speaking angrily and under his breath.\n\nI feel bad! Age is obviously a sensitive subject for him. But my manager and my friends basically just laughed it off and said it was fine. Our job sucks. I want this to be a nice place to work. I don\u2019t want to be the insensitive bitch who makes fun of my older coworkers.\n\nTL;DR: \u201cOK, boomer\u201ded a Gen X coworker who took it very personally. AITA?\n\nPS: this meme is now dead to me. :(",
