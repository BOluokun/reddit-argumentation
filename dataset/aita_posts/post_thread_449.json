  "post content": "My SIL (married to my brother) is a resident physician who works 60-80hr weeks and frequently works 1 or both days of the weekend. Her residency is a 7hr drive from where me, my husband and my baby girl (1.5yr old).\n\nMy brother and I were always very close growing up and even lived in the same apartment and later same city. We were never more than 20-30m away from each other. I got married and had my baby and he moved 7hrs away to be with his fiance, now wife, pretty soon after I had my baby. It was devastating for me as I had always pictured us being close and him really involved as an uncle. SIL works 6am-5:30pm 6-7 days a week but does have some \"golden weekends\" where she has Saturday and Sunday off. She usually has one per month and then she has 3 weeks of vacation (never over Christmas or New Years holidays).\n\nDuring those 1 weekend a month that she has completely off, her and my brother either stay at home because she needs to relax or will drive 2hrs to see her family. During the 3 weeks of vacation, which she is only able to take 1 week at a time, they went on a 1 week long trip to Hawaii, a 1 week long trip to Cancun with her family and then 1 week where they just visited her family 2 hrs away. They haven't made the trip to visit us more than 1-2x a year as they say the drive is too hard with the limited time off she has and she's usually too tired to come anyways. But not too tired for Hawaii or Cancun?\n\nThey always ask my parents and us to visit them during holidays she works so at least we can be together and she will join everyday after 5. But, it's hard for us to travel with a 1.5 year old. My parents have to split time visiting there and visiting us and we need them for childcare. I've been asking my brother and SIL to visit us more even though I know her schedule is busy and my brother got frustrated with me. When I asked him to visit alone, he said she needs him because the heavy workload has been really mentally straining on her and quoted how resident physicians have a really high depression rate and basically called me TA.\n\nI feel its unfair we have to visit all the time considering we have a 1 year old  and also both work FULL TIME and feel they should balance better to visit us rather than just vacation. AITA for insisting?",

You don't have to travel to them if it's too hard for you, but you come across as really judgmental and lacking in compassion for how they choose to spend their limited free time. Asking them to travel 7 hours each way for a visit on the rare Sat+Sun she has off is unreasonable - that would be 14 hours of driving for probably not even 24 hours of time together including sleep hours. You say they do make the trip about twice a year, and that seems reasonable given these circumstances.",

Excruciating.  \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see how many redditors empathize with the resident\u2019s experience.

It forces them to literally eat, sleep, and breathe medicine, which is not great for one\u2019s mental health. Former iterations of resident socialization are also psychologically abusive, and I\u2019m sure there are some vestiges of that still out there. It used to be common practice for attendings to berate and humiliate residents for errors in front of other residents, to deter them from future mistakes.

I'm guessing you and her aren't very close, so to her visiting you would not be considered fun and relaxing, but rather a stressful chore she is forced to endure on one of the VERY RARE days she has off. Your entitled attitude about her and her husbands time is probably not helping things either, being 'devastated' that your brother is not super involved as an uncle is not the healthiest response, he's not a second parent to the kid and having the expectation that he wouldn't have his own wants and desires in life that would contradict your own could definitely be seen as selfish from an outside perspective (i.e. to his wife who is trying to build her own life with him, and doesn't want a demanding in-law butting in every chance they get.) I understand wanting your brother to be involved as an uncle, so if that's the case why not just ask him to visit more frequently alone if his wife can't make the trip? What about planning day trips where you guys meet somewhere in the middle? just because they don't have a kid doesn't mean making the trip is any more viable for them then it is for you, and expecting them to be able to make time for you're family in their busy lives while not trying to reach any sort of compromise with them isn't ever going to work out well.",
