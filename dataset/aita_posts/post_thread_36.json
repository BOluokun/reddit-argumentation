  "post content": "**throwaway account**\n\nOkay so I first met my friend *Jane (F29) studying abroad. We were really good friends during our travels and after college we actively stayed in touch visiting each other in our respective different cities.\n\nI met her bf *Bob (now husband) when they first started dating and have met her college friends and parents.\n\nBob and Jane decided to move to my city right before Covid so during lockdown we were in each others bubbles - we\u2019ve celebrated each others birthdays, we\u2019ve had Friendsgiving, Christmas parties together etc.\n\n2021 Bob and Jane got engaged in August and when they came back I threw them a engagement party. I bought her this wine glass that said \u201cwedding planning wine glass\u201d and every time she used it she would text me a photo of her with it.\n\nIn 2022 I threw Bob a 30th birthday party - but then this was also the first year I wasn\u2019t invited to her birthday.\n\nI had texted Bob asking what the plan was and he told me they were going out of the state for her birthday - however on instagram I seen them posting pictures of them renting a cabin with some friends\u2026so I felt awkward.\n\nThen I wasn\u2019t invited to the Bachlorette party - I didn\u2019t find this too big of a deal because Jane has some really close childhood friends and sorority friends but then nothing about the wedding.\n\nThe wedding happened this May and it was a big wedding - like 200 people probably and I wasn\u2019t invited. I was really hurt to say the least but I didn\u2019t say anything. I just tried to move on - I haven\u2019t talked to them really since before the wedding - they didn\u2019t wish me a happy birthday and they couldn\u2019t attend my birthday shindig cause they were out of town.\n\nI\u2019m noticing that if I don\u2019t reach out to either of them, they don\u2019t reach out to me at all.\n\nNow Bob has reached out and asked me to plan Jane\u2019s birthday party cause he says \u201cI\u2019m the best at planning these things\u201d and I told him I was hurt about not being invited and he said \u201cwell we had limit space don\u2019t make it a big deal we want you to be at her birthday\u201d \n\nI really don\u2019t want to do it and I don\u2019t really feel any desire to be friends with them - am I being a petty a*hole?\n\nEDIT: to clarify about the Bob\u2019s birthday party - Jane asked me to help plan it - that was the last time I\u2019ve seen them in person (march 2022).",

Asking you to plan their birthday, after all that, is absolutely wild.\n\nI've been not/uninvited to a wedding because of legitimate space concerns. What did that look like? It looked like my friend calling me, apologising, explaining his reasoning (namely prioritising family while also knowing that I'd enjoy the reception more than the ceremony), and both inviting me to the reception and also letting me know the post-ceremony park everyone would be gathering at, if I wanted to join for champagne. It was honest and lovely, and I imagine if the reception was also space-limited we would have had a similar conversation.\n\nYour \"friends\" are ex-friends, due to their own actions, and asking you to organise birthdays is so insensitive and egregious as to be ridiculous.",

This is the standard \"look out for this behavior\" reddit comment but abusers usually do very well to hide their true faces until they feel they've got their partner locked down (be it through marriage, a baby, a home bought together, sunk cost fallacy etc). When they think there's no way their partner would rather leave than make peace with them and put up with it. And the first step to that is typically isolation. OP was able to maintain this friendship for a long time despite living in different cities, the friend -after the engagement party- apparently texted OP every time she used the glass OP gave her but then the relationship fell off.. this doesn't read like a normal drifting relationship between people. Typically if you're going to grow apart it's because of distance or a change in priorities/lifestyle (like if OP had children and they didn't. It's not a bad thing to have kids but it's notoriously harder to maintain a social life once you have them so it makes sense that in the interim you may lose a few friends simply from lack of time spent maintaining the relationship). This reads as though everything was fine until they went radio silent on her. I'd be curious to know what was going on behind the scenes.\n\nIt's possible Jane really is just not that interested in a friendship anymore. But it would be a strange 180 from where OP thinks they were (another possibility being of course that OP may have read the relationship to be stronger than what it actually was. There have been plenty of times I thought I had super close friends only to realize they didn't consider me the same way). If OP described their friendship accurately to what it was, it's strange that it would fall off so quickly without outside influence (like Bob deterring Jane from keeping in constant contact). \n\nThis is all to say it's worth reaching out to Jane alone and asking what was up and why that happened? Maybe Jane will just spit out the same thing Bob said and get upset that OP would even ask in which case it would be better for OP to just accept the distance as she has and move along. But on the off chance it's what reddit fears and it's more Bob's influence on the situation I'd be on the look out for further isolation and just let Jane know I'm here for her whenever she wants to talk. Even if communication lapses my phone line would be open to her if she ever needs me. Sometimes people don't see the abuse written on the wall when they're inside the house. But if she is being isolated and it escalates it'll be so vital to know she has a friend in OP no matter the time spent apart. \n\nTo be clear it is not OPs job to save her if this is the case. If OP decides she does not want to spend the energy on this I can't blame her. She's only human after all. But if she still cares and worries for her friend it would be good to just reach out and establish that connection in case Jane ever truly needs it.",

It was a friend I ended up distancing myself from because they became a really odd, stage 5 clinger and I don't know if that is even the proper way to describe them. They never really had consistent friends growing up since they moved every 2 years. They had some serious abandonment issues. So every person they met became their friend versus new acquaintance. They would do anything for the person. I mean anything. Plan trips, birthdays, help people move etc. But the person wouldn't do the same back because they considered them more of an acquaintance versus close friend. Someone they went out with every weekend and they thought was a good friend, didn't invite them to their destination wedding. My friend didn't understand why they weren't invited. I tried explaining to them that that particular friend group was more of a partying friend group versus the kind of friends you have at your wedding. My friend just didn't understand. they were also a late addition to the group. Everyone else had known each other for many years and hung out more than just going out. So they all went to the wedding. Kept saying, \"but they would tell me really personal stuff when we would talk at the end of the night\". I had to remind them that at the end of the night that person was drunk and drunk people will spill their guts to anyone.
