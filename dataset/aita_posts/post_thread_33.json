  "post content": "Had  a belated Christmas gathering last week with my extended family. The  custom for this event is that we exchange \"stocking stuffers\" - nothing  over $10. Ever since I've since we've had this gathering, I've always  bought scratch off lottery tickets for all the adults.\n\nAs  you would expect, they are almost always trash. But every year we have a  few hit for extra ticket, 2,5, even $10. One year my uncle's ticket hit  for $50 and everyone went crazy. It's always a good time.\n\nSo  this year my 23 year old cousin goes nuts. He holds his ticket up and  claims that it just it hit for the max jackpot - $50,000. Everyone  rushes over, a couple of my uncles verify - yep this kid just won $50k.\n\nI  was fucking elated. I  scooped in him up in a big bear hug and said  Merry Christmas you lucky a-hole. He was screaming and his mom was  actually in tears and whole room was excited. It was literally one of  the top ten experiences of my life.\n\nI  feel my phone vibrate in my pocket and I pull it out to see my wife has sent me a text message that says \"Come out to the car.\" I go outside  and can tell by her body language she is pissed. She told me there is no  way that we are giving my cousin $50k, then starts fussing at me about  buying the lotto tickets to begin with.\n\n2  things to explain: I'm not saying that $50k isn't a lot of money - it's  a ton. But I'm in my mid forties. I have a 2 decade professional  career. My wife is a SAHM by choice. We drive late(r) model cars that  are paid for. Our retirements and the kids' college accounts are fully  funded. Our only debt is the house. I'm saying this to show while $50k  would be nice to have, it's not life changing money for us.\n\nMy  cousin, on the other hand. Just graduated from college. His mom is  single and was one of those fiercely independent women who refused charity. She took on extra jobs to help him pay for school. He worked at least two jobs himself while going to school full time and still managed dean's list. But he still had to take out loans. He landed a  job, but he can't afford a car yet or to live close to the office, so  he's looking at nearly a 2hr commute. He's also saving for an engagement ring for his sweet girlfriend of 3 years. This money would literally change this kid's life and frankly I think it couldn't have gone to a better member of my family.\n\nI explain to her that we're not giving him $50k, we gave him a ticket I  spent $5 on. She's not buying, and she won't let it go. She is now  demanding I go back in there and take the ticket back from him, saying maybe we'll give him some of it. We argue a little bit, I can't get her  to explain why she wants this money so bad other than \"it's ours and you're not giving it away.\"\n\n We fought all the way home and she  hasn't spoken more than a couple of words to me since.\n\nAITA?",

She wouldn't demand you'd go back in there and do some taksie-backsies for zero dollars.\n\nYour wife is completely in the wrong. You are right, you have not given away $50k, you gave him a gift that could have been worth $0 at the end of the day for a bit of a laugh and the lucky sod got lucky.\n\nI would just not talk to her either and tell her I'm very disappointed in this poor show of character and hope she sleeps it off.\n\nBesides, legally there were witnesses who saw you give the ticket to him as a gift and saw him scratch it and subsequently win. Morally and legally it's his money, not yours or hers.\n\nEdit: the irony of coming back to all these updoots! To think you can leave a comment on the internet and have it blow up in the Reddit lotto. No taksies backsies ppl!!! <lols in Reddit coin>",

You have people like u/tellbelle79 which at least it sounds like they all have an agreement at least, but I know a guy who plays lottery and often gives tickets as gifts and he literally tells people it is the best gift because if the person wins they will give you part of their winnings, because you bought the ticket.  Which made me not want to give  him shit even if I hit a huge payout.  It just irks me to buy a gift for someone in the hopes that you also get something out of it other than the joy of making someone else happy.  \n\nBut this story by OP is not uncommon either, the gift recipient is under no legal or moral obligation to share their winnings, to me its really no different than buying a PlayStation for someone, and then asking to borrow it all the time sine you paid for it.  A gift is a gift and  you give it because you want the person to have it.  I have heard of it causing problems with numerous people over lesser amounts than OP's nephew won.
