  "post content": "Hi, first time poster here. I (37F) lost my husband in 2014, it was very unexpected. We were together since high school and had a daughter (15F). \n\nIt took a long time to accept his death and move on but I did and I\u2019ve been in a new relationship for three years now. My boyfriend (38M) is amazing and I love him, he gets along with my daughter super well which is obviously important to me. The drama is, we\u2019ve recently been arguing about the fact I have a few photos of my late husband around the house. He said it makes him uncomfortable to constantly see the man I was married to. I have a table in the living room where I have a small memorial type thing, it has a bunch of photo frames of my late husband as well as candles. I came home from work two weeks ago and saw that my boyfriend took all of the photos off the table and stashed them in a drawer. It caused a massive argument. He told me he did it because it made him feel like a guest in his own home. I told him it\u2019s fucked up to be insecure over a man who isn\u2019t even alive but he believes his feelings are completely valid.\n\nMy late husband\u2019s birthday is the 14th of February and every year I go to visit his grave with my daughter. But this year my boyfriend got irritated over it. He told me he wanted to spend the entire day with me but instead I went to \u201clook at a gravestone.\u201d Apparently I ruined Valentine\u2019s day. I was FURIOUS. I asked him why suddenly has an issue with my late husband and he said it\u2019s because he was planning on proposing to me but he can\u2019t anymore because he believes I\u2019m still caught up on my husband. I ended up calling him a c*nt and and he angrily left the house and hasn\u2019t been back since. \n\nAm I the A-hole?",

They wound up living together, in the house she and her first husband had bought and raised their children in, until my father could no longer live at home due to advancing dementia.  \n\nMy father always honored and respected her late husband's memory.  His family pictures, and newer pictures of the two of them and our blended families, were added to the pictures in her home, they never replaced or displaced the pictures she had with her first husband, and their children growing up.  My father chose a sapphire ring to propose with, so as not to seem to compete with the (very nice) diamond her first husband had proposed with. \n\nIf your boyfriend cannot live comfortably with your memories and connection to your late husband, he's not the right one.",

                  "content": "It would be extremely damaging to OP's daughter if OP went along with BF's request to treat her first husband like an ex. My father effectively rewrote history for my stepmother, suddenly bringing up that if my mother hadn't died of cancer, they would have gotten divorced. It sounded like BS when he said it, because that did not reflect my memories of their marriage. He brought this up the first (and only) time they took me to a psychologist (severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD from my father and stepmother's emotional and verbal abuse). For some reason, he felt it was necessary for the psychologist to know this. She died a month after I turned 9, and he told the psychologist he thought I never really \"dealt with her death.\" This was all brand new information to me, although we had very little of my mom's things around the house. No photos, but they did display her doll collection (despite my stepmother \"parring it down\").\n\nI later brought this up with my uncle, who clarified that they were having problems related to the constant moving because my father was in the military. He also said that my mom and dad didn't fight because my father was not the type of person you could fight with (which I experienced myself and ended up leaving at 16 and have been estranged for the last 20 years). My older half-sister told me about my mom, who had always been an amazing stepmother to her, started treating her poorly the last year of her life due to the impact of the metastatic cancer on her brain. Putting these two things together, I believe that their marital issues were primarily due to the impact of her cancer.\n\nAnyway, the point of this impromptu therapy prompt is that it was so painful how my mother was erased. I do have a hagiographic view of her, which may be in part due to how awful my father became after marrying my stepmother. I don't want OP's poor daughter to go through anything like that and lose the connection with her deceased father. I cling to that connection now, with my only family being my mother's extended family.",

We don't even know what disease she had that ultimately ended her life, but they were treating it like leukemia. \n\nWell, her husband remarried without consulting his children and they were never, ever allowed to talk about their mother because it made his new wife \"uncomfortable\". \nAll of her photos were gone. \nShe collected Precious Moments figurines in this beautiful glass curio cabinet... The figurines are I don't even know where and the curio cabinet was shoved the the restaurant (which is attached to his gas station) bathroom. Cousin (maybe 23-24 at the time? Eldest daughter) asked her dad for the cabinet since none of us wanted it in the fucking bathroom. \nHe delivered it. \nSmashed to fucking pieces. \nDad and new wife are also collecting the social security that came from my aunt to go to the kids, and kept it, because according to new wife \"they have no right to their mothers social security\" (but, y'know, she does \ud83d\ude12). \nSo many other fucked up instances of their mom just being...

She passed on a Saturday, they were back in school on Monday. Since youngest brother was pretty young and never got any therapy and was never allowed to talk about his mom except to us, we're pretty sure that fucked him up *a lot*\n\n\n\nOP you're NTA, don't ever let anyone convince you to erase your late husband.

(You probably used film he worked on.)  So he needed to get to and from work, but didn't use his car during the day.\n\nOnce me, and later, my brother, were old enough to drive, he'd let us use the car during the day.  With a few rules, of course.  \n\nWe had to drop him off at work, before school (and before our before-school activities.)  We had to pick him up, on time.\n\nAnd he got to take us out to breakfast, on the way to work!  If we wanted to give rides to friends during the day, they had to be up, and join us for breakfast, too. \n\nHis treat.\n\nWe'd be at a little local diner, just after 6 am, for eggs and toast and coffee, before getting on with the day. We'd sit and talk, and just have a nice time.  \n\nThese breakfasts meant that he knew us, and our friends, well.  He was someone you could trust and confide in.  It was abundantly clear that he liked us, and our friends, and spending time with us was a joy for him. \n\nTo anyone with kids in this age range, I highly recommend how he shared his car, and the breakfasts as a way to spend time with and keep open communication with your kids and their friends.  And I hope you find as much joy in your children as I remember my father finding joy in us.",

The point behind it is simply to memorialize and never forget their loved ones; shrines are basically an outward expression of inward love and remembrance. \n\nIt's not a matter of moving on, either: surely the bf would have no problem if the daughter had died instead and OP kept a shrine for her even if they got another kid, so why be so upset about a shrine for a dead husband? Like it or not, OP loved someone who happened to die; she wouldn't even *be* with the bf if that hadn't happened. If he can't accept that some part of her is always going to love him, than he's not capable of dating a widower.",

But OP says he doesn't even like the few photos around the house, which I'm assuming is separate from the shrine given how she writes; according to her, it makes him \"uncomfortable to constantly see the man she was married to.\" \n\nMeaning, even if she *did* remove the shrine and kept the photos up, he'd still be upset. And that's where his feelings about the situation cross the line. He's dating a widower. She was married and had a kid with someone before him. If he cannot accept that and is uncomfortable with the reminder of that, than he is not equipped to date a widower. Pictures or not, there will *always* be some reminder that she was married to someone else. \n\nThis isn't a competition; she also doesn't need to prove she's \"over\" her dead husband by removing all traces of him, which sounds like what bf wants. \n\n>A lot of people say he's treating her husband like an ex but a deceased husband is worse. A dead man makes no mistakes, never says the wrong thing and can sit on a pedestal of perfection for all eternity. \n\n>It's a lot to stand next to.\n\nThis is all down to where you're at in your grief and your respective partner's insecurity. Not every widow/er is always going to view their dead spouse as this perfect partner who no one else can measure up to. Maybe in the beginning of the grieving process this is the case, but eventually, as they heal, they're going to let go of that perfect image. Holding onto an idealized image is not healthy, and you can't sustain a healthy relationship if you do so. \n\nLikewise, a widow/er's partner may initially be very insecure and compare themselves to the dead spouse, but ideally, their confidence in themself and their relationship will grow. Hopefully, the relationship will progress to the point that self-doubt only comes up every once in a while. A mindset of \"how can I ever compete with a dead spouse,\" while natural, is not healthy.\n\nBoth mindsets *need* to be overcome otherwise the relationship will never last. Both parties are responsible for reaching a place where they can approach the relationship from a healthy standpoint. And 3 years is plenty of time for their relationship to have come to the point of bf being secure in his position as OP's partner. To still not like the husband's photos on the wall and claim it makes him uncomfortable to be reminded she was married before 3 years in shows that he still has some major insecurities that have to be dealt with. And it's not on OP to remove all traces of her husband to appease him.",

But dismantling their photos is gross and calling their visit \"looking at a gravestone\" is out of line.\n\nOP's question asks if she's the AH for, specifically: visiting her dead husband's grave - with her daughter, as has been their tradition since he passed - on his birthday.\n\nIf you feel like she 'sucks' for doing that, what can I say? We disagree.",

Of course I will never forget him, he was the love of my life and father of my children. However: It\u2019s a fine line being sensitive to your current partner while still honouring your husband\u2019s memory. We all grieve differently, but to me, a few photos in your home are ok, but an actual shrine is way too much. Although I assume when you first met your partner the shrine already existed, so I wonder why it didn\u2019t bother him then? Visiting your husband\u2019s grave on Valentines Day does drive home the message that your late husband is the one you consider to be your Valentine and not your current partner. I\u2019m sorry but if you can\u2019t prioritise the living over the dead then perhaps you aren\u2019t ready to move on. NAH though.",
