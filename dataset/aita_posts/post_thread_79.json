  "post content": "I\u2019m 23M. I\u2019ve known I was adopted all along. For whatever reason I became obsessed with learning more about my birth parents at age 13. I was told all my life that my parents met both of my birth parents before I was officially adopted. My mom was white from South America and my dad was white from Italy. They specified these two locations to explain why I had tan skin.\n\nAs I was growing up certain things about my physical makeup made me more curious about my birth parents. My hair was kept short as a kid but as a teen I wanted to experiment. I grew it out and it grew out curly. Big curls but still curly. This upset my parents so they asked that I not grow it out. When I moved away for college I began to let it grow again. I met my girlfriend in school. She is Black American so she also helped me care for it. She once braided my hair before I FaceTimed my parents who lost it on me for wearing it that way. \n\nThroughout my time in school I still searched for my birth mom but would always come up empty. My girlfriend hinted that there must\u2019ve been a mistake with the information, even down to the name my parents claimed I had before they adopted me. She gifted me a DNA kit on my birthday that I didn\u2019t get around to until the lockdown hit. I didn\u2019t think anything would come of it because my parents weren\u2019t American so I didn\u2019t know if it would work that way. So I sent it out of boredom and got my results weeks later which have changed everything.\n\nI\u2019m Black and Middle Eastern. I have light skin and my curl pattern is so loose that I hadn\u2019t considered it a sign before. I have ancestral ties to Iran which can explain a more \u201cEuropean\u201d facial structure. I\u2019m sorry for my wording, I\u2019m still learning. I sent my gf a screenshot and she called me right away. We were both stunned though she long suspected. I tried to believe that my parents were innocently misinformed but my girlfriend kept pointing out the inconsistencies. My parents claimed to have met my birth parents therefore they couldn\u2019t have mistaken them for white. \n\nI confronted my parents who became enraged at me for doing a DNA kit. I was very angry, yelling, swearing. They robbed me of my identity and hindered my search with their lies. My mom told me through tears that my racial background comes with a stigma. That I passed so she wanted me to have an easier life fitting in. My dad yelled at me that I had to abandon what I just learned. I rage broke my phone and left. My siblings have been hitting me up on social media reprimanding me for being upset because our parents reasoning is sound. I do pass, I did have an easy life. I\u2019m not asking to be part of a struggle all of a sudden. I just don\u2019t think I should\u2019ve been lied to and I think they\u2019re reasoning is bullshit and racist. I\u2019m just supposed to act like 10 years of me searching with the wrong info isn\u2019t that big of a deal?\n\nEdit: \n\nThere\u2019s no way I can respond to all of you. Some answers:\n\nDNA kits can be wrong/Parents can be White South Africans:\n\nMy parents admit that my mom was black. My oldest sister also recalls seeing my mom at some point. Both verify that she was black. Yes they could be lying again. I have plans to continue to look into my background.\n\nYTA for having a temper/breaking your phone:\n\nOkay, that\u2019s fair. Someone was shocked that I could break my phone. I threw it. I didn\u2019t break it with my bare hands. I walked out and threw it out of anger and it shattered. \n\nHow do your parents treat your girlfriend:\n\nThey tried to treat her poorly. They were okay at first but eventually some comments were made that caused me to put some distance between us. My girlfriend was very hurt by their statements so I chose to keep us both away from them. \n\nClaims that I\u2019m race baiting: \n\nI don\u2019t understand how. I\u2019m angry about being lied to and how that lie has made my effort into finding my birth parents completely void while also rewriting my heritage. \n\nYou likely didn\u2019t pass to other POC: \n\nThat\u2019s my girlfriends stance as well. I\u2019m tan enough that going to an all white school still got me called slurs. Whatever issues my parents were trying to shield me from it didn\u2019t work. Maybe this is a lie that I bought into alone.\n\nThe current state of my relationship with my family:\n\nIt\u2019s chaos. Two of my siblings are trying to be supportive. I deactivated my Facebook and unfollowed some people on Instagram. I can\u2019t entertain the argument that I should forgive my parents and move on. I\u2019m not there yet. I get that it makes me ungrateful for feeling this way.\n\nFor those who asked about my hair lol. They are big curls? My girlfriend says they are 2c/3a. My hair texture is not unique to any race group but drastically different from my family\u2019s. \n\nFor those of you who are pming me slurs and telling me to go back to my shit hole country, thanks a lot. \n\nI appreciate your support. I appreciate those of you who shared your personal experiences with adoption and race with me, for giving me resources, books, and documentary suggestions, for welcoming me into your groups and giving me some kind words. I\u2019m overwhelmed by your support. I\u2019ve written down a lot of those recommendations. I\u2019m still reading everything you guys have written as well. I appreciate the kind comments about my parents as well. I don\u2019t hate them, I\u2019m just really upset and disappointed in their decisions.",

It's entirely possible they are angry because they are scared he will lose the advantages he had thinking he was white.\n\nTo further explain: I dont think it'd be fair to say they treat people differently based on race, but I think they **judge** them differently. \n\nRacism is racism, but what I'm saying is that they adopted OP and loved OP and are, in their own way, hurt by this as is OP. They don't hate OP for being black, they didn't want to *not* adopt him for being black. They don't hate black people, they view them differently though. Not enough to hinder their progress, but enough that they aren't making any personally, and feel they'd be judged for adopting OP.\n\nBoth are bad, but at least they don't overtly hate people of color and are willing to help people of color, in their own, fucked up white-ashing kind of way. Still, I'm just sad they took that route... Poor OP man... \n\nRegardless of all this, OP is NTA. The parents are TA, and OP now gets to really dive into a full, rich history and learn all new things, which is exciting.",

They actively chose this lie, which seems to go beyond passive racism (though that alone would be bad enough).\n\nWhen we chose to adopt transracially, we became a family of color, with all the joy and responsibility and hurdles that come with it.

L\n\nIt depends.  Among strangers, no, you won't face any stigma. If you are white-passing, people generally treat you like you're white.\n\nUntil you tell them otherwise.\n\nI have a cousin who is black (his mom is black) but he is white-passing.  He was in a fraternity when he was in college and everyone thought he was a helluva guy.  It came out somehow that he's black and suddenly everyone started treating him differently--giving him the cold shoulder and treating him \"unbrotherly\". Mind you, he never lied about his background.  He just didn't announce it with a bullhorn.  \n\nSo some people do act funny when they find out what your ancestry is.  That's how awful racism is.",
