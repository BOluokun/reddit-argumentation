  "post content": "My future SIL is marrying my brother next summer and they are planning to have a child free wedding. I have about 3 other sisters and we all have kids as do most of my cousins at this point. Our family is kinda spread out over the country and my brother/SIL\u2019s wedding is out of state for most of us. Once I found out they wanted to make it childfree I began to lose interest in going to the wedding. I don\u2019t want to be away from my kids for a couple of days and it is just a hassle to find them living arrangements for when my husband and I are gone - especially since most of our adult family members will be at the wedding. We\u2019d have to leave the kids with some friends. However, I get that it is her wedding and her decision so I just declined to go stating that I don\u2019t want to leave my kids alone without any family to watch them.\n\nAfter I dropped out, my other sisters got the courage to drop out as well as they also have toddlers they didn\u2019t wan\u2019t to leave behind for a couple of days. Then my cousins began declining to come as well. Now it has become a huge deal in the family and caused a lot of drama. My brother has called me and yelled at me saying that I was the one who caused all the problems. I was firm when I told him I wasn\u2019t going to his wedding unless I could bring my kids and that all our sisters/cousins pretty much felt the same way. My parents who are paying for half of their wedding are also pissed that so many family members on our side aren\u2019t coming, they were already somewhat against the idea of a childfree wedding in the first place and have now started pressuring SIL to not make it childfree. My SIL refuses to meet in the middle and says the wedding will remain childfree, but she\u2019s also mad at all of us for not coming. She also still expects my parents to help pay for it, which I doubt they\u2019ll do at this point lol. I\u2019m fine with her having a childfree wedding, I just don\u2019t want to be a part of it if it means being away from my kids for days. AITA\n\nEdit: People keep asking why I'm mostly talking about my SIL and not my brother in the post. I know for a fact my brother was okay with having kids at the wedding, its the norm in our family and he loves his nieces/nephews. It's my SIL who wants this to be a childfree thing against the wishes of like 95% of our family and still have my parents foot the bill. My brother is just supporting her to make her happy.\n\nEdit: She has an entire 4 day itinerary planned with like 6 events that she expects to all be childfree. Are all of us with toddlers and kids supposed to swing back and forth from hiding our kids in hotels with random sitters to all the wedding activities just to keep my psycho SIL happy? And then PAY for it because she sure AF won't since our kids are our problems as she's stated to my face. ",

You think she won't \"meet in the middle\" because she's not changing to what you want. \n\n\nIt's super common to have group babysitting at the hotel. All your siblings/cousins can pool resources and get a few people to stay a few hours at the hotel and watch the kids. Maybe even have your parents pay for it as part of the wedding fees. \n\nIf you don't want to go, don't go...but it doesn't seem like you are trying to actually work something out.",

The fact that so many people then dropped out for the same reason is not really on the OP.\n\nNow, the seeming belief that \"meet in the middle\" means that the bride should kowtow to the OP's needs is problematic (and that is an asshole move) but there is no indication that this belief has been shared with the bride (like how having racist thoughts isn't the problem so much as vocalising and acting on them).\n\nHowever, this also seems to be a case of not reading the room.

Yes it's her wedding but OP, her sisters and cousins all have rights to decline. At the end of the day leaving your child with a stranger, plus the extra costs involved, plus having your toddler in a new environment (hotel and what not) is pretty disruptive to there routines. \n\nI'm sure if it was a one night thing, a group babysitter would be fine but as it's not, why should she pack up her  kids to go. Why anyone should go if they have kids.",

It's not just a one afternoon/evening local wedding where parents would be close to home and would need a babysitter only for a few hours, it's a 4 days+travel events with 6 childfree activities. This obviously wouldn't fly with a lot of parents especially parents with young kids. The couple can decide the ground rules of the wedding and the invited people can decide if they want to attend or not a wedding with those rules. The bride shouldn't throw a hissy fit. It\u2019s the same if someone can't attend because the date is wrong for them or their health would make it difficult to attend. It's not the end of the world if someone can't attend (nowdays a big % of people have more than one wedding anyway.). \n\nIn my country babysitters aren't really a common thing. People generally don't feel comfortable leaving their kids with strangers, only with family or close friends and with friends generally they leave kids for like 2 days. Here people don't exclude kids from family events, because the kids are family too.\n\nFor ex. if it would be my wedding it wouldn't even come to my mide for a second to have a childfree wedding. Here when you invite someone to a family event, you invite the spouse and kids too. \n\nAnd though I don't want kids if I would be in OP's situation I wouldn't attend the wedding either. I wouldn't leave my kid home several hours away from me with a stranger/sitter (Family is at the wedding. And wich friend would take my kid in for 5 days just so I can attend a wedding?) especially not for days,  and I wouldn't bring the kid along either because it would be a lot of money thrown out of the window (travel expenses etc.) if they can't attend and still wouldn't want to leave my kid with a complete stranger/local sitter so I can attend the bride's activities. And if I skip everything to watch my kid why should I go? I can do that at home too. Even if I'm ok with leaving the kids with a sitter and have a trusted, long-term babysitter who is willing to come along to watch them during the wedding that would be a fortune. And going alone to a several days long family event while my partner is home with the kid don't feel right, and it's not even an option for single parents. Way too much hassle for a wedding even if it's my brother's.",
