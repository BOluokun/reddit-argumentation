  "post content": "This is a bit long and I apologize in advance.\n\nI (21f) live with my ex (21m) in an apartment with 2 other guys. We broke up because of trust issues but stayed friends. \n\nThings were fine the first few months after we broke up (we broke up in July and I'm stuck on this lease till may 2022) but then he quit his job and suddenly he never leaves the apartment and I never have space from him. \n\nHe has a problem with not knocking on my door and will just waltz in here and start talking to me. He also will still act like we're dating sometimes (say he wants to merry me, how he only wants me, calls me his girlfriend, trys to cuddle me, etc) and I always need to remind him we aren't dating anymore. This is particularly annoying recently as I'm trying to date again. He also has no respect for people's time and never has. He doesn't time manage, ever, and I'm surprised he was never fired with how many times he went to work late. \n\nOn to the issue.\n\nYesterday he said he was going to his parents house today for the night. I was thrilled, I haven't had space away from him and to myself in months while he gets the place to himself every day as I work 40 hours a week + I have my university courses on campus. \n\nI messaged him several times today from work about his plans to leave and he promised he'd be gone before I got home.\n\nGuess what? He was sitting on the couch when I walked through the door. \n\nI was of course very annoyed as I had a night of pampering myself planned as I had been wanting a night to myself for ages. He noticed I was upset and bugged and pushed my buttons on why I was upset until I snapped and said \"I just wanted to be alone tonight! Why can't you just do the things you say you're going to do instead of changing all your plans around and ruining any plans I made around YOUR plans!\" He got upset and said \"well I took to long to leave so there's no point now\" \n\nThis really pissed me off because it meant the only reason he didn't go today is because he once again, decided not to watch the time. This has been a constant issue of his and its impacted me negatively in the past (forgotten to pick me up from places, makes me late to events, etc). Then he had the nerve to ask if I wanted a hug (for the third time during that conversation) and i just snapped back \"NO! I want to be ALONE! I was supposed to be ALONE! So leave me ALONE!\" He finally left my room but the night is ruined now as he could just decide to bug me whenever he likes, and he will, because he sucks.\n\nI went and got water from the kitchen a few minutes ago and I could tell he was mad at me. I hate when people are mad at me but I think I'm in the right.\n\nAITA for reaching my limit, wanting time apart from my ex, and yelling at him a tiny bit about wanting to be alone? I mostly just want to know if I should be apologizing as I guess he technically did nothing wrong.\n\nEdit: I'm accepting that we both are assholes here. I'm going to figure out a way to find space for myself without forcing him out of the apartment. Thanks guys \u2764",
