  "post content": "Throwaway in holes my son doesn\u2019t read this. \n\n I (42F) have two children. Suna (20F) and Jae (25M). I am a widow, and am fortunate enough to have a well paying job as well as my late husbands life insurance. Once my children started working, I have always told them that I wouldn\u2019t ever ask them for rent, as I want them to save up for when they would either move out or if they would want to pursue higher education. We live in a three bed room apartment for roughly $2200 a month. \n\nFor further context, my daughter is a fairly independent person and cooks her own meals, takes care of her own laundry and even helps me around the house with the cleaning. She even gives me about $200 biweekly just to help out. \n\nI cannot say the same for Jae, as I usually have to clean his room and do his laundry because he lets it pile up in the laundry room. As for my meals and Jae\u2019s, I only end up cooking for myself as my son usually eats out or eats at his girlfriends house. \n\nMy son had recently asked if his girlfriend, Anais (23F) would be able to move in, as she\u2019s being evicted due to some issues with her landlord. Anais is a very sweet girl but we don\u2019t interact much as she doesn\u2019t come over too often. Her and Jae have been dating for about a year. \n\nI told him that his girlfriend moving in would undoubtedly change the rule I had set in place about charging rent. This is because as a couple, they\u2019d need to have some set responsibilities, just as they\u2019d have if they would rent a room someplace else or move into an apartment. I told him rent would be $750 a month, how they split it is up to them. I also let him know that they are more than welcome to use any of the groceries I buy, they can even request me to bring certain stuff home when I go to the market, but I will not be cooking for them. I also let him know I would not be cleaning their room nor will I be in charge of doing their laundry. \n\nMy son was enraged and started demanding why I am doing a sudden 180. I told him that he\u2019s a grown man and these are things a couple should find a solution to. I told him that he can either agree to these requests or him and Anais would have to find someplace else to live. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me in three days. I understand why he feels like I might be unfair, since I did say I wouldn\u2019t charge him rent, but adding an extra person to the household is an exception to that rule. My daughter understands why her brother is upset but ultimately agrees with me in that I should not be the one to take up what should be their responsibilities.\n\nAITA?",

We'd hang out, do regular quiet student stuff, and occasionally socialise with other people in our homes.

Being the racist little SOB the flatmate was, he didn't realise that all the different men he was seeing were simply my husband wearing a different shirt each time he visited.  The SOB was Chinese, my husband Taiwanese.

Let his room get messy and let his laundry pile up and suffer the consequences of a disgusting room and no clean clothes to wear.\n\nBy the time I reached double digits, 10 years old, I was expected to keep my room clean or face a long ass lecture about cleanliness. That was enough to keep my room clean. The only time my mom has done my laundry as an adult is when I've been too sick to get out of bed and it was a kindness to her sick daughter. \n\nYou're NTA over this situation with the conditions you've put on for his girlfriend moving in. Y T A over how you've been babying Jae who again is a grown ass man. He should be embarrassed that mommy still cleans his room. He's literally throwing a childish tantrum because he isn't getting rent free housing with a built in maid and chef.",

We've had a few rows but the ground rules are clean home and easy access of you can't do it then it still needs doing. I get them to help with what they can. It's difficult sometimes to break a habit and I hope they will help more as they get better.",
