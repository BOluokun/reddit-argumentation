  "post content": "For context, a relative of what used to be a close friend of mine whom we'll call Gary for this story contracted cancer. I (Mid-20s male) was sympathetic and even contributed $100 to a donation pool for their treatment. But Gary came to me one day and took his hat off to reveal a freshly shaven head. He told me that everyone in his family were doing it in support of his relative, and so were a lot of our mutual friends. Then he asked that I get on the bandwagon.\n\nI told him I didn't want to shave my head because I like my hair. My hair is black, regularly combed and well styled. He said I could just get a wig or something and had actually brought his shaver kit. He was unboxing it when I told him this was not happening. I don't even really know his relative that he's doing this for. So I'm not doing it, end of discussion. He called me an &$$hole and left angry. We didn't speak for a week. Then last Saturday I got invited to a party at another close friend's house. There I found out that Gary had tried the same thing on several other friends, and only a couple of them actually did shave their heads.\n\nGary wasn't at the party, so I had a blast hanging out, playing video games and listening to rock music. But I had way too much to drink and couldn't drive home. So they said I could just sleep upstairs. I passed out on a bed and it was a blissful sleep till I was shaken awake by another friend who told me Gary had showed up late and they caught him shaving my head while I was passed out. I saw what I looked like in a mirror and wanted to scream like I was in a horror movie. Gary even shaved off one of my eyebrows.\n\nGary was still there and acting proud of himself saying \"Now you're gonna have to shave off the rest, just like me! LOL!\" I was furious and called the cops. When they got their Gary fully admitted to what he had done to me and even said he was justified. The police didn't seem to think so as this is classified as a form of assault. They asked me if I wanted to press charges and the first words out of my mouth were \"HELL YES!\" Gary cussed me out while they took him away in cuffs. I tried getting my hair restyled into something presentable. But there was no saving it and now I'm bald too.\n\nNow a bunch of Gary's family are telling me to drop the charges because Gary was off his meds and didn't mean to do it. I was like \"WTF?!\" because I never knew he was on meds. But I still refused to drop the charges. It'll take months to grow my hair back the way it was. But all of the calls and messages from Gary's relatives are starting to get to me. Just about everyone else in our friend group has cut Gary out though and say that I'm doing the right thing by not dropping the charges. So now I'm divided.\n\nAITA for pressing charges on a former friend for shaving my head in my sleep?\n\nEDIT: I want to make something clear here. So many people have said things like \"Dude it's just hair!\". But would they all be saying that if I wasn't a man? What if I was some girl that had hair that took years to grow? Would they be saying the same thing? Sure hair grows back. But it takes time. If it was something that grew back fast, people would be less inclined to care. But it's not fast. It takes months. And for some who had long hair, years. That's a lot of time wasted growing.\n\nAnd I don't plan on pushing for Gary to go to prison. But I don't plan to drop the charges either. His family already bailed him out. And while I didn't know he was on meds, I knew he had quite the temper, and even an entitled attitude at times. One example being a lunch where he wanted us all to combine the check and split it evenly. He got the most expensive thing on the menu. I got a cheeseburger. When we all said \"No\" Gary went off on us for not being good friends. He's always been an ass when he doesn't get his way. And I've only known him for like three years. This incident was the last straw for not just me, but a lot of other mutual friends.\n\nAs for the charges. I don't want to send Gary to prison. But I would like him to get some therapy and community service. With the way Gary has acted around me in the past, and what he did to me, I actually wonder how long before he got more violent. I've seen and heard of him getting in fights for less. \n\nEDIT 2: I've gotten many comments from people saying \"YTA! He has cancer!\". If you actually read what I posted, Gary is not the one with cancer. A relative of his I don't know does. And no, I don't know what kind of cancer. Gary didn't elaborate. He wanted me to shave my head for this person. And when I refused, he left in a tantrum. Then shaved my head while I was passed out drunk at a party. ",

Last summer I got really manic, I blew an very large sum of money and was throwing away a year of progress on something else. I had a sheriff show up at my house and arrest me on warrants from a year and a half old charge, my family bailed me out of jail. I was broken, I won't lie I thought about killing myself. I'm still scared that it will ruin my life but now I have been reminded what is at stake. Everything, that's what I could lose. My job, my girlfriend. On Monday I will likely sign a plea agreement and then I will finally be able to stop being scared after nearly two years. Honestly I'm tearing up typing this. Between therapy and a strong support group that won't enable me when I'm in such states I am in a much better place than I was before. \n\nBack to the point, blowing all my money didn't teach me anything. $25k down the drain and that didn't do it. It took a cop showing up on my door and putting me in cuffs. I could see in his eyes he felt bad as I cried in the back seat of that car. My nephew that I live with, my nieces that were over visiting, they saw me taken away in cuffs. When I came home my nephew gave me such a big hug with tears in his eyes. That's what taught me what I needed. Being told that he cried when I left, telling my girlfriend and having her stand by my side and tell me that we would get through this. It broke me. The thing that saved me was what the jailer said to me as he took my finger prints, \"Don't look at this as you going backwards, look at this as a sign to keep moving forwards.\" That guy that I had never met before did a lot to help me, he was kind when he didn't need to be. He made jokes with me and even complimented my dragon ball hat and told me how great it is that you can just wear stuff like that these days without being judged for it.\n\nGoing to jail taught me a lesson. Every day is a challenge and I must meet that challenge. I have to keep putting one foot forward and I have to ask for help when I need it.",

My mum drove him to his doctors appointments. We went to visit him after his surgery and mum fought Centrelink when they didn\u2019t want to give him the disability pension. \n\nWhen my dad had cancer, I made him high fat smoothies to stop him losing weight and I cleaned his vomit out of the sink. \n\nShaving your head doesn\u2019t help someone with cancer. With kids, it might make them feel safe because they can relate to someone, but realistically, people with cancer don\u2019t need you to shave your head, they need you to help with the every day practicalities. Because you might shave your head, but after that one act of solidarity you\u2019re gone. They need rides to chemo, they need help cleaning the house and doing the laundry, they need someone to walk the dog and carry groceries and cook. Things that are actually fucking useful. Grand gestures don\u2019t help. It\u2019s small things that do.\n\nEdit: thank you for the awards, if you want to set up a meal train for someone you know who\u2019s undergoing treatment for cancer/recovering from surgery/has just given birth etc, there\u2019s a website dedicated to it.
