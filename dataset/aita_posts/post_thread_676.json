  "post content": "So my girlfriend (whom I live with) has always wanted a dog. And me, I like dogs *but* I do not want the responsibility of owning one. Well one day she told me her sisters dog had puppies (boxers - one of my least favorite breed) and I expressed to her that I don't want a dog, I want nothing to do with a dog, etc etc. Well she kinda got the whole attitude of well im doing it anyways. I told her if she gets a dog I am having 0% to do anything with it. I'm not helping with bills, training, feeding, taking it outside, ANYTHING. I don't want the responsibility. \n\nWell fast forward a few months later and here we are with a 60lb 8 month old boxer.... And I hate it. We live in a smaller 750 sqft apartment so this dog is always in my presence and that alone annoys me. When left alone, It chews anything near by, destroys blinds, tears up carpet and generally trashes the place. It's so irritating to be mid conversation or mid TV show and have to stop what your doing because the dog is up to some shit again. It's a small apartment and a rather big dog. We cant put it in the bedroom alone because shit will get ruined. I know some of this may seem trivial, but when i mean I didn't want a dog, I mean I didn't want to deal with literally anything the whole \"dog package\" has to offer. \n\nI make sure my girlfriend knows I don't like it. I call the dog a bitch (mostly to be ironic; it's a female dog) when it acts up, push it away from me whenever it's close, ignore it as much as possible, I don't feed it, I don't let it out of it's cage, and if it whines and barks I tell it to shut the fuck up. I literally do nothing for this thing. \n\nOkay so that seems pretty bad now that I typed it out and am reading it and I'm probably gonna be deemed an asshole. But I've never actually hurt the dog, and never intend to. In my defense it doesn't understand English, so it's fine. \n\nIt just sucks because I'm paying to live with this animal that I really don't want to deal with. My girlfriend and I split rent so there should be compromise, but with this dog, there was none. She brought this thing into my house and I'm already tired of it. \n\nOn the bright side (for me) my gf knows not to ever ask anything of me for this dog and has been keeping up to that standard so far",

And if you not wanting it is a deal breaker she should have broken up with you prior to getting it as you made your decision. Communication is important in a relationship. You communicated.
