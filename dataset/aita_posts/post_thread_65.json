  "post content": "My father was never present in my life even after various attempts I made to have a real relationship with him. The little time I spent with him as child he was very abusive (it took me longer than most to lose my baby fat and he'd always make snark comments about it; he'd also compare me to evey other child he knew and I'd always not be as good as them). \n\nWhen I was ten my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. Things got really tough, we had to move in with my grandma who became responsible for the both of us. Money was always tight (mental ilness treatment is very expeny in my country). My grandma tried to contact my father to ask for  help with me because it was really tough for me to see my mother in the state she was in. He always said he couldn't take me in or help with extra money because he had a new family that need his attention. After a while he moved to the other side of the country and didn't talk to me for years. \n\nEventually things got better, the meds started to work and now you couldn't even tell my mother has any kind of mental ilness. However, money was still short for us, especially after my mom got pregnant again even after the doctors said that was impossible (abortion is not a option in my country). \n\nAfter I finished HS I had no hopes of ever going to college because we couldn't afford, but my mom still made me take my country's equivalent of the SAT. Somehow I got a 50% scholarship for one of the best schools in the country. The problema was, even with the scholarship, we still couldn't afford and I couldn't work to pay for it because the school was in the next town and I'd spend literally every time off in traffic (we also don't have college dorms here).\n\nAt this point my dad was back in town, so I decided to give it a try and contacted him to see if he could help. He wasn't rich, but he had money and was alwaysdoings stuff with his family so I figured he would have at least a little to help me. \n\nBut all he said was: \"can't help you,,you know that. Just find a job\". And after that he never tried to contact me again.\n\nRight after that my mom received a very high restitution form the state and literally gave it all to me. I went to college, graduated, got a amazing job and now I paying for my sister's college.\n\nLast month my mom made a FB post saying how much she was grateful to have me as her daughter because I was helping with my sister education and then out of the blue my dad decided to contact me and ask for me to help with his other daughter college too. I said I couldn't because I was already paying for my sister's and I was saving to buy a apartment. I also said that maybe she should get a job. I felt really great, but then them he started to say I was being a vindictive a-hole. He made a FB post about it and now a lot of people are agreeing with him to the point where I'm reconsidering it.\n\nEDIT: \n\nWow, this really blew up. I decided to make this edit because it would take me forever to respond every individual message. \n\nFirst, I want to thank you for how nice all were. Also, really thank you for whoever sent the wards, you didn't need, this is just a troaway account. \n\nSecond, I decided I wont be making a FB post to respond to him. A lot of you said I should post my side of the sorry, but tbh I don't think people will care. The ones that are on his side knows he was never present and knows my mom was sick, they just think I should help because we're \"family\" and nothing will really change their mind. \n\nThirdly, I decided to help his kids. I know I have no obligation to them, I know that maybe he's lying about his money problems, but it's just hard for me to see a person I'm technically related to in a situation I struggled so much with. But I won't be given them money per say. A very good friend of mine works teaching for a college in my city, it's far from the best school, but they offer a lot of scholarships and they are cheaper than most. He said he could get up to 25%. As I said, it's really not the best school, but it's still better than nothing if you're in need. They could try getting a loan for the other 75% or something.",

How many of those people are having money problems? You owe him nothing, you owe his children nothing. If your sister passed you by would you even know who she was? \nAnyhow if you truly want to financial help someone out you could probably search GoFundMe and find a story that connects to your heart or a charity. Or search your friends' pages on Facebook to see any charity pages they have set up... obviously not saying you need to give anyone your money to anyone, haha...just trying to say that there are millions of people with financial struggles that need help. You don't actually truly know your father's financial situation because he's not even close to you and if he was would he let you check out his bank account(s)?

If you knew them well, grew up with them etc that might have changed some things. But honestly, nobody is entitled to your time or money or even emotions. Certainly not an absentee father who is now hoping you'll take over and save him some cash. These people are strangers to you. None of them reached out or expressed interest in you or advocated for you. So screw 'em. This is money you've earned through your hardwork and efforts and you can decide where you want to spend it. \n\nPlease don't let people who only know his half of the story dictate what you should or shouldn't do. Ignore the Facebook crowd. Focus on your financial stability and pay for your sister's education and your house. Your bio-dad's kids will manage, like you did when he refused to help. There's always a way for someone determined enough. Ignore your bio-dad and block him and his army of flying monkeys.",
