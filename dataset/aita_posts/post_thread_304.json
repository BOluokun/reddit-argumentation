  "post content": "\nMy son is 18, He is going to be attending community college and is living with me, my husband and his 2 younger half sisters.\n\n\nThe other day I found out that he found and accepted a job without telling me. I was upset with him about it and the reason for that is that first of all, he should've told me since we live in the same house and also, and more importantly now I'm left without someone to stay with the girls from 3 to 8 where my shift start-ends. my son is usually the one to stay home with the girls and his new job is during these hours so one way or another we are impacted.\n\n\nHe told me his friend found him this job and it just happened - but I don't think it did because he knew he had to give up staying with his sisters while I work. my husband travels most of the time (he's a pilot) and paid child care is a no for me. My son said I shouldn't be surprised by him trying to work to save money to be able to pay for himself but that is just absurd since he literally lives with us without having to pay for anything except for his own entertainment. He said he needed the job and he wasn't reallistically going to stay and watch his sisters for days on end especially he doesn't get paid for it. We kept arguing and my husband got involved and he too was upset saying that my son had no respect for us. my son basically had a \"like it or not\" attitude with us and kept refusing to discuss this wirh us saying we have no right to be upset with him and should just accept it. but I'm just...I think that he's being inconsiderate of my husband's and I's struggle to provide for the family as a whole. this should mean something to him but he acted selfishly.\n\n\nETA okay, it seems that I did not mention the reason why the babysitter option isn't ideal and is because my daughters don't want a babysitter. they're both dealing with some issues and are unconfortable being with a stranger at home. besides that my son decided to stay with them and we didn't ask him or anything.\n\nETA Okay, some of you here are implying or suggesting that I'm making my son to be the girls' babysitter but that is in fact not true. He doesn't do much for them, just stays home with them while he studies or plays video games. He adores his sisters and only stays with them when he wants to. otherwise we wouldn't force him. Also, my husband said the girls are too young for therapy and I agree with him on that.",

I am in a similar boat to OP and likely your mother. i can't work without the babysitting, but she was in highschool and a little bit after, so it's on her way.. she doesn't really have to do much besides pick them up, they're old enough to entertain themselves. but because I'm single, I don't have another back up and I simply don't earn enough to justify care..\n\nhere's the difference - the second she got a job, daycare became 100% MY problem again. They're MY kids! she did me a solid helping me out when she had the time but her priorities start and end with what she needs to do with her life. luckily my kids were 10 and 11.. plenty old enough to get themselves home and self directed enough to do their chores and homework before I get home.\n\nI owe my daughter for giving me that time but I'm not entitled to it. my daughter didn't have to sneak around to gain her freedom - I actually got her the first job. my kids don't dictate whether they're having a new babysitter and when my kids needed therapy because of my abusive ex, they got play therapy. \n\nand I've been very mindful of potentially parentifying my eldest by putting her in a situation where I rely on her that hard. if it became a case of the children being unable to go into care and my daughter needing to work or study, then I am afraid I need to find a different job - not my favorite choice, I don't have the luxury of a second income, but once again, it comes back to being my problem to deal with!\n\nall of these non issues she keeps throwing out to excuse this situation speak to a lack of maturity. you can be a little miffed that you didn't get much notice, but I would be asking myself *what is it about our relationship, that makes my daughter feel like she can't come to me with something like this*\n\nYTA because as much as I empathize with the situation, being a working parent myself, that's what you sign up for.",

She set it up where I had all my classes 9am-9pm on Wednesdays. Which really would have been 7am-9pm since I would have needed tutoring (my mom also picked my \"major\" which was a 2 year certification in the medical field). I didn't want it at all and she wouldn't make a compromise because taking me to school once a week would already be an \"inconvenience\". The conversation ended up with me crying, my mom crying making me out to be horrible and my mom having all my classes dropped. The whole thing happened in front of whoever helps new students with their schedules. I got yelled at for \"wasting\" her time, we had driven there 2-3 times total that week of registration. I'm 24 now, ended up never going to college and didn't learn to drive until I was 21 (my then boyfriend, now husband, taught me). \n\nOp sounds a lot like my mom (and MIL but thats a whole different can of worms).

Be adults and find childcare for your daughters. YES you need to PAY for child care. You cannot force your son to give up his life to take of of your children. That's the using part. You two are FINANCIALLY ABUSIVE to YOUR SON by NOT paying him wages for the child care. And now that he is a legal adult he is doing the best thing he can for HIMSELF by getting a job, and an education to get the freak away from you two.  You cannot force him to take care of your children. That's what your responsibility is as a parent. You owe him an apology and past wages for that matter. Let go of your son.\n\n\n\nOP stop trying to justify this nonsense\n\n\n>ETA okay, it seems that I did not mention the reason why the babysitter option isn't ideal and is because my daughters don't want a babysitter. they're both dealing with some issues and are unconfortable being with a stranger at home. besides that my son decided to stay with them and we didn't ask him or anything.\n\nYour daughters are your responsibility. If they are uncomfortable then you need to find a solution to help ease them into including therapy for them too ( are you even DOING THIS). Your SON isn't a permanent crutch for your misgivings!!\n\nAlso funny how you claim you didn't ask him to babysit... So that's cool. He didn't ask you about living his life and doing something else besides being your free child care. You have nothing to be mad about if that mess you just spewed is how you feel. NOTHING.\n\n\nOhhhh edit number 2\n\n\n\nNow it's \"not\" a big fucking deal to them... His help isn't that important and he really doesn't do anything...... Funny cause your original post said otherwise\n\n>ETA Okay, some of you here are implying or suggesting that I'm making my son to be the girls' babysitter but that is in fact not true. He doesn't do much for them, just stays home with them while he studies or plays video games. He adores his sisters and only stays with them when he wants to. otherwise we wouldn't force him. Also, my husband said the girls are too young for therapy and I agree with him on that.\n\n\n\nOh look.. her girls have mental health issues..THAT THEY ARE REFUSING TO DEAL WITH. That's cool.. Let your daughters suffer as well because you want to act like a coward and bury your head in the sand pretending nothing's wrong with them.... My God I hope this is a troll.... Those poor kids.\n\nAnd now she's backtracking and saying he doesn't do much. Besides watch them FOR 5 TO 6 HOURS EACH DAY.\n\nBUT THEY DON'T FORCE HIM. So if that's true than wtf even make this post?? Why be so upset him being an adult and working and going to college??\n\n\nEdit....thank you for the awards.... This post blew up quickly.....",

              "content": "There really isn't a \"too young for therapy\". It is just about finding the therapist with the right skillset. People under age 4 are usually best served either through Family Therapy or by an Infant Mental Health Specialist. People ages 3-10 need Play Therapy [(funny video explaining why)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt3QRLTXZW4) and you can find a Registered Play Therapist through [www.a4pt.org](https://www.a4pt.org). People 8-13 need Activity Therapy with a heavy emphasis on play. Around 13 the emphases can move more towards activities and less on play, but people age 12-18 still need Activity Therapy. Talk Therapy can start as early as 16, but it isn't the ideal for anyone under 20 (though many 18/19 year olds can handle it very well).\n\nTalking is allowed in all of those types of therapy, it just isn't required. Play is a person's first language, and there are decades of research that show the effectiveness of play therapy for resolving all kinds of mental health issues. The older we get and the more our brain develops, the easier it becomes to process issues using words. That's why the type of therapy shifts depending on the age.",
