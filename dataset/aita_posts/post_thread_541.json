  "post content": "MY (32F) grandmother recently decided to gift me and my husband a screen door for the house. We have a one year old, so she said this will add a sense of security. I am very appreciative. I see this as a really sweet gesture. \n\nSo my grandmother paid for the screen door and she hired her neighbor/friend to install it. I think he works for construction or something. All was fine until it was time to install the door. He took over 4 hours and eventually my family and I had to go to sleep because it was getting too late and we had work in the morning. \n\nI appreciated the fact that he didn't want to give up on the project, but it was an obvious struggle for him. (I think I read online when ordering that the door should take about 30 mins to install.) I kept offering him help and asking if he needed anything but he refused. \n\nIn the morning, we saw that the door was only partially installed. There was no handle from the inside, and it was locked, so we literally couldn't exit the front door. My husband had to go outside through the back and install the front handle so that we could simply open the front door. There were also visible holes where there shouldn't have been and it was not completely aligned. \n\nSo here is the issue. My grandma asked how it looked and I told her the truth. It isn't finished. She is insisting that he come and finish the job since she already paid him. I am pretty adamant about just hiring someone else (and I'll pay for that with my own money of course). I don't see the point in her neighbor coming back if he is incapable of doing the job. It will just prolong the process and likely be frustrating for everyone involved. \n\nAITA for telling my grandma that I'll just hire someone myself to finish the job? Thanks for any advice. My grandma is the sweetest in the world and I don't want to hurt her feelings. But I also think she was trying to be sweet to this guy by hiring him and encouraging him to take on a job that he may not be comfortable with. She's the type of person it can be hard to say no to.",
