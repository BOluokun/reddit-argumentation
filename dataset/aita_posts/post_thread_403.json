  "post content": "My (25M) GF (24) had a double mastectomy 5 years ago; she had breast cancer, and thankfully made a full recovery. Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery. This was before I met her. \n\nI'm a big anime nerd, and last weekend I invited her to a small anime con with me. She's seen a few episodes of my favorite shows, but she's not into anime; she does like cosplay, though, and she works seasonally as an SFX artist at a haunted house near us. So when I asked her to go to the con with me, she asked if she could cosplay, and I said sure. She got very excited and said I was going to love her costume, so I'll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me.\n\nWell, not exactly. The day of the convention comes, and she showed up at my house cosplaying Dabi from MHA- specifically a look he has later in the manga. It's a long white coat over white pants, no shirt. Her entire chest was exposed and she'd obviously spent hours applying burn makeup; she has short hair that she dyes constantly, this time she bleached it white and dyed a few red streaks. \n\nI wasn't expecting her to show up without a shirt. Her burn scar makeup only covered half her chest, so you could clearly see her mastectomy scar. It wasn't a verry attractive costume, especially since she'd gone all out with the scars and made them look raised and kind of realistic. \n\nWe went to the con, and while a lot of people came up to take photos with her, I noticed several others looking at her chest. That evening, she said I'd been quiet all day, and I honestly told her I was a little embarrassed that she was flaunting her mastectomy scar like that. She got mad and said she was making the best of her situation and said I was being insensitive, and she's been distant ever since. I'm starting to feel guilty. AITA?",

It's very thoughtful of her, and she's clearly very talented and was excited for you to see her costume, because she expected you'd think that her craftsmanship was amazing -- based on the con's reactions, I'd say it probably was.\n\nYou don't seem to appreciate her for the person she is, and expect a lot out of her in very superficial ways.

When she woke up one morning and couldn\u2019t use one side of her body they suspected cancer had spread to her brain, but they could only run limited diagnostics due to the spacers. \n\nShe had to get back to back emergency spacer removal and brain surgery because they couldn\u2019t do scans with them in. Fuck that noise. She was 50/50 reconstruction vs just rocking a flat chest from the beginning and honestly in the end she wished she just went with her gut that said to heck with beauty standards. A lot of people pressured her to go for the reconstruction because she was only 30 when she got her double mastectomy. Also, you potentially need to get new implants every 10 years unless you get a DIEP flap. So, you\u2019re not only signing up for one reconstruction if you\u2019re young, but potentially decades worth of implant swaps. \n\nGF sounds like an amazing and confident woman  who made the best of a really challenging situation (cancer/ mastectomy scars) and I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t value her.",

I worked things like London Fashion Show where you are doing five full smoky eye looks in what feels like less time than can exist to a precision some surgeons lack and then belting it to another venue with a 40 kilo kit. And I loved it.\n\nAll that. All the wedding make ups, counter sales and psychology side. The photo shoots and budget and 3am starts are nothing compared to the skill I appreciate in SFX. That is science, art, witchcraft and to do a chest piece on yourself using prosthetics mirror image is incredibly mind blowingly difficult. Blending prosthetics on scar tissue is another level. \n\nThat shit is hard as hell. You need way more understanding of the anatomy, dermatology, the chemistry of the products and steely nerves because that stuff is SO EXPENSIVE. Custom prosthetics or latex pieces you create are a one shot thing and can run to 100s per piece. \n\nI sat in on a few classes with a friend and could not fathom the expertise. (Admittedly I am possibly the most squeamish person alive and some of the stuff was so realistic I felt faint.) She loved it and it was her thing. She was absolutely baffled how I could find doing someone\u2019s eyeliner while talking them through a break up and upselling craftily or intuiting what a director meant by Wes Anderson but if Margot Tenenbaum was in a British Nineties teen magazine 5 minutes before a show where the brief had been \u2018kohl goes cool but strong lines no smudge\u2019.\n\nI was like \u2018yeah but I can bullshit it. You are doing reality. I can interpret that brief and recheck. You are doing specific scar tissue on scar tissue to match continuity? You can\u2019t just pull every editorial artist and stylist\u2019s fuck it button and go *glitter*.\u2019 \n\nI \u2018retired\u2019 due to ill health. She works in Hollywood and damn she is next level. I don\u2019t get cosplay until you break it down into micro detail about wigs, make up, textures, fabrics etc and then I\u2019m \u2018OH! Makes perfect sense. No idea who Dabi is but you are a details matter to me person. Tell me more\u2026\u2019\n\nBut I\u2019m old. I used to sneak watching MTV when babysitting just to see the make up on music videos and take notes. Half the time the men were wearing the make up which is the only time the male gaze was relevant.",
