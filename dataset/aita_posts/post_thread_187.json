  "post content": "My fiance, Green (27M) and I (24F) have known each other since High school. I love him so much but he does of a tendency to Mansplain things he doesn't fully understand. Places have opened up in my area and so we went to dinner with his mother, Purple, and his sister, Pink. (14F)\n\nWe were talking at dinner when Pink started complaining how horrible her period has been and can't predict it whatsoever when it comes. She asked if i had issues with it too. Purple chimed in that irregular periods can be pretty normal. I agreed but said that if she's really concerned she could see a doctor. \n\nThis is when Green pops in suggesting his sister start taking birth control, as it helped regulate mine. I had to remind him that i had my period twice a month in high school and it was necessary. Purple also brings up she's not comfortable giving Pink birth control yet and would rather try to wait until 16 or 17. They go back and forth with Green trying to explain how he knows its best for her and is getting slightly louder in the restaurant (He's naturally a louder person). I saw Pink shrink in her seat a bit as people were looking at our table.\n\nI ended up speaking up and said, \"Okay, Green, if you can tell me right now what the R on a tampon means, you get a say on whether Pink can take birth control.\" \n\nHe stuttered and thought about it for a bit and ultimately gave up and the topic was dropped and we got on with the rest of our meal. Though his mom and sister were still giggling about it a little bit before we left. \n\nWhen we got home, he said what i did was an a**hole move and i didn't have to embarrass him like that. I told him he was getting louder and embarrassing Pink over a matter that he doesn't get a say on and knows little about. I don't think i did anything wrong but I'm starting to feel bad, and think i could've resolved it in a better way. \nAITA?\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who commented! I was so surprised to find this blown up when i woke uo today XD. I wanted to answer some quick questions.\n1. Why was this dinner conversation? I'm used to this in Green's family. They're very open people and comfortable with topics like this as long as the conversation is quiet. I love that Green can feel comfortable talking about periods and such. \n\n2. Has he gotten better about stuff like this? Yeah, but he was really bad in high school. When we got together, i told him he needed to work on this if we want a happy future together. Nowadays he catches himself or, if he doesn't, he gets quiet if you correct him. He hasn't gotten mad like this in a while and that's why i was concerned about doing this wrong this time. \n\n3. What does the R mean on a tampon and why that question? It means Regular for Regular Flow. He's picked up my products before and I remind him to either grab Regular or Super for my brand, so it was a question he could've answered. \n\nSide note: When we met, his friends (male and female) called his moments \"Mansplain Mode\" so I'm just used to calling it that. I'm sorry if i offended anyone using the word. \n\nI'll be talking to him soon. Thanks again and have a great day everyone!",

So my doctor wanted to wait obviously to see if it would settle down as for awhile after starting your period first it can take awhile to normalise but by age 14 it was still the same so i was put on the pill (i have tried a few different ones) but in my case when it was my week break it made no difference but it can and does for others but at such a young age i believe if nothing else helps then only should the pill be used.\n\nETA: to add luckily it didn't affect my growth",

Like, go take your child to an actual doctor who can judge what is an is not an appropriate means to help manage a young teenager's period. My personal interpretation of this is that was an attempt to police pink's sexual activity - and seeing as teenagers do what they want, she might actually hinder pink from making good and healthy choices regarding her sexual activity.
