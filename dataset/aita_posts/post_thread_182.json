  "post content": "My mom and dad have been separated for 26 years, their separation ended badly and resulted in her getting custody of me and my brother. My dad went down a bad path in life and chose not to see us when we were growing up, so i knew nothing about him. It wasn\u2019t until i was 18 that he had regretted it and wanted a relationship with us, i always wanted to know my dad so i agreed but i had asked my mom if she was fine with it and asked if she would go with me and she told me she was and would go with me.\n\nThe first meeting ended up really well, except my mom kept throwing in his face that he left us. I had asked her to stop because it was making us uncomfortable, that\u2019s when she got upset and started telling my dad horrible stories about me. I really didn\u2019t know how to react, i was dumbfounded. So when we left i asked her why she\u2019d tell him stories about my past and she told me that he needed to know. \n\nMy dad and i made an agreement that we would see each other at least three times out of the year since he lives a bit away from me. My mom insisted that she tag along, it wasn\u2019t an issue but my mom tends to dictate what we\u2019re going to do and how we\u2019re going to do it. She also spends over 5 hours putting on makeup to impress my dad and expects us all to wait for her. Then when we talk about events in our lives she tends to always talk badly about me. She\u2019s even gone as far as to making fun of my anxiety, claiming i don\u2019t have it and i\u2019m just a good actress to my dad. Whenever me and my dad end up in conversation, she acts almost jealous and tries to talk over me the entire time.\n\nAt one point she\u2019s gone as far as to emailing my dad lies about me, saying not to get too close to me because i\u2019m very jealous of his relationships with my family and i was manipulative. I\u2019m really not sure why she does this, especially since all i was trying to do was have a bond with my father.\n\nAfter years of her constantly putting me down to my dad i had enough. I had graduated from college and we were out celebrating me getting my degree, i asked my boyfriend if he could order my food for me because it was too loud and i have a soft spoken voice so the waiter couldn\u2019t hear me. My mom decided to make fun of me in front of my family and boyfriend then proceeded to tell my dad, who attended my graduation, that he cursed her with a daughter like me because i was so weak. At that point i just saw red because my celebration was ruined so i got up from the table and yelled \u201cAt least i\u2019m not trying to constantly chase and impress someone that doesn\u2019t want me anymore by bringing my children down!\u201d and walked out of my own party. \n\nMy mom didn\u2019t talk to me for weeks and my family says that i\u2019m an a-hole for hurting her feelings. I felt bad about how things went down but i also don\u2019t feel like i was entirely wrong either. AITA?",
