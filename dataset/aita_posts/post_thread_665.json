  "post content": "Throwaway account since she uses Reddit. \n\nSo me (24M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been living together for almost 2 years. When we first moved out she bought us a brand new bed and bed frame because ours were both old. She also got us all this new expensive bedding which I admit is nice, but a little ridiculous she spent almost $700 on sheets, pillows and a duvet and stuff like that from a bedding store when you can get ones from Costco or Amazon for pretty cheap. But whatever it\u2019s her money. Anyways, she bought us each 2 new pillows and I do use the memory foam one but I wanted to keep one of my old pillows from my parents place because it\u2019s I really like it. My mom gave it to me when I was 10 and she had it in her bed for about 5 years before that. \n\nNow to the issue: \n\nMy girlfriend is really particular about the bed, she always has been. She likes it very clean and made a specific way every day. She changes the sheets twice a week and is always washing the mattress cover to make sure it\u2019s as clean as can be. She also never lets either of us get into bed without a shower. I understand that though since I work in trades and get pretty dirty. So needless to say she thought my pillow was kind of gross. She likes to replace her pillows every few years and she can\u2019t believe I have this pillow that\u2019s 19 years old. She put up with it for a while but I came home from work on Friday and when I went to go to bed I noticed the pillow she got for me 2 years ago that I never opened was now on the bed in place of my old pillow. When I asked her about it she told me she got rid of it because she couldn\u2019t handle sleeping next to my dirty pillow any more. I thought this was ridiculous and proceeded to yell at her for being childish. I do feel bad for yelling but I\u2019m really upset she just threw away my pillow. I really don\u2019t see the issue with my old pillow.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEDIT 2: I also want to say this item wasn\u2019t sentimental to me or anything, my mother is still alive and well and I didn\u2019t really tie the pillow to her in any way. It was just a comfortable pillow that I really liked and I haven\u2019t been able to find anywhere that sells a pillow that has the same feel to it. Regardless of that though it was something I liked and I do t think it was right for her I just throw it away. I could have used it somewhere else\u2026\n\nEdit 3: for those of you wondering, the pillow is not down, it\u2019s some kind of fibre\u2026. Not sure what kind\n\nEdit 4: so the comment section seems pretty torn about who is right or how we both suck. I still wasn\u2019t sure what to do so I called my mom late last night and she reamed me out for owning a pillow that was so old. She\u2019s backing up my girlfriend, I guess she feels the same way about pillows. She was under the impression I had gotten rid of it years ago when she got me new pillows to replace my old ones when I was 13. Here I thought I was just getting extra pillows all these years. She was pretty dumbfounded I still had this pillow and told me I shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her or even made a big deal about any of this at all because my girlfriend is right. Even my mother knows how my girlfriend is about the bed since she noticed how clean my bed started to be when I started bringing my girlfriend around my parents house, and my mother noticed pretty quickly. She asked me why I care so much and I didn\u2019t really have an answer other than \u201cI liked it\u201d. She, and the other YTA comments made me realize I was probably more in the wrong then my girlfriend. \n\nI can see now how she put up with it for an extended amount of time and I shouldn\u2019t have been so stubborn. There was no real reason I wanted to keep this pillow. She would never throw away anything of mine with sentimental value, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t compare this old pillow to my old favourite childhood stuffy I still have and very much treasure. There are reasons I\u2019m not going to get into as to why she\u2019s so particular and OCD about the bed. It doesn\u2019t really extend to other areas of the house. She likes it clean obviously, but she\u2019s not that particular about anything else but the bed so I don\u2019t really think that calls for therapy or a professional. She\u2019s made a lot of compromises for me so I can do this for her.",

If you\u2019re pissing on or having sex on your family heirlooms that\u2019s a you thing. Almost no one else is using great grandmas handmade quilt from 1910 as a sex mat or toilet\u2026.. this also was not an heirloom. A 19 year old pillow that only had its first wash 2 years ago is not the same as a quilt used occasionally on the couch that you take very good care of and have cleaned regularly. I have a quilt that has been passed down to me. It\u2019s almost 70 years old. My great grandma made for my grandma, she gave it to my dad and I got it from him. It sits on my couch and barely gets used. There is not a single stain on it and the colours are still so vibrant. She made it out of old clothes from all the children in the family. She actually made 5 of them all by hand. \n\nThis man\u2019s gross old pillow is in no way at the same level as an heirloom like that. Linens can be cleaned adequately and high quality ones can be used for years. Pillows can not. OP himself even said it was not down, it was probably just some cheap pillow from Walmart or something like that. \n\nIf OP really wanted to keep the pillow, he should have tried to come to a compromise sooner. OP even said himself in a comment his GF gave him suggestions like buying a pillow protector and OP shut her down. He wouldn\u2019t budge at all, or in his words \u201cstood his ground\u201d.",
