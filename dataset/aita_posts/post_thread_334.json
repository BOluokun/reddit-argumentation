  "post content": "I have a close friend from college who's getting married, and she's been asking for my help to contribute to her wedding. I think it's sweet that she's thinking of me, but I don't think it's a good idea for me to help out financially. \n\nMy friend and I have been close for a few years now, and I'm happy for her. She is struggling financially, and they have asked that instead of wedding gifts, people can donate to parts of their wedding ceremony (theres a registry and everything, like \u201ctable flowers\u201d and stuff). I'm know she's trying to save as much money as possible for certain reasons unrelated to the wedding. But I just don't think it's right for me to be helping her out with the costs at this time. I'm a recent doctorate candidate (soon), am currently writing a memoir, and I dont know when I will have time to get a job - anything I give is just that much less time I can live on my own. Even if I could afford it, I don't think it's fair that I should have to help out when I know her fiance already has a job and could definitely get another, and some of his friends seem well off.\n\nI tried to explain my financial situation to my friend, but she's still asking for help, even a little. She suggested that I could contribute a much smaller amount than others, but I still don't think it's a good idea. I told her that if I was in a better financial situation I would be more than happy to help out, but right now it just isn't possible. \n\nMy friend got really mad at me and said that I was selfish, and that she expected more from me.  Our group of friends all pledged to help pay for each others weddings back in college, and she says that since she helped pay for my wedding ($550), that I should help her out, even if it's just $20. She is also threatening to tell our group of friends, just because all of them contributed to my wedding - but she completely ignores the fact that my marriage didn\u2019t last even one year.\n\nI don't want to lose her friendship, and I really don\u2019t want her to tell our friends - my financial situation is private. More importantly, I also don't want to be taken advantage of. AITA for not wanting to help pay for her wedding?\n\n***Edit: ok, after seeing all the reactions and misunderstandings here, I talked with a couple other friends in our group and showed them the post. They sent me some money ($100) to give to our friend for her wedding. I\u2019m going to offer $5 at first and see if that is enough.\n\nCouple other points: \n - My friends fianc\u00e9 agreed to purchase my ticket to fly, so giving up that money and not going is not an option\n - My friend did also give me a wedding gift which I returned\n - I do not have the money for a wedding gift, but I believe being there for her on her big day is a present itself - everyone laughs when I say \u201cmy presence is present enough\u201d so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as negative as others see it.\n - I have not been accepted into a school yet, I am starting to apply for PHD programs. I\u2019m writing a memoir as a tribute and gift back for my experiences - and doing it now to prepare to become a doctor.\n\n***Edit 2: to clarify, I understood the $100 is to be used for ALL friend weddings in our group, not just the one now. I am NOT just pocketing the money. I am saving it for when others get married and that means I have to try to ration it out, for lack of a better word.\n\nNote - there are only three people left in the group who are unmarried: my friend, one other person, and myself.\n\n***EDIT 3: A LOT of people are asking about my memoir. I won\u2019t be sharing details here so as to not take it off topic. Anyone can DM me for more info though\n\n***Edit 4: I offered the $5, and didn\u2019t hear back for a couple days. So today I offered $20 as a gesture of good will, without waiting to hear about the $5. She said no, and even had the audacity to tell me I didn\u2019t need to come to her wedding at all! I offered $25, then $50. Still nothing she just seemed to get more upset even when I INCREASED the amount. Idk what she expects literally more than double what she asked for, and it isn\u2019t enough?",

She\u2019s asking for parts of the wedding **as** the shower and wedding gifts. \n\nAt this point, registering for non-traditional things (like cash funds, honeymoon experiences, etc) isn\u2019t even uncommon. I gifted one of my friends the personalized cake serving set she wanted to use at her wedding, because it was on her registry for her bridal shower. And we gave them cash to pay for their honeymoon as a wedding gift, cause that\u2019s what they wanted. Fewer and fewer people are asking for crock pots and china, because most of us have all that stuff by the time we get married. Nothing wrong with asking for what they actually want and need, even if that thing is cash to pay off the wedding!",

Honestly OP is right not to want to lose a friend like that. OP YTA. Tell her you will be there to help with as much of the laborious stuff as you can because you can give your time for free and get $50 together to give to her. It sounds like she would be very accepting of that but you don\u2019t even want to offer a tiny amount for some reason. Two questions, firstly have you contributed to any of the others weddings (it sounds like a number of them put in for yours) and secondly do you dislike her fianc\u00e9 or something?
