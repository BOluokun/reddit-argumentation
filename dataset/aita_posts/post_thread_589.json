  "post content": "I (f20) have been living at my parents\u2019 home since January after deciding to take a year off of university. Initially, it was to recover from a concussion (oof didn\u2019t know how hard uni was when your brain isn\u2019t working), but I would like to work so that I can actually pay for my last semester of uni myself, instead of relying on my parents. I truly appreciate that they have supported me financially throughout my university years. I\u2019ve worked every semester/summer except when I was abroad, but it definitely did not cover all of my costs. \n\nSo, my parents both work in juvenile rehabilitations (colloquially known as juvie). My father has worked in the field all my life, and my mother started working in it when I was finishing high school. Their facility has three lodges, and they are both supervisors, but in different lodges. \n\nWhen I was younger I had always talked about wanting to work in the same field. When I moved back in, I joked about applying to be an \u201con call\u201d security officer there. My mother told me it would be a bad idea, as well as my brother in law (who also lives here part of the time and works as an adult on call). My brother\u2019s primary reasoning is that I am a young women, and that I am too nice. My mother\u2019s reasoning is that it would be difficult for her and my father to supervise me because I am their daughter (my counter is that they already supervise their son in law), and that the negative/sexist comments from the boys (it is a male only facility) would get to her too much. My father, while not necessarily supportive of me applying, helped me with my application, pro/conned the position, and has been generally level headed about the situation. \n\nI had mostly forgotten about applying because it\u2019s been a few weeks. I\u2019ll be honest, I was pretty butthurt about my mom\u2019s reaction. I\u2019ve heard the complaints from her about stupid coworkers who don\u2019t know how to work with youth and I HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH AT RISK YOUTH. I understand that she has a point, but I don\u2019t think these boys will ever improve if the tactic for making them treat younger women like humans instead of objects is isolation from said women. I understand that it\u2019s gonna be hecka hard for me to make them me respect me (is respect \u201cearned\u201d in this circumstance?) but I sure would like to try.\n\nSo here\u2019s my combined a-hole question, I think I may have been one for not getting over her not supporting me applying (that\u2019s her prerogative), but WIBTA if I accept the job offer (I\u2019m interviewing this Wednesday)?",

Most JD youth I've worked with would never dare fight a female anyway, it makes them look bad.\n\nThat said, I see where your mom is coming from, at least in terms of being in the same workplace. It's a whole other thing to have to see and hear the comments and behavior towards you, and try to supervise you as your mother. That could be a difficult conflict for her professionally.",

At work, your mom isn't your mom, she's your supervisor--given you've said that you had a hard time getting over her not supporting your application, how would you react if she criticized your job performance? Would you evaluate the criticism honestly and improve or assume your mom was just trying to undermine you? Would you spend weeks dwelling on how unfair it is? It is *really hard* to have family stay at home and work stay at work--inevitably \"your mom\" and \"your supervisor\" are going to start bleeding together. And your mom's already indicated that she might have a hard time separating \"her daughter\" from \"her staff member.\"",
