  "post content": "I (21f) has always had the T-phobia of being scared of holes/shapes. Just the name of the phobia gives me goosebumps. Fair warning, don't look it up if you don't know what it is because it's how mine started from a very young, stupid age of not heeding warnings. Curiosity did kill the cat in me and there's not resurrection back from it.\n\nMy ex-bestfriend knew this because she was the one who told me about it and 'encouraged' me to look it up. I don't blame her because we were young and she's not afraid of the phobia so I think she didn't know everyone was the same as her.\n\nMy anxiety doesn't get triggered when I look at honeycombs or the seeds on strawberries or lotus, but I did lose my appetite on those black little sesame-looking dots on king crab legs. Specific, I know. \n\nEx-bestfriend is getting married by the end of Nov despite the pandemic, but it's supposed to be a close-knitted, private wedding and everyone will follow guidelines. I was hesitant at first, but she was my BF so I did more research on how to be safer. \n\nWe've (bridesmaids, MOH, and bride)  been on vid-call a lot to fix some last-minute emergencies that were out of our control. Everyone's stressed, but because they're in a city with concerningly high positive test rates, they're extra stressed while I live in an okay city so there's not a lot of cases. So, technically, I'm not as stressed as the bride and MOH. \n\nI must've looked relaxed during the last vid call because the bride (ex-bf) was asking me to help out more and it's a mean thing to sit back relaxing while everyone's stress and anxiety level is really high. I told her that I literally can't be there to help because I'm in a different state. \n\nMaybe I was too snappy, so I apologized and offered to help with things that can be done over the net.  She was still silent and suddenly she just popped a T-phobia image in the vid call. I was taken aback and scream what the fuck is she doing! I ended the call, I couldn't scrub the goosebumps off my arms and I physically felt nauseous. I texted her why she did that and ex-bf said it's what I get for rubbing my 'relaxation' in her face.\n\nI don't take lightly of my fears, and she knows about this particular fear that I had to get therapy for and still in. I told her to apologize to me, she doesn't because 'I deserved it'. I felt disrespected and frankly, disgusted with the image and with her behavior. \n\nI said I'm not comfortable attending her wedding anymore, and now I got everyone blowing up my phone saying I can't do that when it's so close to the wedding. Changes can be expensive and possibly delay the wedding, but I feel that I deserve basic respect.\n\n*ESL*.",
