  "post content": " \n\nHey reddit community,\n\nfirst of all I\u00b4m sorry if I do some rookie mistakes in my post. It\u00b4s my first reddit post ever and I\u00b4m not a native speaker.\n\nA few weeks ago I visited a girl I was already dating over a short time about two years ago. It didn\u00b4t work out because I went to Australia after we finished school and she left our hometown to study. Anyway recently I saw some Instagram post from her being back in town so I wrote her and she invited me to visit her in the city where she\u00b4s now studying.\n\nThe visit was great. We went out, had a lot of fun and hooked up. I didn\u00b4t really expect our connection to be that good after having no contact for two years. It really felt like we were on the same level on everything. We also had some really deep talk about live and so on. I never thought she was the kind of person who you could talk to about stuff like that.\n\nTherefore after I came back I thought a lot about her and I talked with some of my close friends about her. Of course I was asked if we had sex. And I just didn\u00b4t have the mental strength to deny it. I don\u00b4t hook up very often and that weekend was very special for me. I didn\u00b4t brag about it, but I didn't want to lie to my friends either.\n\nLast saturday she sent me a screenshot where a friend of her, and I thought of me too, sent her this:\n\n**\"LOL, didn\u00b4t know that \\[my name\\] came up to visit you and fuck you. xD xD\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told her I never said to anyone that I only visited to fuck her and that I\u00b4m really sorry that she got a message like this. I asked my friends who told that rumor around and one guy tells me that he was at the same party as the guy who sent the text. He told that dude that I visited her, but not that we hooked up. Apparently he guessed that by himself. The shitty thing on top of all that is that another guy visited her and told everybody they hooked up although they didn\u00b4t.\n\nShe didn\u00b4t answer me for three days so I sent another voice message explaining that I only talked with close friends about the weekend and never braged about it public or stuff like that. I told her that I\u00b4m really sorry and that it would suck if we never had contact again beacause of this shit. She didn\u00b4t even listen to it.\n\nI know I\u00b4m kind of the asshole here because if I had kept my mouth shut there wouln\u00b4t be any rumor at all. On the other side I think the real dickhead is the guy who sent her that text. Who talks to a close friend like that? \"He visited you to fuck you lol\". Seriously?\n\nIs it justified for her to ghost me forever? I mean we are not 16 anymore and it shouln\u00b4t be such a drama if people know we hooked up? I really understand that she\u00b4s pissed, and I told her that I\u00b4m angry at myself for that shit that happend but in the end it\u00b4s just others people gossip is it? And she doesen\u00b4t even live in this city anymore and said that she\u00b4s not in contact with these people anyway.\n\n*I\u00b4m really torn apart if I\u00b4m such an asshole here that she\u00b4s justified to break up contact like this.*\n\nThanks for any constructive comments.\n\nEdit 1: Concerning the motive of the guy who sent her the text: He actually knows her very long and I think she considers him as a good friend. Once at a party He told me: \"If you want her go for it, when she's that drunk it's so easy. I know him since two years and we played online games together a lot in the past. He has a girlfriend since two years. I  can't really explain myself his motive except complete ignorance about beeing such a dick to her and to me.\n\nEdit 2: Concerning how she talks about sex: She was very open, you could talk with her about anything. At one point during the weekend I saw a message from one of her girlfriends saying: \"Have fun you two <3\". I don't know for sure if it was ment sexually, but I wouldn't  be suprised if it was.",
