  "post content": "So my s/o knows I never cared for dogs, they\u2019re just not my cup of tea. I wouldn\u2019t harm one what so ever. I just don\u2019t like to be around them.  I don\u2019t find them cute. Entertaining or lovable.  The majority of them  gross me out.  (For some reason I do really love pugs) Plus the fact that I\u2019m extremely allergic to them anyway. \n\n\nMy s/o and his ex share a dog, he normally gets the dog one week every month.  I\u2019ve met the dog once. It was a nightmare, it constantly wanted to be around me no matter how much I tried to ignore it and not make eye contact. And I got the worst allergies ever. It sucked existing around it.  But I endured. I didn\u2019t treat it badly. I always ended up either moving away from it or picking it up and putting it back on the floor whenever it wanted to snuggle me. \n\nMy s/o always hyped up his dog.  And that\u2019s cool. I get loving your pet.  I just don\u2019t really care to hype up the pet with him.  Today is his week with his dog, and he tried to get me excited about it. And hype up with him. I gave him a monotoned \u201cyay\u201d and replied \u201ccool\u201d while on my phone. Honestly not really caring. He got upset telling me that I could at least try to be excited for him.  I responded by being sarcastic and faking enthusiasm which made him even more upset.  So now he\u2019s ignoring me and playing with his dog and making passive aggressive remarks everytime I pass by.  Like \u201cit\u2019s okay. The majority of us love you being here\u201d while glaring at me. Which got under my skin in which I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t care about your damn dog\u201d\n\nI just feel like I haven\u2019t done anything wrong. He knew from day one that I don\u2019t care about dogs.  That includes his dog. Did he think just because I love him means id love his dog?",
