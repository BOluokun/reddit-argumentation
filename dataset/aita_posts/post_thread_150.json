  "post content": "Odd title I know. \n\nI haven't done it yet but I want to put up a garden fence on my side of the property line in order to prevent my neighbor from mowing my property. The reasons why are:\n\n1.) My neighbor uses a large riding lawn mower to take care of their yard and often mows a portion of my yard in order to avoid items in their backyard (trailer parked right by - but not on the property line, trampoline placed 6 inches from line). \n\n2.) About a week ago they mowed and damaged one of my sprinkler heads. It didn't cause my yard to flood and I was able to fix it without having to replace it, but it was still annoying. I saw my neighbor do it, notice that they did it and move on. \n\n3.) They recently (within the last 12 months) moved in, and we have waved and said hello to them but they have ignored us. They are friendly with other people in the neighborhood by seem to ignore us and the other neighbors who share a property line with them. \n\n4.) They tore out the property boundary stick between our house and theirs. There is a hole where is was and I want to place something (anything) in that spot before the hole fills in. \n\nI want to separate out my assumptions because they are based on my observations which may be different than what the neighbor is actually doing (two sides to each story and whatnot).\n\nFirst, I have a feeling they are trying to slowly encroach on to our property. They have the smallest lot and have it full of stuff (shed, trailer, trampoline, boat, etc.) and we have the largest lot and keep it pretty empty. Secondly, they don't seem to respect our property since they damaged our sprinkler. Lastly, they haven't been very friendly to us and I want to create a barrier between us and them. \n\nI am not a large fence person, in fact based on city rules I can't fence a large portion of my yard. I have planted trees between us but can't have them on the property line. I am allowed to place a small decorative garden fence. For reference they are those two to three feet tall metal fences that can be hammered into the ground, they are 100% decorative. I want to place it on our property to prevent them from mowing our yard. I would plant shrubs and flowers next to it so it doesn't look stupid.\n\nI have told family and friends this idea and they seem to be split on if I am being a petty asshole. So am I?",

Some of the spray hit the plants on his side of the fence, too, and now those plants around his pool pump & stuff have died.  We're still fighting it in a number of other places along that back area, though.  \n\nThis neighbor also originally routed his pool backwash to drain into our yard because he didn't want to pay the fee to drain it into the city sewer.  He disguised the pipes, and we didn't figure it out until a huge trench had been cut into our yard -- but we caught him doing it one day and put a stop to it.  He's also routed other stuff to drain across our yard.  He's a thoroughly horrible neighbor.\n\nOP, you are absolutely NTA.

We offered to help pay for that section of fence because we didn't want it to look stupid.. we came out a few days later to them cutting the fence in half with a chainsaw. Completely ruined our fence, and then built their fence 7 ft tall when bylaws said only 6ft. We had a lot of issues with them but this was the biggest issue I can recall.
