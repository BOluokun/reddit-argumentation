  "post content": "My (39f) daughter very recently had her 17th birthday. My husband (42m) and I told her to pick out a restaurant that she'd like us to take her to for her birthday.\n\nShe chose a seafood restaurant that we'd never been to. In looking over the menu I saw that the vast majority of the dishes contained shellfish. There were a few fish entrees, as well as some surf and turf. But there were only a couple of non-seafood dishes.\n\nOur son (15m) is deathly allergic to shellfish. He also can't stand fish. There were only a couple of dishes there that he could actually eat. I didn't want to take him there because I knew that he wouldn't really enjoy his meal and I was worried about cross contamination.\n\nI told my daughter that this restaurant wouldn't work and that she would have to pick out a different one. My son said that he would be fine just staying home; that we could use the money that we would have spent on his meal to just order him a pizza instead. My husband also insisted that since it was our daughter's birthday that she should be able to choose the restaurant, and that our son would be fine home alone with pizza and videogames.\n\nBut here's the thing; we can only afford to go out as a family every so often. When we splurge on a restaurant meal, I want BOTH of our children there. I insisted and my daughter chose a different place and we had a nice meal AS A FAMILY. But she is still a little salty that she didn't get to have her first choice of restaurants.\n\nMost people I've asked say I'm wrong. But, again, we can only afford to go out every so often. Is it so wrong that I wanted to do it as a family? My daughter still had a nice birthday meal.\n\n&#x200B;",

      "content": "YTA for a lot of reasons. First, if you were going to put parameters on her choice, you should have told her that beforehand. Second, you seem more hung up on the fact that your son wouldn\u2019t like the food than his allergy. Your son\u2019s preferences are irrelevant. This is your daughter\u2019s day. He seems to understand that, but you don\u2019t. Third, if you were really concerned about cross-contamination, you could have called ahead to discuss your concerns and see what precautions the restaurant would be willing to take. If that isn\u2019t satisfying (which would be perfectly understandable), your son offered to stay home. \n\nI get that you want to have a family meal, but all you have done is tell your daughter that she is not worth individual celebration. This could have been a great opportunity for you and your husband to have individual time with your 17-year-old\u2014 a rare opportunity. Instead, you squandered that, created unnecessary conflict, and possibly formed resentment between your daughter and her brother.",

As long as there is something on the menu she can eat, even if it is not preferred, then that is the restaurant we go to. Your family's economic condition is not your daughter's problem. That is your problem. \n\nOP, you are a MASSIVE YTA. Do you honestly not think your daughter will resent you for this? She clearly likes seafood. She chose this restaurant because SHE wants to try it on HER birthday. Its not the family's birthday. Its her birthday and there WAS something her brother could safely eat on the menu. So, you have the birthday girl, the one person who the day is supposed to be about, once again changing plans to make life more comfortable - not safe, but more comfortable - for the person in the family who life pretty much revolves around. The reason she will resent you is because this is clearly a pattern of behavior on your part -- she is expected to set aside her own wishes for the convenience of others.\n\nAs a teen there are precious few times in life they get agency to make a choice like what restaurant you go to. It sounds like that is the family tradition - the birthday kid chooses the restaurant - and once again you robbed her of HER choice to make HER decision based upon HER preference to make someone else happy at HER expense. Is this really the lesson you want to teach her? Because once again, you taught your 17 year old daughter that her wishes do not matter and someone else's wishes are more important. Not someone else's needs because his needs would have been met at the restaurant but you taught her that on what should have been her day that her wishes don't matter nearly as much as someone else's. That is a dangerous lesson to  be teaching your daughter. \n\nYou owe her an apology and this weekend YOUR HUSBAND should take your daughter out to that restaurant. Clearly it wasn't important enough for you to do as a family so send the person who actually supports your daughter out to the restaurant with her. You and your son can stay home and eat pizza.",
