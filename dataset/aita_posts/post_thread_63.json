  "post content": "This couple I\u2019m not very close with but the wife is a long-time family friend so I felt that I should invite her. To be clear, all of my invitations stated that there were to be no children at this wedding. But she and her husband showed up with their infant and toddler (who I think is like 3-4). \n\nAt the actual wedding ceremony, I let it slide. I was preoccupied for obvious reasons. I also thought that maybe they planned not to attend the reception or to have someone pick the kids up before it started. (My niece, who was our flower girl, and a few other kids who had to be at the wedding for one reason or another we\u2019re getting picked up/dropped off after the ceremony ended). \n\nAnyway the reception rolls around (I\u2019m fast forwarding through irrelevant details about the wedding but it was beautiful and everything went as smoothly as could be expected). The couple comes and, lo and behold, they still have their children.\n\nI had many other guests and didn\u2019t really feel like dealing with it so I asked our event planner to go over to them and discuss whether someone was picking up the child as the reception (and wedding, frankly!) were not supposed to have children. \n\nI mean, everyone was drinking and loud and rowdy and  a crying child and another little one running around was not part of the plan. (The infant  already had to be taken out once during the wedding ceremony because of fussiness and the toddler was, from what I could see, already appearing cranky). \n\nMy event planner went to talk to the couple. I could tell they were arguing with my event planner though so I went over to help him. I think they thought I came to rescue them because they started going on about how rude my event planner was. I explained that I had actually sent him over to discuss the children. I reiterated that the event was child-free and said that I had stated so clearly on my invitations. \n\nThe wife gave a sort of apology and then assured me that they were capable of minding their own children to make sure they didn\u2019t get in the way of anything. I said that wasn\u2019t really the point. That\u2019s when my now-husband comes over and he and the other woman\u2019s husband begin going back and forth and things got a little heated. \n\nFinally I snapped and said that they just needed to go, which, thankfully they did without much more noise. Still, the whole scene was incredibly embarrassing which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. \n\nI really hate that my wedding day had to be somewhat marred by this incident. According to my mother, everyone was talking about it and I guess enjoying a little dramatic entertainment. \n\nWas I the a-hole for making them leave?\n\n**Edit 1: Wow um this kind of blew up out of nowhere. Thank you all so much for the feedback. What I\u2019ve gotten from this is that most people think that the couple was rude. There are also a select few who feel that it\u2019s assholish to have a kid-free wedding at all which is...interesting.**\n\n**By way of an update, I have now learned that a few family members felt that it was inappropriate of me to kick out the couple. (The wife apparently is still angry about getting kicked out and the husband is FALSELY telling people that we threatened to call the cops on them). No one has said anything directly to me though.**\n\n**Anyway the feedback here has helped me not to feel guilty about that and just realize that not everyone has the same ideas about tact and manners.** \n\n**Edit 2: Well apparently this went somewhat viral and has now been in articles on Fox News, DailyMail, and Yahoo News. Many thanks to those in the comments who let me know! I had used a throwaway account to stay anonymous and lowkey, but I guess that\u2019s out the window lol. No point in deleting now, so whoever sees it, sees it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
