  "post content": "I\u2019m 33 and I had a serious drinking problem since a young age. My dad was an alcoholic so booze never lacked in our house. It nearly killed me when I was only 27 and was in the ER for alcohol poisoning. \nIt was too close a call and after that things had to change. With my wife\u2019s support, I went to rehab and proud to say I\u2019ve been sober 5 1/2yrs. \n\nMy flatmate invited our friends over yesterday. It was 7 of us in total, including his friend, \u201cMark.\u201d I\u2019ve met Mark maybe 3-4 times over the last 2 years and while we\u2019re \u201cfriendly\u201d i honestly don\u2019t know him that well. But you can tell he\u2019s a party-guy. Likes to get loud, take shots, makes gross comments sometimes, etc.\n\nMark brought several cases of beer and a bottle of tequila with him so everyone was drinking and having a good time. \n\nMark kept offering me drinks the entire night, which I\u2019d politely decline. It\u2019s like he made it his personal mission to get me to drink by egging me on, saying everytime he sees me I\u2019m either drinking a soda/water and it\u2019s okay to let loose sometimes. He resorted to teasing me into drinking, calling me \u201cprincess\u201d; I don\u2019t know what that had to do with not wanting to drink.\n\nAll my friends there knew what I was like before, how bad my drinking was so they kept trying to steer the conversation so he\u2019d forget about me. But every now and then he\u2019d hand me a shot glass or a beer and would not let it go even after telling him yet again that I didn\u2019t want to drink. \n\nMy wife became uncomfortable with his behavior (I think she was worried I\u2019d actually drink). She grabbed the shot glass from me, dumped it in the sink and told him to stop it already. He looked between us and grinned like he \u201cunderstood now\u201d. \n\nMark joked that maybe we should get my wife drunk first, then that\u2019ll get her to loosen up the leash she has on me. I\u2019ll admit, that made me see red. I got in his face and told him, \u201cactually I don\u2019t drink because last time I did I almost f*cking died so unless you want me puking everywhere and having seizures you should shut up and leave my wife out of this.\u201d\n\nWiped the smile off him real quick and he apologized. The rest of night went on and he finally left me alone. \n\nOur flatmate did confront me in the morning because he thinks I was too honest with Mark and it wasn\u2019t his fault he didn\u2019t know; he was just joking around and I made him feel bad. Our other friends agree he was being too pushy and deserved being told off, my wife agrees so he\u2019s the only one right now that\u2019s taking Mark\u2019s side.\n\nHe said I could\u2019ve ignored him until he gave up instead of bringing up an uncomfortable truth from my past. \n\nNow yes I could\u2019ve just told Mark the truth without full details but felt that\u2019s none of his business and a \u201cno\u201d should\u2019ve been enough. \n\nI only got carried away when he decided to include my wife in his jokes. So yes I am wondering if I was a bit of an a-hole for what I told him instead of keeping the peace.",

He disrespected you by badgering you to drink and he disrespected your wife. No one needs a reason to not do something but since Mark clearly wasn't going to stop pushing you you were well within the right to tell him exactly why you didn't want to drink.",

They drink every weekend to excess, and hey, on \"special occasions\" under the week, too. \n\nAnd it's fine. \n\nEverybody drinks! Drinking is part of being social, and drinking to get drunk is part of party culture. And if they are drinking a bit more frequently, a bit more heavily than others, well, that's just them being the heart of the party, the party animal, the guy or gal who knows how to have a good time. They are just on the higher end of \"the average\".\n\nAnd then you, or I, come in. And ... we don't drink. And we don't drink despite not having a \"legitimate reason\", like being the designated driver, like being pregnant, like being of a prohibitive faith. We just don't want to, and don't really feel we *have* to to have fun, either. \n\nAnd that's terrible. For them.\n\nBecause suddenly here we are ruining the average by introducing the concept of \"not drinking\". Suddenly not *everybody* is drinking, unless they are forced to not drink by circumstance. The low end isn't \"getting slightly drunk\" anymore, with the higher end being \"blackout drunk\", suddenly the low end is being sober. And in this new spectrum, their excess looks all the more extreme. Because when there's the option to not drink, isn't there also the option to drink *less*? Because if you introduce the concept of being social and having fun *without* being drunk, doesn't that put into question a culture that insists that being social means you have to always be drinking at social outings? Because if it's possible and enjoyable to not drink, is their copious consumption of alcohol less loveable character trait and more indication of, perhaps, a problem?\n\nAnd that's where that missionary zeal comes from. We have to be converted, we have to be brought around, we have to become the \"everybody\" that is drinking. Because hoping to bully people into being part of the status quo, to validate drinking culture, is easier than to take a good, critical look at one's own behavior.",

One of my closest friends is a bit over a year sober (I actually want to say almost 2 yrs, yay her!), and she has talked about how many \"friends\" she lost over quitting several things that she was abusing. As a personal choice I dropped several mutual friends of ours because they did crap like this. I watched another ex-friend drink herself into a miscarriage after quite a few hospitilizations for severe problems caused by her drinking. I was the only person willing to not serve/drink with her during her pregnancy and after. I believe she is now sober. \n\nMy point is, I have 0 tolerance for pushers/enablers because it literally wrecks lives and kills people. I honestly can't stand to watch it, it disgusts me to watch people push drinking/drugs (or even just stand by/drink with) people who clearly have a problem, because not drinking/partying and seeing others choose not to makes them uncomfortable. I am totally ok with people choosing to do those things, and I drink myself still (heavy drinker for yrs, verging on alcoholism) I drink in front of the close sober friend, and she is aware and ok with it, but I have told her I will never be the reason if she ever breaks her sobriety.\n\nSorry for my rant, but I feel strongly about this. I have experienced how deeply ingrained recreational partying is in US society, and again totally fine with people who do, many of my friends do, it is not a judgement on the drinking/drugs. But we HAVE to normalize people choosing to not do those even in party atmospheres. Even if it isn't a choice made because they have a problem, saying no to things you are uncomfortable with or don't like should be acceptable and defended from AHs like Mark. Dude is toxic at the very least, and I'd go as far as misogynistic for the attitude when he thought it was the GF \"running things\". I literally can't think of anything nice to say about this guy, he sounds awful.",

      "content": "Mark sounds like a total dick, but he apologised and stopped at least.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even sound like your mate is on Mark\u2019s side because Mark apologised and stopped so even he realised he was being a dick\n\nJust seems like it\u2019s this \u2018mate\u2019 is out on his own trying to defend untenable behaviour, and I\u2019d wager that what he\u2019s actually upset about is \u201cyou being honest and reacting to my guest being a dick made me feel uncomfortable because I feel vicariously responsible for my friend\u2019s social comfort to the extent that I\u2019m willing to let you be treated like shit as long as it\u2019s not creating any discomfort for me\u201d\n\nMark was being a dick. Mark feels bad because he knows this. It\u2019s socially appropriate for Mark to feel bad about his actions in this scenario. Feeling bad will lead Mark to reflect on what he did and will probably make him reconsider him acting this way again. It doesn\u2019t make him a totally unsalvageably terrible person, it means his behaviour wasn\u2019t kind or reasonable. Your friend\u2019s need to never have Mark feel bad even when it\u2019s appropriate isn\u2019t going to help Mark grow and learn from these situations. \n\nSo yeah NTA, I\u2019d even say at this point that Mark isn\u2019t the asshole anymore, but your mate needs to reassess how he\u2019s handling this. \n\nIf you want some language to go back to your mate with, here\u2019s what I\u2019d say: \n\n\u201cMark was being rude all night. It\u2019s common knowledge that some people can\u2019t or don\u2019t drink for private reasons - alcoholism, medication, pregnancy, religion. No one should have to disclose their private information in order to not have booze forced on them. I think you can agree that\u2019s reasonable. I think it\u2019s a normal and healthy response that Mark feels bad about his actions - maybe he\u2019ll be more mindful of people\u2019s circumstances before acting like that again. Last night you didn\u2019t step in when your guest was repeatedly rude to me, which is on you. You could have pulled him to one side and asked him to leave it be, but you didn\u2019t. Your discomfort at a slightly awkward social situation doesn\u2019t outweigh my right to feel safe and not have my recovery threatened in my home.\u201d\n\nThis is a point of personal preference (and I certainly wouldn\u2019t say an obligation) but if I were you I\u2019d consider whether there is some language you\u2019re comfortable with using about drinking earlier on in situations like this so you\u2019re not getting to the point where your night is being ruined and you and your wife are anxious and upset. Like if you\u2019re offered a drink a second time you could say something then to signal that you don\u2019t want to be asked. \n\nIt could be \u201cI\u2019m in recovery so I\u2019d prefer if no-one offered me a drink, thanks\u201d but also if you\u2019d rather not disclose that (totally reasonable) then \u201cI can\u2019t drink for medical reasons - I\u2019d don\u2019t want to go into it but I\u2019m sticking with the soft drinks\u201d",

          "content": "I agree that OP is NTA at all, but sometimes it helps to have a reason tucked under your belt for just in case. Pushy assholes are sadly frequent, especially at parties. Not that you ever owe anyone a reason, and a \"no\" should absolutely be reason enough, but if comfortable with it, an added \"no thanks, I'm teetotal\" or whatever can help. My uncle doesn't drink alcohol, solely because he hates how it makes him feel, and he usually just says \"no thanks I don't drink\" and that's \\*usually\\* enough, even if some people love to ask the ol' \"why?\". \n\nAlways reminds me of the old Jim Gaffigan sketch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIQ4nOvCkVc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIQ4nOvCkVc)\n\n\"You don't use mayonnaise?

Immediately realized I was TA, apologized (like Mark did) and took that into future situations and thought twice about how I was acting.

This makes for a much less awkward situation and less of the night uncomfortable. There's no need to let Mark take it all the way to insulting your wife.\n\nPeople generally aren't trying to be mean and make your night crappy, they just want everyone else to let loose and have a good time. You can early on let them know that you're having a good time and don't need/want booze to do it.",
