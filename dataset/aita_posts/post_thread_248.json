We're having another and when I had my ultrasound, I was told it was another girl, again my husband was Happy. Turns out I was told wrong, and it's actually a boy we're having, ny my husband freaked out in excitemet.\n\nHis reaction to us having a boy was *nothing* like his either of his reactions to having a girl. He was actually jumping around and yelling, he immediately called all his friends and family, he kept hugging and swinging our daughter around telling her she's getting a brother.\n\nI confronted him about not being this excited about having girls, and he said \u201ccause I wanted a boy \u201d. I got so pissed off, I don't want him at the baby shower (I guess it's not really a baby shower as we're not asking for anything, but still) or the birth. \n\nHe thought I was kidding at first, but once he realized I serious got really upset and started an argument over it. WIBTA if I didn't let him attend the baby shower or birth?",

Not wanting your husband to attend a baby shower and/or the birth of his own child because he is excited about having a son, which you interpret years-later as him having been insufficiently excited (for your personal taste) about having a daughter is, honestly, one of the most mind-numbingly dumb and asshole-ish things I've ever read in this sub.\n\nNot only are you the asshole, you're the asshole a thousand times over.",

Just talk about recognizing girls can like football, baseball etc. too and bits can like dolls, music and shopping. \nPreferences are natural for a million reasons. It\u2019s ok! YTA from excluding him from these things. \nIf you are worried about gender roles and exclusions, just talk about it -frequently. Now and as the kids grow up. This can help ensure both kids have the same opportunities and access to experiences. After all, a penis or lack of penis does not automatically determine interests, style and talents. \nLet him be happy. Let your daughter be happy. There is much to celebrate!",

Maybe this has been a lifelong dream of his, to have a son.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: I'm not saying you should praise him for doing the bare minimum of showing up and being supportive, but he *is* showing up, and if you can't appreciate that, then at the very least, don't punish him for it. \n\nNow obviously the hope is that he does not play favorites, but until the kids get to that age, you're not going to know if he will do that or not.\n\nIf you ban him from his own child's birth, YTA\n\nAlso: If I've learned anything from the amount of couple's therapy I've gone through with my own wife, it's that any kind of withholding techniques used as punishment toward a partner (i.e. not talking, withholding affection, not allowing into space, etc.) only *ever* makes your partner resent you that much more.\n\nIs that really how you want your son's life to start?\n\nEdit to add: PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMENTING:Since so many people mistakenly seem to think I am saying this woman should be \"over the moon\" or \"falling at his feet\" for doing what they are calling the \"bare minimum\", allow me to clarify what I meant when I offered the perspective above:\n\nAppreciation goes a long way, and sets the tone for a better relationship. When my wife shows appreciation for even the most basic things, it actually makes me feel good and therefore more motivated to do bigger and better things, and vice versa when I show my appreciation for her.\n\nThe lack of appreciation, or taking things for granted, sows the seeds for resentment and has quite the opposite effect. If even the little things aren't appreciated why should I bother to try and do more?\n\nAny marriage counselor or couple that has been married a long time can tell you this. The little things really do matter.\n\nOP's concerns are totally valid, but her reaction is not. Rather than jump straight to punishing a man who is present and trying, (for something he hasn't done yet)  OP needs to TALK with her husband and tell him how his reaction made her feel, listen to his perspective and try and work this out via mutual respect and appreciation for one another through deeper communication. A counselor would be an excellent support for that endeavor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Stop taking your supportive husband for granted and talk to him about your concerns/feelings before you push him away and invalidate HIS feelings without listening to them.",

Never once did the commenter say \"he does the bare minimum and a lot of women don't even get that so be happy\". You guys are literally writing your own story because you want to shit on men in general. How about stick to the topic at hand and leave the toxicity elsewhere... Far far away.\n\nJesus christ reddit. What a piss poor attitude.\n\n(Ready for the downvotes btw and don't care)",

My dad loves us all very much, I have zero doubt of that. He's a great dad, and he's very willing to learn about things he didn't realize were biases he had, or just didn't know about. I was 9 when my brother was born. My parents usually didn't find out the sex beforehand, but because my mom was over 35 she had to have more scans and I think the tech had accidentally told her or it had been very, uhhhhh, apparent on the ultrasound. Anyway she had found out so she asked my dad if he wanted to know, and one of my sisters and I were in the kitchen (the other was a baby). And when she said it was a boy, much like OP's husband, he was SO obviously extra excited that it was like...really hurtful, even though it wasn't meant to be. I still remember it very clearly, and so does my sister, who would have been six or seven. My parents *weren't* trying for a boy, even though people will still say that when they find out our birth order (I'm like...pretty sure my brother was an oops baby, honestly), and I had never felt like my dad was upset that we were all girls or wanted a boy more than he wanted us, and looking back on it I don't, but after hearing that...yeah, I questioned it. And in some ways he did favor our brother. Not a lot, but my brother--who became a vegetarian at the age of five after watching Finding Nemo and never wavered-- was the only one my dad invited on fishing trips and things like that (he went, and threw any fish he caught back, because he was a very easygoing kid and hated conflict of any kind, until he became a teenager and started arguing with everyone for sport). It definitely did have an impact on my sisters and me, though, even though my dad certainly doesn't hate women and definitely didn't intend it to hurt us. I think being excited doesn't absolve OP's husband of thinking about how his actions would impact others, even though I also think OP is overreacting.",
