  "post content": "Here are the reasons why I feel I might need to skip my sister's wedding ceremony.\n\nI had surgery in February for gastric sleeve and now have new guidelines to keep my body healthy. One of them is to drink water regularly to avoid dehydration especially if I'm outside in the heat. This is the main reason why I might need to skip out on part of my sister's wedding.\n\nThe ceremony will be outside in mid-afternoon near the end of July. Humidity in her state is high and the summers are blistering. At first, I figured I'll just bring a water bottle with me and sip on that so no problem, however, I went on a walk yesterday high 80's outside with clear skies. I was ten minutes into my walk when I started seeing lights and feeling light-headed. I drank some water and it helped enough so I could get home but I nearly blacked out before I made it inside. This scared me. If drinking water out on a relatively hot day where there is little humidity could cause such a reaction I'm not sure if I could handle sitting under a hot, wetter heat for my sister's wedding.\n\nI don't want to cause a scene at her ceremony if I faint or have to leave in the middle of it due to the heat. So if it's really as hot as it should be on her wedding day WIBTAS if I didn't attend the ceremony? I also want to clarify that I intend to let my sister know in advance and this is her second wedding, not her first.\n\n\\*\\*I also want to make it clear that I go on walks often, usually early morning or late evening so I'm not out during the hottest periods of the day but on the day I nearly passed out I was out earlier in the afternoon which will be the around the time the wedding ceremony is scheduled.\n\n\\*\\*Lastly there will be nothing shading the guests during the ceremony. It's out in the open on grassland with no trees nearby.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- Thanks for the insight. I got some good points of view and thoughts on possible ways to not be an a\\*\\*hole in this situation. I'm gonna talk to my sister and hope some of your recommendations work out. ",
