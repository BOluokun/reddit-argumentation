  "post content": "This will likely get removed, but I\u2019m genuinely conflicted so I\u2019ll give it a shot! My ex-husband (43m) & I (46f) share 2 kids (18m) & (17m) & separated back when they were 3 & 2. We have a child support order in place, but I never held him to as much as the state recommended because I honestly just wanted to be done, & instead signed an agreement for about half of what the calculation was. He only started regularly paying in these last 5yrs through bi-weekly direct deposit (not a formal garnishment just a payroll disbursement), & even made an adjustment because the accountant at his job pointed out 2 extra pay periods a year. Regardless of how much he owed, I\u2019ve always kept my mouth shut because it was just \u201ceasier\u201d to accept whatever he was willing to pay. \nObviously, my 2 boys are hitting major milestones with cars, braces, college, etc., & I\u2019ve tried to bring this up only to be promised support that hasn\u2019t come. All the while he has reaped child tax credit benefits (for 1) & no expense when it comes to any visitation since he moved out of state. He sees them, but I still pay half or more of the expense. \nMy oldest is wrapping up his 1st semester of college & I\u2019ve paid the entirety. I\u2019m now paying deposits for the next semester & looking towards fees for the other. Same son also recently had to replace his car due to extensive parking lot damage, which I paid for in full. I\u2019ve let my ex know of all of these expenses & have asked for support but he goes silent or makes jokes (?) about how much anything that comes up must \u201csuck\u201d. \nI can\u2019t cover everything on my own anymore. My oldest\u2019s tuition for Spring is coming up & I\u2019ll soon have 2 kids as the other is graduating in a few months. I\u2019m all but broke. I bring it up & he laughs everything off as a joke because I \u201cmake more\u201d than him - even laughed when I said my mom was going to pay for oldest\u2019s dental. I ask for help & am reminded this (his support $) is what I agreed to. \nI finally put my foot down & said if he\u2019s not going to put these boys over his BS with us, then I will argue the agreement that I\u2019ve admittedly not held him responsible to.  He obviously thinks I\u2019m an AH for this. I honestly don\u2019t care what he thinks, but really, AITA for asking & expecting him to finally help??",

TA for wanting him to pay, but you are for letting him get away with this for so long. It\u2019s bad enough that you signed half away right from the get go, but you then didn\u2019t force him to even pay what you both agreed to on a regular basis, and in full. So he has never really stepped up in anyway until recently and now you think he will? \n\nThere is massive back support he owes and should be required to pay in full even if they are of age. But he won\u2019t if you don\u2019t go through the courts. Get a lawyer and take him back to court! \n\nESH.",

Hopefully they\u2019ll understand. Also, depending on where you are located, the back pay may not come in a big lump sum, but trickle in a bit each month. Think about setting up two separate accounts for each of them to split those payments into. Cause they may not be able to use them for college/university payments right away, but could use them for books, food, rent help and/or incidentals or even fun money while at school.
