  "post content": "My wife (35F) and I (35M) have been together for 10 years, married 5. We grew up completely different. She's the only child of a surgeon father. Her mother died when she was 2 and it was her and her father for most of her life. He remarried when she was 17. He's wealthy, sent her to private school, paid for her college, and when we met a decade ago he was still paying her rent, even though she had a solid job. I come from a poor family. But we both have pretty good jobs and make around the same amount of money now.\n\nShe is such a daddy's girl and it's been affecting our relationship. Anytime she wants or needs something, she goes to her dad first. And sometimes it's about things I could help with. I work in tech and back when we started dating she was starting grad school and she asked her dad \"what laptop should I get\"  I told her I actually work in the field (which she already knew) and could easily answer that and get her what she needs and she just kind of shrugged. Okay fine. These little things have happened throughout the last decade. But, there have been bigger issues recently.\nLast year, she decided she needs a new car. I disagreed. Her car is fine and she works from home and barely drives. She was adamant, though. About a month later, she tells me she's getting a new car. I told her we need to make these decisions together and we share finances and this is a major purchase. She says, \"oh, my dad is buying it. He said we can just sell mine and get some extra money.\" I told her it's kind of ridiculous to ask her dad to buy her a brand new car when she has a perfectly good one and we don't need it anyways. She got upset and said it's not that big of a deal and her dad doesn't mind and that the car \"wasn't that expensive anyways.\" She said I'm overreacting and that it's okay for her dad to do nice things for her. She got a brand new 2022 car completely paid for by her dad. And we sold her old one. \nNow, we are buying a new house. We've finally narrowed it down to two options. We were discussing it last week and my wife says \"oh I don't think house A is good my dad said he think we could do a lot better in our budget.\" Before she talked to her dad, she LOVED House A. So, I got a bit frustrated and said it didn't matter what her dad thought because this is our family's home and he won't be living there. She got angry. We started arguing. We both said mean things. I called her a spoiled brat and said she needed to grow up and she got upset and slept in the guest room and has it's been a few days and we have barely spoken. She said I was \"so mean\" to her.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: wow did not expect this to get so much traction. This was mostly a late night stream of consciousness and I realize I left a lot out, of course. I DID apologize to my wife for the name calling and we both agreed we have some issues to work through. Here's some more info for context and to answer some questions I've seen asked: \n\n1. We could have afforded the car on our own. We do well for ourselves. I was not worried about not being able to afford it. I just did not understand the rationale of buying a brand new car when you have a perfectly good one. Her old car wasn't even that old. It was a 2019 and had pretty much all of the same features her new one has. It didn't make sense to me. Also, we have a toddler and it's actually harder for her to get him in the new car than the old one. She also barely drives. I mean, seriously, the car sits in the garage 90% of the time. She has even said before that she hates driving. Sure it was free but I guess it's more about the principle than the car itself. But, she got what she wanted so whatever. \n\n2. We've been together 10 years - has it always been this  way? Why did I stay? --- valid points. And something I could dig deeper on. No answer right now other than I just fell in love and didn't want to leave. \n\n3. Do I have my own daddy issues? No, not really. My dad and I are fine. My parents are still married. We were very poor growing up and my parents were undocumented, and that was a very stressful way to live but my family made it work. I live on the other side of the country now so I don't see them as much but we talk and visit regularly. \n\n4. My father in law is a nice enough guy and for what it's worth, he also says his daughter is spoiled and has made comments throughout the years about it. Obviously I didn't need to call her a spoiled brat and I recognize the difference in her dad saying it and me but I am not the first person to say it to her. I KNOW THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT. \n\n5. I recognize I have my own issues due to poverty, trauma and all of that. I have been to individual therapy. That is a forever ongoing process. \n\n6. The house: All of the reasons my wife gave me are just matters of personal preference, like \"my dad says we need a bigger kitchen,\" \"my dad says we need a bigger backyard.\" He is also convinced we will have more children even though we said we so not want anymore so he also said we need \"more rooms for more kids.\" Nothing about safety of the house, the price, etc..just things he personally doesn't like or would have different in his home. Also we've been looking for over a year and he has given his thoughts many many times throughout the year. So, I'm not saying she shouldn't ask him for advice. Also, no, he would not be paying for any of the house. \n\n7. My wife has never been to any type of counseling in her life. When I suggested grief counseling for her after I started my own she looked at me like I said something ridiculous. Her family is very skeptical about therapy. So, I'm not sure if I will get her to do marriage counseling but we will talk about this further. \n\n8. Finally, my wife is a funny, creative, and beautiful woman. She's a great mom. She makes everyone laugh. I do love her despite what the post may make some of you believe.\n\nThanks to those who sent me thoughtful messages. They provided interesting perspectives. ALSO THIS NOT A FULL PICTURE OF EVERYTHING. I'M JUST NOT WILLING TO SPEND ANYMORE TIME WRITING IT. IT'S A LOT.",

It doesn't sound like she's lazy or entitled. Her dad had the money to send her to a private school and college! That's amazing. She got a great education and has a good job.

I can see feeling hurt if OP works in the field and she didn't even ask his advice, instead going to her presumably elderly father who also presumably knows less about current laptops than someone who works in the industry.\n\nThe house thing is a big question mark. *Advice* is great.   One can probably assume that FIL has bought a couple of houses in his time and has a few tips. As first-time homebuyers several years ago, my partner and I were happy to have the advice of our parents in terms of things to watch out for, red flags, and desirable traits, as well as advice on lawyers and inspections. They were overbearing at times, but when we found a home we loved, even if it wasn't the one they would have chosen for us, they helped us instead of trying to talk us out of it.\n\nThe question is whether OP is interpreting FIL's good advice as interference, or whether the interference is actually happening.

She said she needs a car, and he said she doesn't. Where is the discussion there? If both are making good money I don't even understand what the problem is, but it seems she realized he wouldn't budge on the budget and she wanted a car, so she told her dad and basically she got a new car without spending anything. Why is that a problem? If the father had said he would loan them the money or something, but nope, he paid for the difference for the new car.\n\nThen they get to this house and she seems to like it, talks to her dad and he says they can do better. He didn't say the house is bad, he said they could do better, basically financial advice. It seems she respects her rich dad financial advice, what a shocker!  OP could have had a mature discussion with her, but instead he told her he doesn't care what her father thinks because he won't be living there. How is that mature? I don't know, but if I am making a big purchase i would actually appreciate advice from people that cares about me. Her father clearly cares about her. So instead of getting all mad he could have a discussion as to why he says that and together they could decide if they buy or not. But instead he called her a brat. I say he is the brat.\n\nUsually when people come here complaining about mommy's boys they are complaining about guys that basically insert their mom in every discussion and egg them against their wife's. She didn't do that. She told her father about a major life decision and she took the advice. She didn't call the dad to tell her husband he is an idiot for buying that house. He doesn't respect her because she relies on him, like she is not mature enough. And to me he is the one with issues. If you have a rich parent that likes to spoil you even though you make good money yourself, why wouldn't you let them? How is that financially sound? The father doesn't seem to have strings attached to the things he does for her, so what is the problem? I mean it be could OP forgot to mention all the times the father really but in, but it doesn't seem likely. For me the laptop \"issue\" says everything.",

So while our parents help us out a lot now, we have the perspective of being young children who had very little and never saw their dad because he was always working. His ex girlfriend was always poor and resented him for getting nice stuff or financial help, he didn\u2019t blame her, but it ruined their relationship because she basically told him she didn\u2019t want to be with a spoiled brat. Uhhh, the entire reason my brother graduated college debt free is because my parents dedicated their entire life savings/work to paying for our higher education. I fully understand the frustration of thinking someone has had something handed to them their entire lives, but for us we hadn\u2019t even grown up wealthy, my parents had just lived in poverty in order to prioritize our higher education (neither of them went to college and their one goal in life was to see their children graduate debt free with a college education).\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not trying to be like \u201cpoor people don\u2019t know how hard it is to be privileged!\u201d but also, it\u2019s really hard not to get defensive when people project their insecurities onto you just because of your family. I recognize I was privileged to graduate college at all, especially debt free, but for some reason people hear that and assume I must be living off my parents money and always got what I wanted/needed. Money was a manipulation tool in my house, too. A lot of people forget financial abuse is extremely common in wealthy households. Just because someone\u2019s parents are rich does NOT mean they had an easy, comfortable, or well-provided-for life. I know people literally on the brink of homelessness while their parents live in multi-million dollar homes. They can\u2019t qualify for financial aid at school because their parents make too much money, but their parents don\u2019t give them a penny towards tuition, rent, etc. \n\nI really wish we\u2019d stop assuming rich kids are automatically well taken care of and better equipped for real life.

Seriously we listened to it all. Sometimes too much. But then we regrouped and discussed it just the two of us and made decisions together. I see none of that in this post happening.\n\nThe car situation is a little murky.

If that convo had been more along the lines of... You're right, this doesn't make sense financially, however, my Dad is totally cool with buying it, maybe the convo goes differently. Sounds like instead, they talked over the practicality, he thought they came to a decision, she came back and made the choice anyways. I could be wrong, but I can see why that feels powerless and frustrating, even if the end result was fine.\n\nThese two people just flat out aren't on the same page, and this wife possibly does value her father's input in life decisions more than her husband, and I think that's a problem. The computer scenario is obviously a nothing burger, but if this is a pattern of behavior, I again can understand why a husband would feel a little slighted to not be the resource she went to first.\n\nEnd of the day, I'm just gonna say NTA. But there's not enough context for me to fully form my opinion. The house one, though, to me is extremely frustrating. Because it sounds like OP is not having his voice heard on the largest family decision they've made to date, because of a convo with her father that he wasn't a part of.",
