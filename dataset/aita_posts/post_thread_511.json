  "post content": "I am starting to feel bad about this incident and I want reddit to tell me if I am the a-hole or not.\n\nSo today I was walking my dog and I was zoned out. I was listening to my podcast, I had a song stuck in my head, and I was also talking to myself. I had a lot going on in my head. The only other things I was really paying attention to besides what was going on in my head was my dog and if people were walking in my direction so I could make sure we could get out of the way. This is how I am most walks btw, I am zoned out doing my own thing with no real intentions of listening to strangers when I am out and about.\n\nSo we are walking, minding our own business when this lady (who is ahead of me) says something to me, I take my headphone out, but I didn't really process what she said. I assumed she just said hi because I think I have seen her before, so I moved into the street and kept walking like I usually do. Suddenly her dog is up next to my dog and she's yelling at me.\n\nIt is important to note that she had a little cast thing on her right arm that was pinning her arm to her body, so she only had one functioning arm to control this dog. (He was like a medium sized dog, maybe a husky mix?\"\n\nShe said \"Why couldn't you have just done what I asked and stopped walking?\" I apologized out of utter confusion because I honestly was not paying attention to what she was saying. And then she told me to keep walking so I did.\n\nIt didn't occur to me until after I had already walked away that she had asked me to stop walking so that she could get into her house with her dog. Now in the moment I don't feel like I was the AH because if you can't control your dog, you obviously shouldn't be walking your dog. Maybe she didn't have anybody else who could take her dog out, but you shouldn't rely on strangers to stop what they are doing to comply with what you want them to do.\n\nNow that I have calmed down a bit, I feel like I am kind of the AH. Maybe I should have been paying more attention to what she was saying to me? Maybe I should have asked her to repeat herself, and I feel kind of bad now that the moment is over.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for continuing to walk when someone told me not to?\n\nIn compliance with dog tax, here is my dog- [https://imgur.com/a/VtDESih](https://imgur.com/a/VtDESih)\n\nEdit: I am going to try and be more aware of my surroundings from now on. Just to make it clear I wasn't on autopilot walking blindly, I was paying attention to things ahead of me and I was watching my dog. From now on though, I will make it a point to keep my volume down so I can pay more attention around me just in case something like this happens again. Thanks for all the judgement's and feedback. ",
