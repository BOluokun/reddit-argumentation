  "post content": "Would we be the a-hole for naming our baby the same name as their cousins? So my husband and I are expecting our first child and we found out it\u2019s a boy. Ever since we were dating we had talked about having kids and naming our first son after my husband (William and calling him Liam since it was different than my husband\u2019s nickname and the only one we really liked) who was named after his father and his grandfather (all three are William but my husband has a different middle name because his parents didn\u2019t want him to be the III).\n\n In the last year and a half two of my husbands sisters had boys and the first was given William as a middle name. It kind of rubbed us wrong but we brushed it off because no one really remembers a baby\u2019s middle name after the first few months anyway. Then a few months later his other sister had her son and his first name was in fact also William with the nickname Liam. Also note that neither sister asked my husband how he felt first. We were pretty upset for a long while but at the time all my husband said to his sister was a joking \u201chey that\u2019s my name lol\u201d because we both didn\u2019t know how to react. \n\nNow both nephews have just past their first birthday. And we were hoping our baby would be a girl so we didn\u2019t have to cross this bridge quite yet, but here we are. We\u2019re having a hard time still letting go the idea of having our son named after my husband and his family line and no other names we\u2019ve looked at are really something we want to settle with. \n\nSo we\u2019re thinking of still going with our original plan since it is in fact my husbands name. It feels like the name is cheapened a bit but we still really like it for our son and our nephew Liam and his family live across the country so we\u2019re thinking it really shouldn\u2019t matter except for holidays when we\u2019re all gathered and we don\u2019t mind using Big Liam and Little Liam to distinguish the two. But we\u2019re still afraid the family will cause us drama for the decision. \n\nWe don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s petty at all to use the name anyway especially with our every day circles being entirely different and the other nephew that\u2019s local it being his middle name. Just wanted to get opinions if that would generally be considered an a-hole move or us or if it would be completely normal for us to do?",

So if you have a son, and grandpa's name is John, all the first born of that generation are named John, even if the fathers of these boys are brothers and thus their kids have the same first and last names. (The daughers at lease offer a different last name.)\n\nOn another note, my daughter wanted to name her daughter Grace but, nope, her husband's brother's daughter (thus her cousin) was named Grace.  So she named her something else.  My daughter's child has met the first Grace once in 15 YEARS.",
