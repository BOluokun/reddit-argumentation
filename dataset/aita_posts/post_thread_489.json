  "post content": "Hi Reddit, \n\nLong time lurker first time poster and obligatory mobile formatting.\n\nI (f17) have hated my name my whole life. It\u2019s an extremely common name and I feel as though I don\u2019t identify with it, it just doesn\u2019t feel like my name. Sure, when someone says my name, I answer, but when introducing myself and saying my name, it just feels wrong. \n\nI\u2019ve wanted to change my name my whole life, there have been three names that I\u2019ve wanted to change to when I was younger, but haven\u2019t thought about the name change for a while.\n\nWhere I am to change your name you must give your birth certificate and be over 18 (without parental signature). Now my parents for my life havent been very good parents, sure they pay for my education and food, but after that they weren\u2019t very kind to me and have been very unsupportive all round, they have also been quite mean and just without going into it weren\u2019t the best parents. Another reason I want to change my name is that I don\u2019t want to identify with the name they chose for me, because of how they have treated me.\n\nWhen I was around 12 I brought up the idea of changing my name (not legally or permanently at all just an idea) and they were very against it.\n\nSo I\u2019m thinking when I turn 18 I change my name, but if I ask them and they refuse to give me my birth certificate this could be a hard battle.\n\nMy idea is when I turn 18 I go and legally change my name, and I honestly probably won\u2019t tell them, or if I do it will be after I have moved out, I can live with having them call me my birth name, at least temporarily so long as I can live with everyone else calling me my chosen name.\n\n\nHere\u2019s where I believe I may be the a hole, I\u2019d be taking my birth certificate without their knowledge and changing my legal name without their knowledge, after all I am still their daughter and still technically \u201ctheirs\u201d to name. I feel as though it may not be my right to change my name and that may be the a hole move \n\n\nI\u2019d be happy to answer any questions if this wasn\u2019t clear enough!\n\nTLDR: WIBTA if I changed my name without my parents knowledge or consent as a legal adult",

If 18 is the legal age where you are from - then you should be given your birth certificate if you ask for it. \n\nYou can also look up county records and find out how to obtain a copy. You probably have to have some type of ID. Minimally you can find out what you need to obtain a copy. People do lose them - so that\u2019s not an unusual request. You may want to research some laws regarding this in the state in which you live. \n\nIf you feel your guardian (or parent) will not give it too you then take it if you can. Do you have a secure place to store it? If not, make a copy for yourself. As a full-fledged legal adult you have a right to have it. They do not own you. \n\nOnce you have what you need - change your name. Do not ask permission - they will guilt you , say no, and make a multitude of excuses. The bottom line is - it\u2019s your choice!\n\nGood Luck!",
