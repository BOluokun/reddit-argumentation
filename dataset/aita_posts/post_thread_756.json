  "post content": "I spend a large amount of time in a wheelchair. I can walk but stresses my body and leads to pain.\n\nFriends and myself like to go out drinking on the weekends. Clubs, pubs etc. Friends suggest to go to new popular club, I'll say sure. Roll up there and find that it has step or stairs. It's gotten to the point where I'm saying to them that I'll only agree to clubs that are easily accessible to me. If people suggest a place I told them that if it's not accessible then they have to figure out a way for me to get in. This has caused massive friction with the guys and girls I'm going out with. I get it, the nicer/cooler/whatever places give them a better chance of hooking up. I really do want to experience some of those places myself but there's a barrier of entry.\n\nMost of the time nobody wants to carry my chair into a club and bouncers often don't want to touch me because of liability reasons. So we go somewhere else, these are mostly places that are empty of with people but not our other extended friends. I can tell my friends are getting frustrated with me and often I get told the places I choose suck. This is true, most of the places I choose are shitholes, but shitholes I can enter and drink in.\n\nOh you say, why not call ahead to find out. Well, I try that and most places believe they accessible but forget to mention only entry/exit is steps/stairs and no disabled restrooms. Basically I'm getting false information out of ignorance rather than meanness. It's happened where I've gone to a place rolled in the entry area, paid cover charge and then been confronted with stairs/steps so I can't even buy a drink and chill in a foyer.\n\nI know it's entitled of me, but when we all go out drinking, I take the approach of we all have to be able to enter and have fun or no one does.",

If they then end up regularly going without you, they are probably shitty friends.",
