  "post content": "3 days after endgame came out and I was finally ready to go see it, a randomly placed comment on Facebook spoiled the ending to me. I was a bit upset, but not so much that it ruined the movie for me.\n\nI remembered who had done it, and I've come to find out they're a massive game of thrones fan. So I did the only sensible thing by looking up spoilers (thank you freefolk) and messaging him some questions about an item he was selling, while peppering in spoilers for tonight's finale.\n\nHe's pissed. I told him sucks to suck pretty much. \u00a0\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nFriends think I was an asshole, but honestly I think it was pretty deserved. The dude spoiled endgame in public comments so I was likely not the only one spoiled, but I direct messaged him GOT spoilers so there weren't any others who saw it. AITA\n\nEdit: in case it changes how you feel about it, the comment I stumbled upon was not on anything at all related to the avengers / marvel, and it wasn't conversation about the movie but rather \"XXXXX Dies.\"\n\n**EDIT 2, ELECTRIC BOOGALOO**\n\nThe general concensus seems to be ESH, and I'll accept it. I'm not sorry, I'd do it again to be honest.\n\nA soul for a soul",
