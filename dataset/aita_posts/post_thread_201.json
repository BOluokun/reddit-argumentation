  "post content": "so me (47M) and my wife (46F) have four kids (9F, 11F, 13M, 17M), and one of them is a trans guy (17M). my wife hasn't been the most supportive, we are working on it and I am fully on my son's side. (ik she is TA for this but this isn't what my question is about)\n\ntoday my son came down wearing boxers and a hoodie, my wife started to complain about how it's inappropriate to walk around like that, saying that it's too revealing. she told him to put some pyjamas on.\n\na few minutes my son came down in a pair of pink pyjama shorts my wife brought for him. she turns to him and tells him that he looks much better now. he laughs and tells her 'that's weird, these shorts are a good five centimetres shorter than my boxers' and had a huge smirk on his face.\n\nmy wife started complaining about his attitude and turned to me to get me to say something, I just told her that he's right. she's now pissed at me for not being a united front for our kids and encouraging that kind of disrespectful behaviour. so AITA?\n\nEDIT: just wanted to add that this is the first time my wife has taken issue with this, it's not uncommon for my daughters to lounge about in underwear and t-shirts. (also for those asking, there is no slit or hole in his boxers)",
