  "post content": "I love her, we\u2019re not about to split up (sorry Reddit!) but I am annoyed about this and think it\u2019s her fault, she thinks it\u2019s mine.\n\nMy GF usually wears trainers throughout the day.  Her feet get hot and sweaty and when she comes home she takes off her shoes and socks and leaves them wherever they fall. \n\nI\u2019m not that tidy myself and don\u2019t really mind the shoes but sweaty socks everywhere is not very nice.  I find them all over the place. I keep asking her to put them in the laundry basket and she will that time and then forget the next time.  So I ask her and she rolls her eyes and moves them. \n\nToday, I was speed vacuuming prior to my mum coming over and a sock under the chair sucked into the hose, which I definitely did not need.  Getting it out covered me and the floor in dust.  I was annoyed and had what she called a temper tantrum and threw the now dusty sock at my gf who happened to be painting her nails. She knocked her nail polish over and it spilt on the table.  Great!\n\nLuckily she reacted fairly quick and cleaned it up before there was too much damage, though there is a stain.  Her manicure was a mess as well.\n\nThen my mum arrived.  We tried to bury it while we had company, not sure if Mum noticed. \n\nHad a big row when she left and are blaming each other.  Hopefully we\u2019ll be ok tomorrow but in the meantime AITA?",

Simply take a broom and sweep them into a pile. With gloves on, bag them and put them out in the garage or somewhere. When she runs out of socks, she'll have to go get the bag and deal with it. Just be sure you don't leave your stuff out to annoy her! LOL",
