  "post content": "I (18f) live with my dad, his wife Hannah, Hannah\u2019s daughter Grace (20f), and our younger brother (8m). Grace really only comes to stay on the weekends since she\u2019s in college, and this time she brought her boyfriend Issac (21m) with her.\n\nI\u2019m biracial, my dad is white and my mom is black. Honestly I don\u2019t look anything like my dad so most people don\u2019t even think I am mixed. We like to joke that I got his personality instead of his looks.\n\nPeople tend to say offhanded stuff to me about how I don\u2019t look the way they think I\u2019m \u201csupposed to\u201d. I\u2019m kind of used to it especially since my dad ended up married to a woman that is also white so like every time I\u2019m with them it obviously looks like I\u2019m the odd one out. I\u2019m not afraid to correct people, but sometimes that gets exhausting and I\u2019ll just play dumb instead.\n\nGrace and I had planned to get lunch together and her bf Issac ended up coming along with us. She wants him and I to get to know each other better since she really likes him, so I figured that\u2019s why she brought him.\nWhile we were having lunch, my mom\u2019s side of the family was brought up, and then Issac said that it must\u2019ve been a shock to my dad at least for me to end up so dark since most mixed kids are lighter in complexion than I am. But then he said that at least I ended up with \u201cgood hair\u201d so I didn\u2019t lose out completely.\n\nGrace didn\u2019t speak up and say anything to him about it, so I pretended not to understand what he meant and asked what was so good about my hair and what it was he thought I was losing out on anyway.\nHe got flustered and said \u201cwell you know\u2026most girls with your skintone have curlier hair.\u201d\nSo then I asked why he thought my hair was good just because it wasn\u2019t that curly. He said he felt it just looked nicer. So I asked why he thought that textured hair didn\u2019t look just as nice. He kept blubbering out excuses and digging the hole even deeper for himself, and finally Grace told me to cut it out and leave him alone.\n\nI paid for my part of lunch and left after that. I didn\u2019t tell my dad or Hannah what happened, but it\u2019s obvious enough that Grace is mad at me. My dad asked that she and I solve whatever the problem is, because he hates seeing us be so tense around each other.\n\nGrace ended up telling me that she was pissed because I made her boyfriend look like a jerk by playing dumb. I told her that I didn\u2019t have to make him look like a jerk because he already was one, but she said that I drew the problem out more than necessary and made it worse than it needed to be when I could\u2019ve just told him that he f\u2019ed up.\n\nI mean I could have done that, but I don\u2019t think it should be my job to, and plus I feel like it was probably more effective to get him to explain his logic outloud rather than have me tell him he was being a jerk.\n\nGrace is insisting that I should have just told him point blank, and bc I didn\u2019t, she thinks I\u2019m an AH.\n\nEdit:\n\nMy dad just texted me to ask if something happened at lunch with Grace\u2019s bf so I\u2019m pretty sure when him and my stepmom get home later, I\u2019m going to tell him what happened since it seems like he already knows something did.\n\nAlso, I do wanna say that my reluctance about telling my dad and Hannah isn\u2019t because I want to protect Issac or anything, it\u2019s because Grace is my step sister and I care about her. I know she really likes this guy and I really only feel bad bc even though I know I didn\u2019t really ruin anything for her, it feels like I did. The situation just sucks I guess.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI ended up telling my dad and Hannah what happened when they got home, and they both told me that I did absolutely nothing wrong. Hannah said that she would talk to Grace about it, and my dad basically said that Issac was no longer welcome anywhere near our house.\n\nDad also gave me a mini motivational speech where he reiterated that I look perfect just the way I am and that colorist/texturist/racist bigots have no place in our family or our home.\n\nGrace drove back to campus a while ago so I guess Hannah is gonna call her later to talk with her about what happened.",

So i can empathize with having to deal with very frequent micro (and sometimes macro) aggressions. Playing dumb is often the most effective way to get people to comprehend their own prejudice.\n\nGrace is angry because she has to either admit she is willing to accept that her boyfriend has these beliefs (unfortunately common for people to think this way), she and her boyfriend may both need to work on their own beliefs, or maybe end things (? Probably not unless this was a tip of the iceberg comment).\n\nAnyways!!! Good for you. NTA.",
