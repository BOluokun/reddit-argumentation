  "post content": "My husband, unbeknownst to me, bought a motorcycle from his best friend at work. It's a sturdy, old Honda from the early aughts in near-mint condition.\n\nI'm horrified. My mother is a nurse and raised us to believe, \"We have a term in the ER for motorcyclists, we call them organ donors.\" Made my brother and I promise to never to ride on or get one. \n\nWe have a beautiful 6 month old baby at home, our first. \n\nInitially, I demanded he return it, but he said it was his \"life long dream\" to own a bike & kept saying how great it would be on gas. \ud83c\udfcd\ufe0f\n\nEDIT: *yes he knew my views on bikes before we got married & everytime he brought it up I asked him not to do it*\n\n*I knew he was interested in bikes, but none of this \"life long dream\" stuff*\n\nSo I said, ok, keep it, but don't drive it over 30 MPH & don't take it out of our neighborhood. (We have a lot of side roads).\n\nEDIT: *of course, it goes w/o saying he would have to have \"safety gear,\" a decent helmet, & pass the course required to obtain your license. In our state, helmets are mandatory* \n\n I said he can also  take it up to the lake where he and his friend go fishing, if he promises he won't drive it over 30 mph and stays off the highway, IOW, tows it up there on a trailer behind our car. \n\nEDIT: *what I mean here is don't take it on roads where the speed limit is over 30mph or out on the highway. The roads in our neighborhood & around the lake have a posted 25 MPH speed limit.*\n\n*the whole point of the \"riding rules,\" which admittedly aren't great, is I'm trying to find a  reasonable compromise b/c he is insistent on keeping it. I mean, I'm nursing this baby and changing her diapers all day and I can't stand thinking about this anymore*\n\n\nHe says I'm being a controlling harpy and sucking all the fun out of his new toy. \n\n\nAll I can see is him splat all over the asphalt and our daughter asking me \"Why is my Daddy in Heaven?\" one day.\n\nAITA for trying to establish motorcycle \"rules?\"\n\n\nLAST EDIT: *we cannot afford \"extra\" life insurance, especially since husband just suddenly spent 6k on new bike. his life insurance is through his work, and it's just the average policy*",

Get him leathers and a good helmet and have a talk about why he did this behind your back so close to the birth of your baby.

                      "content": "I recall once reading that most bike accidents take place closer to home and at lower speeds. I will say that the way bikes maneuver make it more difficult to react at lower speeds. You don't really turn at higher speeds - leaning and adjusting your weight along with slight manipulation of the handlebars will do the trick as the effects of your movements are amplified with speed and your body will tend to maintain balance in turns due to centrifugal force. At lower speeds, you have to do a lot more turning of the front wheel to maneuver - treating your bike more like you would a car - and it's a lot easier to lose control. The more you have to turn your wheel at low speeds, the more likely you are to become unstable, especially as you'll have greater difficulty naturally maintaining balance without the benefit of speed. Think about the most awkward speeds to maneuver a pedal bike: You see a lot more people falling down when they're going slow than when they're at full clip. Now tack several hundred extra pounds of dead weight onto that pedal bike and imagine just how much more difficult it would be. \n\nAll that said, it really depends on the type of road you're going to ride on. I take residential roads to get out of my neighborhood, but would never use them as my primary place to ride for the same reasons you've listed. Plus, they just aren't a lot of fun. Going slow in full riding gear means you're usually going to be hot, whereas a good vented jacket will cool you down at speed. But, I hate riding on interstates, especially those with dense traffic. Rush hour sucks on a bike and you really never want to have to stop quick on a bike at any speed - too much front brake and you can go over the top, too much back brake and you can step out, and a mismatch between brake pressure can cause drift or wobble. I want to be able to focus on my ride and I know I always need to be planning an exit from every vehicle in my vicinity. As such, I tend to like to ride on back roads where there's not a ton of traffic and I have a lot of visibility.",
