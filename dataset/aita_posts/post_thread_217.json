  "post content": "I'm getting married and my fianc\u00e9 and I don't want to serve alcohol at our wedding. We've got no deeper motivation for it beyond the fact that neither of us like dealing with drunk people and we don't trust our respective families enough to restrict themselves. \n\nWe really just care about our ceremony but we are also having a reception, and we're going to be sending out invitations soon. This alcohol clause is really bothering people, and I've had multiple friends and cousins (and some older relatives) tell me that I would be an a-hole for not \"considering their wants\" at my wedding. I understand considering their needs (like I'm not inviting my friend with a wheelchair to a wedding on top of a bunch of stairs) but I think that wants is a bit excessive. We're not charging them anything to attend or requesting a gift; my husband and I are paying for the wedding entirely ourselves and have invited people under the impression that they'll just decline if something is really bothering them so much. \n\nI don't know if I'm being excessive, though. The people we're really close to (our parents, siblings, and dear friends) are all coming regardless of the alcohol, so this is just an issue for relatives we're not as fond of and honestly wouldn't mind if they come to our wedding or not. But I think that calling me an a-hole is a bit extreme, and I'd rather they just outright reject instead of making suggestions that we don't really want to take. I understand that weddings can just be a hassle for some people, and the alcohol's the only thing making it worthwhile; fine, then, stay at home and have some alcohol. But I feel like I'm missing something. Is there some sort of social code I'm not seeing?",

Congratulations!\n\nETA:  OP said her motivation for not having alcohol is that people on both sides of the family will not restrain themselves.  Not how they want their wedding.  Isn't the point of a wedding to have people witness a joyous ceremony, a milestone in your life?  Some are commenting like the point of the wedding is to have a big party for everyone else to enjoy.  It is the bride's and groom's day, right?  The bride and groom will remember this day for the rest of their lives.",

It\u2019s no secret many people see weddings as an opportunity to party and have fun. And yes, for many this involves alcohol. The way I see it is, you\u2019re throwing a party for your marriage. Now if I\u2019m hosting a party, I think about what my guests would want and within reason, I provide that. I guess it comes down to this\u2014does it matter to you and your husband about what people think of your wedding? Is it important that they leave saying \u201cwow that was so much fun!\u201d Or does that not make a difference? If it really doesn\u2019t make a difference, do it your way! But if it\u2019s going to bother you to potentially not get the best reactions, I might try to find some sort of middle ground.",
