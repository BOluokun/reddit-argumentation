  "post content": "My (26F) sister Anna (24F) married my friend Lance (27M), he was the cool guy in our friend group, handsome, misterious, smart, quiet. I don't know how he ended up with my sister, she's the total opposite, loud, funny, outgoing. She's beautiful tho, really beautiful, and when they got together everyone said how good they looked.\n\nAnna seemed to be really in love with him ALL THE TIME, she used to say how dreamy he was, how good he treated her and how spoiled she felt, but Lance was always so stern and quiet, she would revolve around him at family gatherings but he wouldn't engage that much with everyone but me and her. I was surprised when he asked her to marry him.My sister never took the wifey role too serious, she had a non-traditional wedding and Lance when along with it, she made a bunch of rules that he agreed to and then they moved to his house. Anna banned house utensils from the wedding gift list, she doesn't work, didn't finish her studies and they don't plan on having kids.\n\nMy sister is pretty much only into her looks (And I didn't think Lance cared for that before), she's always on Snapchat or Instagram, I thought that after getting married she would dress more appropriate since she used to use crop tops, blouses, dresses and shirts that showed her cleavage, short skirts or tight jean, but she says that Lance likes her just fine.\n\nLast week was my dad's birthday and we had a party, my sister and Lance came and she was wearing a pretty short floral dress, nonetheless most of the men were looking at her including my dad's friends, Lance was as stoic as always and my sister came to my mom and I and saying that she didn't know why he was so quiet since he's not like that (HE is like that wtf) so I told her that if she didn't dressed like that he might take her more seriously.\n\nShe got sad and sat quietly the rest of the night and I didn't think much of that, but a few days ago Lance texted me and said that he would appreciate if I didn't comment on her wife's way of dressing again. ??? Did I miss something?\n\nIM NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM",

And your jealousy is nasty and misogynist.\n\nThis is why I'm SO glad Lance himself put her in his place. He's perfectly able to air any concerns he has with his actual wife - no need for OP to read into his actions or take it upon herself to lambast his wife on his behalf. She's not his guard dog.   \n\n\nUgh it's PAINFUL when friends or family get posessive like this. Like, no matter how long you know someone,you don't necessarily know them better than their life partner. FFS",

A relationship involves a different intensity of finding out what someone is like, and often a different level of intimacy from many friendships.  \n\n\nI have friends I've known for like 20 years, some of them have been very honest/close friendships, but I would never presume to say that I know them better than their partner, even if their partner has known them for a much shorter time.
