  "post content": "I am disabled, but I still try to work a minimum of 15 hours a week. Lately I have been working a ton more as a substitute to make up some of our savings back after both our cars decided to freak out. I won't explain the details of my disabilities as to not identify myself, but they are physical and mental in nature. \n\nMy disability matters in this context because my husband has an FMLA claim with his work to stay home with me when my disabilities are too much for just me to deal with, and to drive me to my doctor's appointments. He had to use all of his sick days from his job before it dipped into his vacation and now we aren't being paid when he takes time off. \n\nSo now we get into what happened this morning.\nHe wakes up 3 hours before I have to get up for work and he has 3 alarms every morning, because he sucks at waking up. After the last alarm he lays down for 5 or so more minutes, and I get a little pissed and ask him if he is getting up or not. He tells me he isn't feeling good, and he is nauseous...\n\n\nSo I get a little more mad since once a week he has done this for 4 weeks. We are broke. I have had to work way more than I am capable of without fucking up everything and he is nauseous 4 weeks in a row? I told him we can't afford for him to be sick right now.\n\n\nI am normally only capable of 15 hours per week, and some weeks that is stretching it. He refuses to let me sign up for disability because, \"We don't need it\" and it could affect our ability to adopt/foster in the future. So to make up for the weird shit that popped up in our lives I have scheduled myself to work my ass off for 4 weeks, and he can't even go to work regularly? He makes about double what I do as well. \n\nHe got very mad at me, and just turned our bedroom light on and stared at me in the doorway for like 5 minutes while I was attempting to go back to bed. I kept asking him what he wanted the whole time, because I had to get up in 3 hours. No he just stared at me, then after 5 mins said I was being a real bitch, told me I shouldn't stay out past 8 anymore since he wakes up so early and can't sleep when I am not here, and that we need to buy better food. \n\n\nLike what the fuck. Of course I am pissy. I am tired. This is not what FMLA is for. I hang out with my mom once a damned week until 10ish. And OH MY GOD WITH WHAT MONEY? \n\n\nI am exhausted. I can no longer go back to sleep, he claims he didn't know I worked today so it's okay to do all of that. I'm so tired. I don't get it. I go to work sick all the time, because I am literally never not sick. 4 weeks in a row.\n\n\nNow he's sleeping in the bed next to me after I cried from exhaustion and frustration. I am just so done. I can't even tell if it is my crazy ass that is making me take this out of proportion, or if I am allowed to be mad. He has said sorry, but like I can't stop being mad and sad. I just keep crying and he is passed out.",

I...don't understand this...\n\n>I told him we can't afford for him to be sick right now.\n\nHe could use his sick days if he hadn't already used them for you...?\n\nLike, I get it, you're 'more sick' and have disabilities, I have some idea of that myself, but I don't see any sympathy from you for the fact that your husband is also apparently sick here. Sure, he may not be suffering quite like you are, but it's not a competition. His sickness can still be bad for him.\n\nESH, I guess. You don't seem very caring towards him and the sacrifices he makes for you, and he should agree to you signing on for disability if you're disabled enough to qualify and get the assistance you clearly need.",

I find it fucking ridiculous that they do that anyway, but it's not something I can change. I deleted it to fit in the word count, but he has used his vacation time, and he has none left. We make sure to have him schedule it every January so he gets breaks, but this last year he did a month long vacation in February. That was awesome, and great, but it is the end of the year and I think he is having burnout and having issues dealing with our financial burden. I for sure need to apologize, and we probably won't do a huge vacation for him next year to help prevent this. \n\nI am still talking with him about the disability thing, as my doctors keep telling me I really need to be on it. There are days it is so bad I can't move very well, and those are when I need him to stay home and help. I usually with meds and things can deal with it myself. I try my best to remain as independent as possible, but working and being able to dress yourself and things like that are two different levels of abilty. I have good days and bad days, but I try to put as little pressure on him as possible since I love him and want him to be happy despite him taking care of me as often as he has to.",
