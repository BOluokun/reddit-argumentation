  "post content": "New poster here. \n\nSome background: I (F31) been married for 3 years to husband (M37), we are a mixed race couple. Since before we got married SIL (F31) has been generally unpleasant - for example making snide comments about my job, which she finds v. dull, taking issue with me whenever she visits our home as I always request guests to take off their shoes, etc. Says it\u2019s imposing and I\u2019m treating people like they are dirty. Little things really but quite annoying as these comments keep on coming and we have to meet frequently - she is close to my husband, who dotes on her. I always just shrug off her remarks as feel like she\u2019s just baiting me for an argument and succumbing to that would pretty much lower me to her level. I\u2019ve overheard her telling my husband that she thinks I\u2019m fake cause I\u2019m always smiling. \n\n I recently gave birth via c-section. SIL visited shortly after my baby\u2019s birth, took one look at her, then asked if I was sure if she was my husband\u2019s since she looked \u201ctoo chocolatey\u201d , and maybe the real dad was black or brown (husband is white). SIL said this before all the other fam members from my husband\u2019s side gathering around the baby. Husband laughed, everyone else fell silent, then she went on and on while she and husband bantered about daughter\u2019s possible dad. I didn\u2019t know what to say, just sort of stared at her in a shocked haze.\n\nAfter everyone left, I told my husband he was an idiot to not realise SIL was insulting both him and me and she was being racist and I didn\u2019t want to see her again - especially not while I was recovering from a hole in my belly and couldn\u2019t even sit up without hurting. I cried and it physically hurt to cry. Husband says she was just joking and I am overreacting by a mile, that I don\u2019t know her like he does and if I was so upset, why didn\u2019t I say anything. I told my family, they were v pissed.\n\nThis felt like the last straw so I banned SIL from our house and from seeing our little girl indefinitely. Husband v. reluctantly delivered the news - I told him it was either that or I\u2019d go stay with my sister with our baby. SIL reacted by crying and saying she didn\u2019t mean to be racist or offensive but since I don\u2019t believe her, I\u2019ve just ignored her. Husband is v. unhappy with me, says I forced him and won\u2019t give SIL the opportunity to apologise, for something she didn\u2019t even know she was doing wrong etc. but I really don\u2019t want to see her. MIL also unhappy, said SIL has the right to see her niece, and being tired has made me unreasonable. Still standing my ground on this, but AITA?",

Was never told exactly what but I can guess. \n\nMy parents didn't visit them again for four years and my grandparents were expected to shape the hell up before their first grandchild (me) could have a relationship with them. \n\nAnd they did. They changed.  They loved me and my brother unconditionally and spoiled us like grandparents do.  And they loved my mother too because they *knew she never needed to forgive them for their awful behavior but my mom did anyway*.  Grandmother realized what she did was wrong and appreciated that my mother did not go no contact for the rest of time, and that she was *lucky* to know me and my brother.\n\nI say all this to say to OP--this was my dad respecting my mom when she encountered racism from his own family.  He acknowledged it, and stood beside her when they had to protect my mom from ugly vitriol from his own mother.  And no, no one on either side of the family had the \"right\" to be in my or my brother's life if they were being awful people, let alone racist. \n\nIf your husband cannot see that this is toxic and disrespectful to you, this marriage is unsustainable unless you think going crazy over time hearing all this stuff is worth it for love.  In my book, it ain't. \n\nP.s. god forbid what the hell is this SIL going to say to your kid when they're old enough to take it in?
