  "post content": "My daughter (28f) is marrying a woman (28f) and my husband and I have been trying to be as involved as we can be without violating our conscience or who we are and what we believe. Ever since our daughter opened up to us about her relationship, we've been staying open-minded, praying, communicating with her about it, asking questions, researching, welcoming the girlfriend into our home and getting to know her, attending online therapy with a LGBT counselor that our daughter paid for, and just overall trying to be a loving presence in our daughter's life. It's a process and my husband and I have come a long way from where we were, but sometimes we still come across these, what our therapist calls, \"blocks of resistance\" that hold us back from supporting our daughter in the way that she may want us to, in that moment.\n\nAnd what I really appreciate about this counselor is that she takes our situation into account as well and is willing to speak up for my husband and I. A few years ago, when our daughter wanted us to attend a gay parade with her, we were hesitant and our counselor stood by us by telling our daughter that it was \"too soon\".\n\nBut other than the gay parade, things have been pretty smooth up until now. My husband has drawn a hard line about attending the wedding. I was sort of on the fence about attending, but I decided to stick with my husband. Our daughter is pissed. At our last therapy session together, a week ago, our daughter said that if we didnt come to the wedding, all the work and progress that we had made would mean nothing to her, and that she would not want us to be a part of her life.\n\nAgain the counselor spoke up for us and told our daughter that everyone had their hard boundaries (boundaries that they would absolutely not cross) and that instead of making ultimatums, it would be better to consider the overall picture rather than letting one moment be the deciding factor of the relationship. [I'm paraphrasing, she said it much better, but I think I got the main point].\n\nThe counselor talked to me privately afterward and told me how her parents hadn't came to her wedding, and they eventually made up thirty years down the line, but that was thirty years of memories that they both had missed out on. Yet, when she talked to her parents about it recently, they said that even as much as it had hurt them not to go, they would have made the same choice because it was just something that they strongly disapproved of. She ended by telling me that she wasn't going to tell me to go or not to go, but to really consider all the pros and cons.",

My Mom had a hard time and while it was rough for a 15 year old kid, after reading this, I want to call and tell her how much I love her and how proud of her I am.\n\nYou see, you don't get credit for trying to \"be a loving presence\" in your child's life. That should be a given. As hard of a time as my Mom may have had SHE took it upon herself to do the work. She knew it was HER issue. I didn't pay for her to go to therapy (a therapist who BTW seems to be coddling you). Your daughter hasn't done anything wrong. She's just being. It's on YOU to come to terms with the fact that antiquated beliefs are causing you to struggle with loving your kid for who they are and adjust those views. If you can't, you need to remove yourself from her life because every single time you don't accept WHO SHE IS you cause her pain. \n\nMy Mom went from \"Marriage is between a man and a woman\" to standing up as best person at a gay wedding (not my own). You can get there. You're just looking for any excuse not to. Own that if you won't change it and stop trying to get kudos for doing the bare minimum and balking when asked to do anything more.\n\nYou can not go to her wedding. In fact you shouldn't if you can't be supportive. However, know that this is probably where your relationship with her ends at least in any meaningful way. You won't get a second chance.

It's a show about an African American family, where mom is a doctor, dad is a stay at home dad, then there is doc and she has a little brother, they get an adopted sibling later in the show.\n\nThe main character is a little girl, Doc,  who is a toy doctor. She heals toys with all types of problems that also include situations that kids can face irl. Like one episode the toys get \"the glitters\" which is similar to having lice and its explained how to prevent it, but also not to exclude the person who gave you lice.\n\n Another episode there was a sort of earthquake in the toy village and doc needs to reunite the doll family. Which is a family with 2 moms who are also different colors. And the awesome part is it's not mentioned as something special. They are just the doll family and they need to be reunited after the earthquake. \n\nOne of my other favorite characters is a male action figure. He is super badass, goes on all these adventures, and he's in a wheelchair. There is more but it's just a really awesome, wholesome and inclusive show. \n\nI hope this helps.",

If you do, than this is how you show it. \n\nThe middle ground exists in the not joining the parade, or not putting a pride flag on your house.  It is not \"I love my daughter, but it's weird and gross, and against my beliefs, so she gets a pass in theory, not in public.  I'll continue rejecting other Lesbians politely, and that's fine.  I won't change my church, habits, thoughts, actions that shows my constant rejection of who my daughter is, but that's ok because 'faith'.\".  \n\n\nUltimately you will have to choose if you accept this or not.   That is your choice to make.  Do you actually accept her, or not?  That is where she's expecting therapy to lead to.  That is the point of this.
