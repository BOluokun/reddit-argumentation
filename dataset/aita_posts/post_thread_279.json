  "post content": "My daughter just turned 6. We had a birthday party for her on Saturday. That morning was pretty hectic. I was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and I didn't notice.\n\nAll that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as \"Sarah\" and it's \"Sara\" and I said, \"who cares, just scrape off the H\" but she insisted on returning it. So I said \"fine whatever.\" And then as she's leaving she says since I screwed up already I should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. \n\nAnd I go into the kitchen and I ask my daughter, \"what's the most important thing?\" She says \"the gift bags.\" I found all the candy and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.\n\nMy wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive. The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says \"dont worry, dad made them\" and she looked so relieved until I got the box. She looked inside an was horrified\n\n\"What the fuck is this?\" she whispers. And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. I then I just take over \"goodbye\" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.\n\nWell halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me \"those are dog poop bags\" and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.\n\nwell, reddit, they dont look like \"dog poop\" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? I tell her \"It's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags\" and damn it she freaked. She says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.\n\nSo yeah I've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. I told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said I was a huge asshole and she's mad that I dont think it's a big deal. and I still dont. Actually, I think I'm the one that should be mad at HER for keeping this going for almost a week.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I used dog poop bags as goody bags by accident for 6 year old daughter's bday party",

      "content": "YTA, not only for using poop bags but for being so disengaged with what's going on in your own home.\n\n1. They misspelled your daughter's name and you didn't notice or care. Birthdays are a BFD to a 6-year old.\n\n2. You asked your daughter what was the most important thing. This is her birthday, and you put the onus on her to tell you what to do. Why do you have to be told what to do at every step? Have you never been to one of your kid's friends' birthday parties? Think for yourself what has to be done!\n\n3. You describe your contribution as \"the attempt I made at helping.\" Definitely makes it sound like it was your wife and child's thing, and you were only there to help. You weren't part of it.\n\n4. The fact that you didn't realize that you put the gifts in poop bags implies that you didn't know they were poop bags. Which implies you never walk the dog or pick up its poop. Which implies your wife does that too.\n\nSo it sounds like she does everything around the house and for the family, and you're just a part-time disengaged participant. My guess is that if you were planning the birthday party alongside her, and taking care of all the little problems along the way, she wouldn't have minded if using poop bags for the party bags was your way of working around the situation where you forgot to buy party bags. In fact, she might have laughed at your creativity. But it sounds like everything is always on her and you only do things if you're directly told.\n\nIf you didn't want to be an actual part of a family, you shouldn't have started one.\n\nEdit: So after 10 years on this site, this is far and away my most upvoted (and I assume downvoted) comment ever. There were a lot of responses, more negative than positive, so rather than reply individually, I'll explain a bit more here.\n\nFirst off, there were a lot of comments calling me a cunt, bitch, or worst of all, a Karen. One person said they could tell my gender just from my post. Someone else said that I have no idea what it's like to be a father. Well, I hate to break it to you guys, but I'm a dude. A father dude with 2 teenage daughters.\n\nI think one reason for the harshness of my reply is that I was just like OP when my kids were younger. In fact, I'm probably more like OP now than I care to admit, but I'm trying to be better. I was the sole breadwinner for the family, so I had a sense of entitlement that my wife should handle all the domestic stuff. To some extent, that was fair. I was at work, and she was at home raising the kids. It's something we agreed upon since I had better earning potential and we wanted our kids raised by an actual parent instead of a nanny. But I took that entitlement too far. I disengaged from the household stuff to a point where I missed out on being part of my family. Being a partner on the household stuff can be a pain to be sure, but it's part of being a family. I think my tone was intended to grab OP by the shoulders and shout, \"Pull your head out of your ass! You're missing out!\"\n\nThe idea of just \"helping\" with stuff like this reminds me a lot of when people say that fathers who are home alone with the kids are \"babysitting\". No, they're parenting. If you're just helping your wife execute this party, it's the equivalent of babysitting rather than parenting.\n\nOne last clarification on point #2, since that was the point that a lot of people who otherwise agreed with me disagreed with. It's really hard for a 6-year old to know what the most important thing is. All she knows is that she wants a party. She should not be setting priorities like a client or project manager. If you were running up against time constraints, you could say something like, \"Honey, we were hoping to do all of this stuff for your party, but you know what? We ran out of time! I still need to make party bags, put up streamers, and hang up balloons. I'll try to get them all done, but if I can't, which one of those things is most important to you?\"\n\nOP, I'm sure your wife doesn't expect you to be perfect. Mistakes happen. But you seriously give off a vibe of just doing what you're being told and not being an active participant.",

His wife chose her solution, which left him with every element of preparation now to do alone, because she was no longer there.

But the actual mental effort of running a house and a family, they leave to their wives (usually while their wife has a full time job and looks after the kid mainly - and I don't know if it is the case here if she has a job of not) \n\nDo they organise the house? What planning of the party did they actually do? Did they just do like they were told and \"helped out\" like a child - or did they put actual decision making and preparation into the party without being asked or told what to like an adult? \n\nThis is a really common problem. And I imagine this isn't the first time this dude has left his wife to organise everything - hence the overaction.\nPotentially, she's got two kids, one of them she didn't ask for, and she's fed up.\n\nEdit: example - my ex used to bang on about how modern he is because he helped me clean the house. But every time, without fail, we'd be cleaning and he'd repeatedly come up to me and ask me what to clean. Dude - just look at the house. What do you *think* needs cleaning? This is just one example of this kinda stuff, and partially the reason I'm not with him any more.",

Some of them are very cliquey and mean and it could really make a difference in how the daughter is treated at school by the other kids. Failure to live up to a mean mom\u2019s standards could mean no invitations to parties, no play dates, which could make school a pretty tough place for her kid. Those pariah kids become easy to pick on because outcast moms can\u2019t get the bullies in trouble for bad behavior.",

For some reason we are pressured to make the party look fun, have the best gift bags, with the best cake, at the best location. If she is a SAHM then there is added pressure since her job is literally to take care of the household.\n\nFrom the way it sounds she also may be a type A person who likes to take charge. Chances are she has planned and tried to execute the whole thing and got overwhelmed by it. And if they live in an affluent area there is even more pressure.\n\nMy son goes to school where the good majority are *very* affluent, and the mom culture can be very cliquey and toxic. One small, bad move can put you in mom jail for a very long time. If the cake isnt good enough, or the theme is off brand, the party favors aren't top of the line, even if the food is store bought, catered, or home made. Is the party at a venue, park, or at the house? What kind of house is it, or how much did the venue cost? Was the house neat as can be or was there dust side pannels? This shit is seriously like the mom Olympics. \n\nI think dude is NTA, and mom is heavily overreacting, but it's because the culture is so toxic and can send a woman into social purgatory. They need some counseling to learn how to communicate better, and it sounds like she needs a therapist to deal with the stress she has on her plate.",

And it's very positive, because it's saying, let's work as a team on protecting our brand, rather than just pointing out individual things. Like, I'm not in a long-term relationship, but I'm writing this in my diary as a LPT to keep for the future.  \n\nEDIT: this blew up overnight but let me clarify - I\u2019m not saying some stranger or barely friend would get to make me feel bad about my relationship. If my boyfriend was being a flaky dumbass, I\u2019d have noticed already and I\u2019d be bringing it up regardless. If I was being a socially awkward ADHD person, which I am, I\u2019d expect him to bring it up rather than letting Karen down the street snicker behind her hand at me. That\u2019s the point of both of us watching our public image or whatever - I don\u2019t have enough mental energy to do it for us both and I have anxiety anyway, so it\u2019s about making sure we\u2019re working as a team.   Also, for me at least, this is highly hypothetical - I haven\u2019t even been in the same room as a guy I\u2019d like to date in three years, mostly because my last relationship was with a narcissist who liked to make me look crazy in public. So yeah, I think the idea of actively not embarrassing each other is sweet.",
