  "post content": "I (27m) have been living with my girlfriend (29f) for several months now. For the most part things are really good and I plan to propose soon and hopefully have at least a couple of kids with her.\n\nHowever we've run up against a conflict.\n\nShe's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast. She likes a huge breakfast in the morning. She usually has eggs, either French toast or pancakes, hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes, and sausage or bacon. Sometimes on weekends it's ham or steak. She eats almost nothing for lunch and usually has a smallish dinner but she loves a huge breakfast.\n\nMeanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning.\n\nHowever my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her \"no\" but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her.\n\nShe seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return. But I think that since she makes a huge breakfast for herself every morning anyway that throwing an extra portion of whatever she's making on for me would take next-to no effort on her part, so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?",

You even get happier outcomes if instead of trying to be too literal about 50% of everything you divide things by the tasks people prefer. If one person hates cleaning the bathroom and the other hates doing laundry, you'll both be happier dividing according to the tasks you don't mind and appreciating that your partner does the thing you hate. \n\nIn this case, what's broken is they have a 50-50 split for a communal meal and OP's gf is probably already not to thrilled about being on her own every breakfast, but OP went from \"not around so it's not in the division of labor\" to \"hey how about you do 100% of this thing.\"",

When each person truly cares for the other, each shouldn't mind doing something extra once in awhile because it will, at some point, be returned. Or should be.

It's ebb and flow, give and take. It's never going to be 50/50 all the time, forever. People need to be flexible. For example, I have a chronic illness. When I feel good, I love to cook and cook dinner most of the time. When I'm not feeling well, my husband cooks. It might just be hot dogs or spaghetti, but he gladly does it. I love to cook, so I don't mind doing the majority of it most of the time. He and my son clean up after dinner. To me, that's a fair split, even though it takes more time to cook.

I'm always surprised in these things that people don't seem to realize that doubling the food you make in a large breakfast adds both time and dishes. Eggs, bacon, pancakes, and hash browns are typically all made in frying pan/skillet. It's pretty easy to do two eggs and 2-3 strips of bacon in a single pan at the same time, but not four eggs and 4-6 strips of bacon. Likewise, pancakes and hash browns for one, you can likely fit in a pan at the same time, but if you're doubling the food, it's going to be much harder, especially with the pancakes. You end up having to either use twice as many pans or you have to do twice as much time so that you can cook everything in sequence.\n\nThat said, it seems like there was a pretty obvious compromise that hasn't been mentioned, which is that OP does all of the breakfast dishes.

Some sources used to claim (and some still do, I'm sure) that this was because a lot of our \"repair processes\" happen during we sleep (which is true), and obviously the body does less of all of that as we age, so less repair = less sleep. More recent research, though, shows that's not really true: older people *need* as much sleep (if not slightly more, because the repair and regeneration that *does* happen can take longer and be more resource-intensive), but often have a harder time *getting* it. They wake up more often, sleep less deeply, and wake earlier in the morning. \n\nI\u2019ve seen conflicting research as to why many older people *feel* like they need less sleep, even when they (in the studies I\u2019ve seen) objectively benefit from more than they normally get. One suggested the \u201cthings\u201d that tells us when we need sleep and make us sleepy may function less effectively as we age.",

So if you take dinner, that means you have to budget, plan it out, buy the groceries, and then cook and clean up. Maybe if you're lucky, some days she will do the dishes because she loves you.

Maybe I want to sleep in occasionally. Maybe I'm tired of always being the one to put the kids on the bus in the morning. It doesn't always feel fair. But I make it work because I understand that my husband's job doesn't always have the most reasonable scheduling and the brief times when his schedule lines is better with mine and the kids, he has no problems helping out in the mornings so it's not an unwillingness on his part to share the labor, just scheduling. Our compromise is that if I have to handle all the morning routines, he is handling all the night routines. If I'm waking them up, picking clothes, packing lunches, finding homework, and waiting in the cold for the bus at the crack of dawn, then he is making sure they get washed, get into jammies, brush their teeth, find their missing stuffed animal they haven't mentioned in days, reading bedtime stories, and making sure they actually stay in bed. \n\nIf I'm in charge of starting the day, he is in charge of finishing it.",

I usually have a meal shake for breakfast, but if I were inclined to cook up a mess of eggs, I\u2019d be more than happy to cook more for others, especially if they were known to not be as perky in the morning.  (I\u2019ll even start a pot of coffee for the house when I don\u2019t drink coffee.). So if my significant other needed my help to prepare more breakfast to help him out, I cannot imagine not just agreeing to doing it.  Unless there was something about the request that made me feel like I was being taken advantage of.  Then I\u2019d have to wonder, why am I still in this relationship?  If I were having these feelings, I sure as heck would not be remotely considering making a commitment and making babies with this guy.  Years ago, I dated a sociopathic narcissist.  (Learned what one of those were based on my experience with him.).  I had to have surgery during our time together.  He called from work to check on me and to see if I needed anything.  At the time, I had run out of dog food for my dog.  I didn\u2019t want to ask, but I was still on bed rest.  I asked if he could stop at the pet store after work for me.  I would pay him back.  He hesitated then complained that he was too busy at work and asked me why I couldn\u2019t just do it for myself.  The phone call ended soon after.  I immediately regretted even asking.  At that point, I had to strategize how to get myself up and put together enough to run an errand.  Doubled up, I made my way out of the bedroom.  I remember to this day looking at my dog and telling him, \u201cif I\u2019m stupid enough to marry him and get pregnant with his kids, I swear you\u2019re going to have to drive me to the hospital.\u201d That\u2019s when I allowed myself to admit I was dating a very selfish person and it would only get worse from here.  I was able to extract myself from the relationship safely and never looked back.  Not saying OP is a narcissist but you are right that something is going on for the GF to be counting chores.  OP needs to get a better reading of how GF sees their relationship and how well things are going.",
