  "post content": "I was telling my friends at a nye party about how I got a new job in Seattle doing finance and supply chain management for amazon. It\u2019s a big deal for me because my current job sucks (procurement for State government)\n\nAlice then goes off and tells me that working for Amazon is pointless that I should have a greater purpose than shipping people boxes of stuff they don\u2019t need. She then talks about how in her life that serving the country was her best decision and she was happy sacrificing pay to do meaningful work.\n\nNow if it was one on one I wouldn\u2019t care but she said this in front of a lot of my friends. So I told her that her job in the air force was guard duty in Texas and data entry. That she didn\u2019t serve the country anymore than I currently do in my state job.\n\nIt seemed like I flipped a switch she started cursing me out, saying she could have been called to Iraq. That I have no idea the training she had to do how tough it\u2019s for women. Then saying I am ungrateful for the troops? I don\u2019t think I was an asshole in this at all and I do respect the Troops but the ones that actually see combat not ones that are basically in government jobs.",
