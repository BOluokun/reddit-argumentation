  "post content": "My family and I grew up very poor. From when I was old enough to legally work, I (19F) have had to take on multiple jobs while balancing school to help with my family and my younger sister. Growing up, I never had a lot and whatever money I earned I would spend on my sister (16F) and family. When I was 18 and had just been accepted into college, my dad's business that he'd worked on for the past couple of years finally took off. This also meant that my sister could now have a normal high school experience without worrying about money.\n\nWhile I was in college, I wasn't in contact with my sister that much since I was so busy with schoolwork. However, from our calls and her social media, I could tell she had changed completely and was involved with some bad people. She would post videos on her snapchat of her getting drunk, smoking weed, juuling, driving while most likely drunk/high, etc. I tried reaching out to her, but she would mostly deny the claims and told me to mind my own business. At some point, she justified her actions using the argument, \"This is what the cool kids do now, not everyone was a nerd like you in high school.\" One of my high school friends who also has a brother in the same grade reach out to me and said that she heard that my sister was seeing a sketchy guy from another school. Apparently he sells drugs and was expelled from my sister's high school. I asked my sister about this and she denied it.\u00a0\n\nLast week I got a phone call from my mom who was sobbing. She tells me that my sister is pregnant. I was so shocked that I could not speak. Then I was angry. When I was her age and even younger, I gave her everything and so did my parents so she could have all the opportunities her peers had. Since my dad's business became lucrative, they've given her every opportunity to succeed (any extracurricular/sport she wants, academic tutoring, school activities, etc.). I never got any of those things. It angered me so much that she took all of this for granted and fucked up her life. The father? Her delinquent \"boyfriend\" who got expelled and sells drugs.\u00a0\n\nShe blows up my phone but I don't respond. She then sends me a series of long text messages asking if she can crash at my place. She also asked me if I could make her an appointment to see a doctor. Lastly, she asked if it would be okay if her boyfriend comes and stays over sometimes. I shut her down. I told her that you dug this hole for yourself. If you allowed yourself to become pregnant, then you should be able to deal with the consequences. Also, I\u2019m currently sharing a small apartment with two roommates! She begged some more and I denied her. In the past few days, she's still be texting me and calling me non-stop saying that she has nowhere to go and has been living in her boyfriend's car. I haven't responded to a single message of hers, but I feel my resolve wavering a bit. I fully don't support her, but maybe I'm being an asshole?\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I would still NEVER house her in my apartment. That would be extremely disrespectful towards my roommates and would get me kicked out due to the lease agreement. I meant I was considering giving in and sending her some money.\n\nEDIT 2: My parents have DISOWNED her, not kicked her out. They are refusing to acknowledge that she is their daughter, but she is still welcome to live in their house. She chose not to since my parents are absolutely fuming and probably will yell at her and criticize her, which she honestly needs.",

You say it all in your post: she had every advantage--first from YOUR hard work, then from your Dad's hard work.  And she CHOSE to fuck it up.   What's more, drugs are involved--and you never want to get involved with people who are druggies, let alone let them into your apartment.   They'll steal you blind.  This is her problem to solve, she can move back with your folks.    She has choices, she wont be on the street.  But even if she was on the street, not your problem.   If you're worried about the baby?  And she's still being irresponsible?  Then that's for CPS to deal with. \n\nThere are so many reasons for you to stand firm: \n\n1. She built this, she has to deal with it.\n2. She needs to learn that actions have consequences.   \n3. \"Helping her\" is not only enabling her bad behavior, it's also enabling drug use, with her AND her boyfriend.   Again, enabling = prolonging.   The BEST way you can help her is to cut her off. \n\nBut this doesn't count the most important reason of all.   YOU.   YOU have earned your decent life.  You've worked hard, you've helped your family, you've helped your wretched spoiled sister!    Now YOU get to live your life!   You get to put reasonable boundaries around your life -- and that's what this is, a reasonable boundary-- and not ruin your own life by being dragged into someone else's mire.    I know it's hard because you've spent so much of your life being so generous and so giving, but honestly OP, it's your turn to think of yourself and what YOU deserve.

Besides someone struggling with addiction stealing you blind, there's going to be an emotional toll on you by continuing to try to help them out. \n\nI watched a friend's family go through something similar when I was in college and it drained them not only financially at times but also emotionally going from hope that maybe this person is going to turn their life around, to devastation as that person took advantage of the family. Eventually they cut their family member out of their life after a couple of years and they said it was easier to accept that, even though it was painful, than to continue trying to \"help.\" Helping and offering support also burned bridges. The family member in question is still hanging out with the wrong crowd and has ended up in jail a couple of times, but even if they turned their life around the family has said that it would be difficult at this point to accept them again because of the damage done and the sense of being betrayed during the time they tried to prop their family member up. \n\nPoint is, if you offer help and your sister gets her act together then that would be awesome, but from the sound of it she isn't about to do that. Trying to help will put a burden on you and also your roommates. If your sister doesn't change it could cause possible legal trouble, will be an emotional drain, and if someday in the future she does try to get her act together and restore contact with her family, it will be that much more to work through and overlook on your part.",

I\u2019d also get her a bunch of condoms but don\u2019t trust her to use them by themselves.\n\nIf she\u2019s vehemently against abortion: I\u2019d still try 100% and try and get your parents to get her to go after baby is born for said contraception.

Very likely. \n\nShe needs HELP. And no, I don't mean help as in you taking her in and letting her continue her ways. Which you obviously aren't doing anyway, which is good. \n\nI mean even though your parents \"disowned\" her, I blame them too. You can't just throw money at a person and give them things you didn't have and expect them to just grow up normal because they had things. The fuck sense does that even make?? \n\nThink about this. You and your parents  both worked hard to have her grow up kinda spoiled. Then wonder why she grew the fuck up kinda spoiled..? \n\nI know I\"m just kinda venting here and I'm obviously sure you didn't tell the whole story, but because you didn't, my brain is trying to fill in the rest to make this story make some kind of sense.\n\nYour parents DISOWNED a SIXTEEN year old. Rather than go the extra step and try to get her SERIOUS help. And you can say \"SHE WON'T LET THEM!\" all you want. She's fucking SIXTEEN. She's still a child. Your parents can still take her to a therapist, or a psychiatrist. \n\nTL;DR: Tell your fucking parents to get her ***REAL*** help, instead of throwing her the fuck away.",
