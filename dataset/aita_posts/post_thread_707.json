  "post content": "I was at a comedy show and the comedian made a joke referencing a joke the previous comedian made, problem is that comedian didn't make that joke (apparently he does it all the time) so the audience was confused. \n\nSomeone then said the first comedian kind of sucked, it wasn't that loud so I couldn't tell if he was actually heckling or if he just accidentally spoke to loud but the comedian heard it and asked him \"would you like to come up here for 5 minutes\" and the guy responds with \"no I'm not funny\" then the comedian says \"then shut up, you can't determine what is and isn't funny then\" the crowd goes wild cheering him on\n\nI then say \"I don't need to be Gordon Ramsey to say a meal is shit, just like I don't need to be a mechanic to know there's a problem with my car if there's smoke coming out of the engine. You don't need to be funny to think a joke isn't funny\" \n\nThe comedian then just said \"security can you get these 2 out of here\" \n\nMy girlfriend is pissed saying I ruined the comedy show. I think that comedian was just kind of a dick.",
