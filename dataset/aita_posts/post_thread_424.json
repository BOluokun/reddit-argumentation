  "post content": "My fiance (25M) has braces. He refused to get them when he was a child/teen cause he feared people would make fun of him, but he finally accepted to get them after the dentists told him clearly that it wouldn't be recommended to replace his extracted teeth till he fixes his crooked ones. The issue is that our wedding was supposed to be coming up soon, but now I plan to postpone till my fiance gets rid f his braces. I have nothing against him wearing braces. I even encouraged him to get them to finally fix his bad teeth, but did you ever saw of a groom wearing braces at his wedding photos ? I don't think so.\n\nI thought my fiance would be understanding, but instead he got mad at me and accused me of being ashamed with him. That's obviously no true, I just want our wedding photos to be as esthetically pleasing as possible and that's why I want to postpone our wedding till his braces come off. I also told him he could've avoided all this if he got invisible braces, but he said these were much more expensive and wanted to save money specifically for our wedding and honey moon and didn't think his fiancee would be so shallow to care about it. He ended up saying that if I postpone the wedding now I might as well just call it off altogether, which I think is incredibly unfair of him to do, but maybe I should've insisted on this issue either.\n\nAITA ?",

He also already flagged he's self conscious so why would he choose to add non-urgent braces to his day when theres so much focus on the couples mouths (smiling, calls to kiss the bride etc)? I am DESPERATE to know his thought process! I am very, very invested in this AITA, this is so nuanced and personal to me.  \n\n\nAlso - why didn't they seemingly didn't talk about it beforehand of his steps in taking a reasonably big and pricey general life decision? Before I got my braces my fiance took me out for a 'last meal' of all the things that get banned (mostly corn on the cob and chicken wings!) - we planned it as soon as I found out my brace-face-date.
