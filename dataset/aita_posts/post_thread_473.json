  "post content": "I feel like a giant asshole for not being more compassionate to those with mental illnesses. Hear me out:\n\nI'm in my 20's, and have been going through a rough time with my health (severe fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue/chronic pain and other issues), went through a massive breakup, estranged from my family (they don't believe that I have a chronic illness). My second cousins have been very generous to let me stay with them for a few weeks, to get back on my feet again. I am super grateful for that.\n\nThey are older (70's), their daughter is in her late 40's. She lives at home, now I know why: I discovered (I stay in the room next to her) after a week or so that she actually has a severe mental illness and talks to herself *constantly.* She spends the majority of her time locked in the bathroom, whispering and cackling to herself in multiple different creepy voices.\n\nShe regularly screams at her parents. I overheard them talking, she was angry about me being there. Her mom confessed the mental illness to me and said it flared up. I've been polite and staying out of her way as much as possible. She avoids me, glares at me, and seems to hate me.\n\nI feel like an asshole...I've disrupted the family, am getting a huge favor, AND I am not compassionate. Her mother (who owns the home) welcomes me with open arms. I have almost no money, having spent it all on my medical bills and having supported my ex-boyfriend's career (mistake) before getting dumped. My health is horrible, I'm applying for disability soon, and I have a hard time walking due to the pain and issues I have.\n\nI know the 'right' thing to do would be to leave, since my presence is clearly exacerbating the illness, therefore putting stress on the whole family. But I'm desperate. My parents won't help me until I can get approved for disability, I have no money.\n\nBeggars can't be choosers, but my schizophrenic cousin is creeping me the *hell* out. I feel like I'm in a psychiatric hospital. There's the fear that being schizophrenic, she may hear some voice convincing her to do something to me. I'm on edge. I avoid her and lock my door.\n\nShe disturbs enough that living out of my car or finding an old friend/another family member is starting to sound appealing. But I'm just struggling to do much right now with energy and pain. I just need a place to plan my next move. I can stay here but I feel like a jerk for biting the hand that feeds me.\n\n**So: (TL;DR:)** Am I the asshole for not being able to stand my cousin's mental illness / holding judgemental views, fearing schizophrenia? Being chronically ill myself, I feel I should be more compassionate. I feel like an a\\*\\*hole for disliking her so much. But it's the truth. I feel bad for her poor parents for having to deal with her terrifying unstable mental issues and secretly wish she were institutionalized for everyone's sake. I guess physical and mental illnesses just suck for everyone involved.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI forgot to add, she has her own multi-bedroom house that her parents bought her a few minutes away, she is there sometimes but I guess she chooses to live with her parents, perhaps because she needs to. I am not sure exactly what the situation is, just that she is there part of the time and here part of the time.",

Hear me out:\n\nI'm in my 20's, and have been going through a rough time with my health (severe fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue/chronic pain and other issues), went through a massive breakup, estranged from my family (they don't believe that I have a chronic illness). My second cousins have been very generous to let me stay with them for a few weeks, to get back on my feet again. I am super grateful for that.\n\nThey are older (70's), their daughter is in her late 40's. She lives at home, now I know why: I discovered (I stay in the room next to her) after a week or so that she actually has a severe mental illness and talks to herself *constantly.* She spends the majority of her time locked in the bathroom, whispering and cackling to herself in multiple different creepy voices.\n\nShe regularly screams at her parents. I overheard them talking, she was angry about me being there. Her mom confessed the mental illness to me and said it flared up. I know she hates me. I've been polite and staying out of her way as much as possible. She avoids me, glares at me, and seems to hate me.\n\nI feel like an asshole...I've disrupted the family, AND I am not compassionate. Her mother (who owns the home) welcomes me with open arms. I have almost no money, having spent it all on my medical bills and having supported my ex-boyfriend's career (mistake) before getting dumped. My health is horrible, I'm applying for disability soon, and I have a hard time walking due to the pain and issues I have.\n\nI know the 'right' thing to do would be to leave, since I'm clearly disturbing her with my presence, therefore putting stress on the whole family. But I am desperate. My parents won't help me until I can get approved for disability, I have no money. \n\nBeggars can't be choosers, but my schizophrenic cousin is creeping me the *hell* out. I feel like I'm in a psychiatric hospital.There's the fear that being schizophrenic, she may hear some voice convincing her to do something to me. I'm on edge. I avoid her and lock my door. \n\nShe disturbs enough that living out of my car or finding an old friend/another family member is starting to sound appealing. But I'm just struggling to do much right now with energy and pain. I just need a place to plan my next move. I can stay here but I feel like a jerk for biting the hand that feeds me.\n\n**So: (TL;DR:)** Am I the asshole for not being able to stand my cousin's mental illness / holding judgemental views, fearing schizophrenia? Being chronically ill myself, I feel I should be more compassionate. I feel like an a\\*\\*hole for disliking her so much. But it's the truth. I feel bad for her poor parents for having to deal with her terrifying unstable mental issues and secretly wish she were institutionalized for everyone's sake. I guess physical and mental illnesses just suck for everyone involved.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
