  "post content": "I work as a purchasing administrator for a large automotive company. I work out of Kentucky, but I'm responsible for procuring parts for our plants in Tennessee and Missouri. Before finally getting an office job, I worked in our Kentucky plant for 7 years. The entirety of this time was spent on night shift. I was also attending college full time for 4 of those years until I earned my Bachelor's. It wasn't until July of last year that I finally got a dayshift office job.\n\nDuring this time I was still expected to be a husband and father. That was fine. I would mow the grass, take the trash out, and do other odds and ends around the house. I made time for my family and I made time for school.\n\nNow my wife works at the Kentucky plant. Not for the company, but as a contractor. She's outsourced labor. She expects me to clean every nook and cranny of the house while she's at work, cook for the kids, and wake up at 6 AM for my office job. All the while, she now blatantly refuses to get up and help because she's \"too tired from night shift\". Also, she blames me for not cleaning the house. She claims that I don't have a physically demanding job anymore and \"just sit on my ass all day.\" Thus, I should be able to take care of everything in the evening. Even going as far as to say she guarantees my job was never as hard as hers.\n\nI worked the same long hours all night long. I worked building cars; not doing the menial tasks that the outsourced workers do. I went to school.  I got promoted to a job that I was striving toward. I don't know if she resents me for not doing \"manly work\" now or what. She said \"It doesn't matter that you did it for seven years. You're not working nights now.\" I'm also worried of her negative reaction if I voiced these feelings. She wants to quit because of how much she hates it, but we could really use the money. AITA for pushing back on her desire to quit her job? AITA for not being empathetic toward her when she's talking about being \"too tired to do anything\"? I get it. Night shift sucks. I try to feel for her and relate to her in that regard. I don't think she wants that. She wants me to tell her to go ahead and quit, but I won't. AITA?",

However, this is all depends on your honesty here, mowing the lawns and taking out the trash probably isn't IMO a massive chunk of taking care of the house... \n\nShe probably took on it all mostly, did she? The grocery shopping, the cooking? The laundry? Vacuuming and mopping the house every week? Cleaning all the rooms, keeping the house tidy, on top of that the main childcare? \n\nI'm not saying you did nothing, it's just I'm maybe getting the vibes she held the house down and the childcare for 90% of the time you were doing nightshift and college full-time, which would have been exhausting, but my point is she probably did so much of the taking care of things when you were doing that, she might expect that in return from you now?",
