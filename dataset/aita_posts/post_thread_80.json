  "post content": "My daughter recently got her license, and I bought her a car that I remember she said looked nice. I told my ex, and my daughters mother, about it and she said I shouldn\u2019t have done it cause I didn\u2019t get her, \u201cconsent\u201d. \n\n\nFrom my perspective I don\u2019t need her, \u201cconsent\u201d. Since we\u2019re not together anymore. She claims that it\u2019s our daughter so all purchases like a car must be discussed and I was wrong for just buying her a car. She thinks I\u2019m trying to show my daughter\u2019s step-guy up or something. Since apparently she asked them and he couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\n\nI will admit that hearing about my daughter asking the other guy and them not being able to afford even a used one before I stepped in and bought her a new one is very satisfying. I hate that guy, so getting 1 over on him is always good. But I genuinely didn\u2019t know anything about that. And I really don\u2019t think how it will make his kids feel should matter to me. I hate him, his kids, and anything to do with him. So I\u2019m glad he\u2019s upset about it. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the A hole for not checking with my ex and her new husband.\n\n\nA persistent person asked me to include the fact that I pay for my daughters insurance in my main post. But that I do not plan on paying for the gas she used, or\u2026.\u201doil changes\u201d. Daughter has a job so she can pay for the gas she will be using. Also that I conceded custody.",

Here\u2019s the thing, my friends step sister was 2 years older, had a part time job and got really good grades. Used her own money to purchase driving school lessons, had her drivers license two years before they bought her the car. She paid for the registration and insurance, which wasn\u2019t too much considering it was an older cheap Honda. So when my friend turned 16, the very next day asked her mom and step dad to buy her a car. The obviously said no, because they just spent their saved money on a car for step sister, my friend didn\u2019t even have a license or a permit, didn\u2019t go to driving lessons because she refused to get a job and had really crappy grades because she refused to do homework and skipped school a lot. Her dad would just buy her whatever she wanted because dad had a lot of money, hated his ex wife and definitely hated the step dad|. So she called her dad up and told him about how step sister got a car but mom refused to buy her one because they spent all the money on step sisters car. Dad got pissed off, argued with the mom, and the next day took her out to buy a car. It was used, but they bought a Mercedes that was only a few years old. Dad enrolled her into driving lessons but she still drive the car with out a license. Months down the road her dad ended up moving across country with the mistress and cut contact with my friend. Mom wasn\u2019t able to afford to get the Mercedes registered since it\u2019s super expensive to get a car like that registered, nor could they afford insurance for a car like that. Mom tried making a deal with friend, they would try to get the car set up IF friend got a part time job to help with costs. She never did, and eventually got pulled over and caught with out a license so the car got towed. And there it stayed. \n\nAll this because dad didn\u2019t think he had to discuss buying a car with ex wife since she was the EX and was more than happy to \u201cone up\u201d step dad, then blamed ex wife and step dad was playing favorites with the step sister. \n\nAs for as I know, step sister went on to a really great university with a scholarship , married some guy, had a cute little family and both became doctors. and my \u201cfriend\u201d dropped out of high school, married her high school boyfriend the moment she became 18, had a few kids. Last I checked she was on her 5th kid with her 3rd husband and was excited because she finally got section 8.  I always thought it was so strange how it was like stereotypes wrote themselves with these two girls.",

He got handed a sports car, no payments. I had to work for my first car . Paid for by myself. We have different values. I wish my ex would have spoken to me first before promising her things like that. I hope to have another conversation on costs and responsibilities on the car. Because I am the primary parent who pays for nearly everything . \n\nMy ex should have talked to me before our daughter for sure",
