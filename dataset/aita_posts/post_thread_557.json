Some of which include fatigue, dizziness, irritability, things of that nature \n\nMax (21F) and I have been dating for a while and living together for almost a year now, and have gone through multiple other health things as a team. She\u2019s always been great when I\u2019ve had issues in the past and I\u2019ve tried to do the same for her. \n\nNow to get into the problems-for the past month or so, anytime I\u2019ve been feeling sickly or upset or gotten irritable for no reason (other than meds and cancer being generally hard to deal with) I\u2019ve tried to kind of distance myself from others so I don\u2019t bother anyone (usually this just means taking a nap, or laying in bed and resting). \n\nHowever, since Max and I live (and are quarantined) together it\u2019s hard to distance from each other and she has been trying so hard to fix things and be super helpful when I\u2019m feeling badly. Along with this she tries to tell me what I have to do, even when I know doing something differently would be healthy and safe. I definitely appreciate it and I tell her all the time that I appreciate her being here for me, but I also tell her that I can take care of myself and make safe decisions for my body. \nAll that to say, she definitely knows it bothers me sometimes because I vocalize it. \n\nA few days ago we had a big argument because I had a low-grade fever and she wanted to drive me to a hospital, but I called my oncologist and he said I would be okay at home as long as I checked my temp every 30min and it didn\u2019t rise. I kept telling her what my oncologist said, and telling her that if my temp started to rise I would go without arguing, but she kept trying to tell me what she thought was the best thing to do (even though my doctor was saying differently). I kept repeatedly telling her I was fine and she didn\u2019t have to take care of me (it wasn\u2019t a yelling match, but definitely firm and intense voices), and she got mad that I wasn\u2019t listening to her and we haven\u2019t really talked in 2 days because of it. \n\nHonestly, I definitely understand that she wants to help take care of me because cancer is a lot to deal with, but at the same time I feel like my opinions should matter too? I\u2019ve talked to close friends and my dad about this and they think I overreacted and should have just let her help. \n\nAm I the a-hole for getting mad and not listening to her when she tried to take care of me?",

It's totally reasonable for you to make your own decisions about your health though, especially when they're rational decisions. \n\nI know this is easier said that done, but you need to talk about this when you're both feeling a little more calm (i.e. not in the heat of the moment) and reach some agreement about how you're going to handle the small things that will inevitably pop up. \n\nI have loved ones going through the same thing at the moment, and he (the cancer patient) has a tendency to be a little *too* chill about symptoms (\"it's just a few chest pains!\") while she goes to the opposite extreme (\"we need to call the doctor about your bloodshot eyes!\"). They're learning to just meet in the middle a bit, but it's not easy.\n\nI hope the side effects go away asap and take the cancer with them. All the best, OP!",
