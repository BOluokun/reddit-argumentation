  "post content": "My (f26) husband (m26) works long days. Pretty much 7AM-6PM, sometimes even later. (He is a utility locator, if that's helpful. And spring-summer is the busiest time.)\n\nHe sets his alarm for 5:30 AM. Every morning. Even on weekends because he is fearful of it not working when it needs to. No matter how many times I try to explain that you can set a schedule for it.\n\nWe don't actually get up right when the alarm goes off, we generally push snooze until it's 6 or 6:30. His workday starts whenever he gets in his company vehicle and drives to a ticket.\n\n\nWhy he sets it for 5:30 is a mystery. I am not a morning person, and he is the one who presses snooze.\n\nI repeat, I am not a morning person. And lately, I have been having trouble sleeping. Yet my husband insists that I get up with him so I can make his work lunch. \nWell, today, I had a particularly hard time getting up. And while getting up, I was in a fog. So I moved slower than normal. I had decided to give him leftover pasta salad and make him a sandwich to go with it.\nWhilst I was in the kitchen, he recieved 3 emergency calls. Which meant he had to leave before I could finish packing his lunch. I hadn't even pulled out the salad yet due to having trouble finding any deli meat for his sandwich. \nHe began rushing me and telling me \"This is why I pester you to get up. Did you even start on my lunch?\"\nI said \"I was trying find-\" but he cut me off. \n\"I guess no lunch for me then.\" He snapped while pouring himself coffee in a travel mug.\nI shushed him, which I guess was the wrong thing to do.\nHe started ranting at me about how it's always so difficult to get me up. \nI snapped and said \"Well maybe you should be a man and pack your own lunch from now on! That's what *family member who has the same job* does!\"\nHusband snaps back \"Well, I'm not him and you're not *his wife*!\"\n\nI said \"Glad that's clear, either way, expect me not get up at all next week and pack your own lunch from now on.\"\n\nIn the midst of all this, I had packed him a container of the salad and a fork. At least it was something. \nHe stormed out as soon as I had zipped his lunchbox for him. \n\nI know a lot of this was said in frustration, but I admit I do envy the family members who are in the same positions as us. The wife and I are both stay at home moms with toddlers, yet she's not expected to always pack her husband's lunch. He just grabs whatever's in the fridge or preps it at night so he can grab and go the next morning. I tried doing that for my husband and he complained about it not being fresh. \nI should point out the family member is in his late 30s, so I guess it's a matter of maturity. \n\nBut I feel the need of outsider's opinions. \nAm I the a-hole here?\n\nUpdate: I posted an update in the comments, but I am sure it has been buried by now.\nWe talked it out. We agreed it would be a good idea that IF I was to keep packing his lunches, I will do it at night from now on. \nI actually like packing his lunches, it's the getting up that early in the morning that is my main issue. \nHe DOES appreciate me, and said so. I know everyone here has a perfect man who has never made mistakes nor snapped at you when feeling rushed. But I am happy my man isn't perfect because he would be boring. I'm not perfect either and can list many mistakes I have made. I know I have posted things here before about my husband. And the responses to those posts have helped us discuss the problems. You are only seeing small blurbs of out life. Not all of it. Remember that when people post about an issue in their relationships. \nThank you for the comments, either way.",

Your guy is extremely unreasonable and also very selfish considering that snooze button is the devil! I also cannot get back to sleep when snooze is hit and I warned my hubby if he tried to use the snooze button, I'd toss the alarm out the window. Your hubby needs to stop being so selfish about this and have some compromise. The food being packed the night before and sitting in the fridge is absolutely NO different to packing it that morning. You aren't cooking him a hot meal and putting it in a container, it's all cold! You poor thing.. NTA",

I've made several days worth of sandwiches before for my SO at the time's grandmother who forgot how to cook, with crusts cut off as otherwise she would tear off most of the sandwich, of varying fillings, and they were never soggy. Something else seems like it's going on.  \n\n\nI don't know, if I am giving benefit of the doubt, maybe this is his way of feeling loved by you and being given special attention? Especially if you have children, maybe the having lunch freshly made for him in the morning, is the only time he feels like your attention is solely on him? Before the kids are up, he gets to have some alone time with his wife who is going out of her way to make him something fresh so that when he's at work feeling overwhelmed, he opens up his box and smiles?  \n\n\nIn my case, not a SAHM, but I know my partner loves when I prep the coffeemaker the night before and set the Zojirushi to cook his oatmeal to be ready when he wakes up. He said it starts off his day feeling loved.   \n\n\nI think maybe just ask him why it's so important? Seems like it's more than taste. PS for thermoses, I love Zojirushi ones for keeping things hot during winter. I've legit left a piping hot thermos of coffee overnight and it was still warm the next morning.
