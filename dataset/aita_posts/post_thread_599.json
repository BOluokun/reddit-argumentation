Her, her husband ( my childhood friend) and I were all talking on the phone about hanging out and what we would do over the weekend.

To which I respond \"don't do that M, what about your cat who will look after and love your cat if you do\" M then replies \"my husband will take care of the cat\" then I say \"how can you be sure of that M?\" She then says \"because if he doesn't I will haunt him\" I then reply with \"M you can't haunt him ghost aren't real\". Then my friend then yells at me to \"cut out that atheist bull crap\" and just as the theological argument was about to start as I could tell in the tone of M's voice as well as her going just \"because you can't prove they aren't real doesn't make you right\" to which I made up an excuse to get off the phone. so now I'm sitting here annoyed and frustrated because I feel like augments and situations like these are all to common and because of M's mental illness I'm always at a disadvantage and end up being the \"Bad Guy\" So I need to know am I the A-hole or better yet what to do in the future in situations like this? \n\nfor info I'm a Atheist and my friend is Agnostic",

Her emotions were triggered from your opposing views - so I\u2019d suggest if you are aware of a conversation topic that may trigger her to avoid it. Unfortunately this sensitivity is common for people with BPD. I have BPD so I speak from experience. \n\nAlso, this may not be the case for everyone but statements like \u201cdon\u2019t you want to stay alive for X\u201d - may cause the person to feel guilt and have a negative reaction / more depressed from that question.",
