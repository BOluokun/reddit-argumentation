  "post content": "This first paragraph will probably make me sound like the a**hole, but please keep reading beyond that. \n\nMy fiance is 5 months pregnant. During this pregnancy, our sex life has virtually disappeared. She doesn't want to have sex, kiss, touch, or even so much as hug. Because my main form of emotional expression is through touch, this has left me feeling hurt and rejected. I've been pretty positive, but one day she used my laptop and saw recent porn usage. She has no problem with me watching porn, but she knows it's something I haven't really watched in years. This led to her asking me if our lack of sex has been hard on me. I admitted it has. She told me she just hasn't had a sex drive after becoming pregnant, and that she's sorry that she's been physically and emotionally distant. We talked things out, and the conversation went great.\n\nAt first, I was okay with everything. I would continue taking care of myself sexually and form a better connection with her outside of the bedroom. But not long after that conversation, I found a recently used dildo under our bed. I asked her that I thought her sex drive was gone. She admitted that she's still been masturbating regularly, almost every day. Naturally, this kinda hurt because I wondered how she could have drive to have sex with a toy, but not with me. I expressed this and she suggested that I get a toy as well.\n\nI bought a toy for myself. It was a standard fleshlight that I only used a couple times. Fast forward a month, and we were cleaning out our house. She grabbed a box which I had hid the toy in, and asked what was in it. Embarrassed, I said \"oh it's just a couple of books\". She started to open it and I stopped her and she asked again what was in it. I said \"It's a sex toy\". She immediately stormed out because she said I lied to her by telling her it was something else, which I guess is true. I just panicked because I didn't want her to see it. She left and went to her mom's house to stay the night there.\n\nShe was texting me saying that she can't trust me, and then that turned into her being mad about me having a fleshlight, even though she was the one who suggested I get a toy since we wouldn't be having much sex for awhile. I pointed this out and also the fact that she owned a dildo. Her counterargument was that her dildo was purple so that made it unrealistic, but the fact that the fleshlight was skin colored made it almost the same as cheating, and accused me of wanting to sleep with someone else, which is nowhere near remotely true.\n\nSo, people of reddit, AITA for this fight? Or is my fiance overblowing the situation?",

You can just tell her that it is modeled after some nonexistant humanoid, like a succubus or something. Then it's no different from having Thanos' dick under her bed.\n\nEDIT: The hormones might be the reason for why she is being an asshole but that does not excuse her behavior.",
