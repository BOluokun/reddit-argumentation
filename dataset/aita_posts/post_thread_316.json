The problem is my husband has recently told me he wants to teach her Spanish too.\n\nThe thing is, he isn\u2018t even Spanish! He was born here but lived on Spain since he was 4 until he was 19. Now, if he had some sort of cultural or family connection to Spain then I might consider it. But he is American!\n\nWhen he initially told me at around 21 weeks I thought he was joking so I let it go, but now that he brought it up again I told him how I felt about it.\n\nI told him what I told you guys above and that it would be hard for her because they are very different languages.\n\nHe started arguing that there are many kids that are raised bilingual and are very smart but I also feel like it might cut me from my child.\n\nHe is mad at me for not accepting and I can\u2019t help but wonder if I was an asshole here.",

It has never cut off a parent and child (I just did a quick tally, and I know 26 kids who are half Japanese half other, live in Japan, and bilingual, and 4 that also speak Spanish or Indonesian). \n\nFirst, as the parent in the non-dominant home language, you pick it up pretty darn fast. My friend was even worse than me at Japanese despite living here 6+ years more than I, but now he\u2019s conversational at best, because his kids speak both all of the time. It\u2019s a great chance for the parent to learn the second language too!\n\nSecondly, learning another language early on is really, really great. Of those 20+ kids, a few of them are in college and essentially polyglots - one now speaks Italian, French, and a bit of Korean, another can speak Korean, Mandarin, some Tagalog and is learning Classical Japanese just for fun, on top of English. \n\nIt helps you build those pathways. I never learned a second language (well, I started to, but had a teacher in the US in my formative years who bullied me for mixing up words like Dog and Hund so I suppressed everything I knew about German/Dutch to the point that it impacted my ability to process language in the first place) and am struggling daily with Japanese despite living here for almost a decade. I wish I had that drive. \n\nMy friend from high school is a university professor in Spanish lit, and her daughter speaks Spanish fluently despite no connection to Spain other than a few trips. The kiddo goes with her mom to conferences, and they always make a point of learning basic phrases in the local language. When they were in Japan, she just had to hear a word once or twice in Japanese was and she could use it days later, it\u2019s amazing how brains get wired! She even picked up the sound nuances it took me a few years to even be able to hear the difference in (\u201csu\u201d \u30b9 vs \u201ctsu\u201d \u30c4 for example)\n\nI love languages, and wish I had an aptitude for them. This soon-to-be-mom is depriving her child of something that the kid will grow to regret. \n\nPlus, who cares if Spanish time is \u201cdad time?\u201d Like, that\u2019s the absolute best way I can imagine them bonding, and I\u2019d be so proud of my husband if he took that on and used it to help build a great relationship with the kid!",

In the Netherlands, all my schooling was in Dutch, and in Germany it was mixed immersion. \n\nBecause of this, little first grade baby me didn\u2019t understand that there were different languages, because I could answer in Dutch, German, or English, and my teachers understood. Flash forward to Wisconsin. I\u2019ll set the scene. \n\nWe were poor, like home made clothes and hand me downs poor. I was the new kid at school, joining midway through the year. I was the youngest, because cut offs were different for ages for starting school in Europe. And I was always just kinda that awkward girl. \n\nMy teacher actually got joy out of ridiculing me, because (as she told my mother when she came in for a conference) \u201cshe thinks she\u2019s better than us because she lived somewhere exotic.\u201d My mother finds this hilarious to this day, the idea of a German air base as exotic, with our random bombings by the red army and terrorist drills. But I digress. \n\nThis woman would single me out and make me stand up in front of the whole class when I answered an \u201cobvious\u201d question wrong. Some examples were mixing up animal names (cat vs katze \u201cshe doesn\u2019t even know what a cat is!\u201d), counting weird (id count in some mixed up version of German, Dutch and English and it was hilarious in retrospect!), and using the wrong letter pronunciations for sounding out new words with phonics. \n\nI started having (what I now know were) panic attacks every morning, vomiting uncontrollably. I still can\u2019t eat breakfast and I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s.\n\nI found out years later that she had been in trouble before for doing this to ESL learners, but nothing came of it because schools in the 80\u2019s were the Wild West of shittery. She was old by the time I had her, and according to friends I met later in high school who had her who happened to be anything other than lily white, a racist too. Like watermelons and fried chicken jokes with first graders. \n\nSo that\u2019s how idiocy like this perpetuates. This fear that knowing more than them about *anything* means you\u2019re looking down on them, instead of embracing our differences and learning from each other throughout life. \n\nOh, and as for my language skills. I had such a hard time that my mother took me out of school early that year and homeschooled for the rest until we moved across the country, but the damage was done. They thought I had cognitive issues because all language was suddenly panic inducing. Spelling tests could cause me to puke and pass out, and it took until college to manage to read a written speech in front of others. I developed a terrible stutter in that time, too, as my brain would just lock up out of fear I was saying it wrong. And now, I can\u2019t audibly process languages right, so despite literally being immersed in a language for 10 years now, I can barely make small talk in Japanese no matter how hard I try. I can read pretty well, though, go figure. \n\nSorry, this rant was actually rather cathartic. I didn\u2019t mean to dump all that, honestly!",

I made so many wonderful friends.  The food was much healthier.   Everyone was thin and fit from all the walking and healthy diet. In fact, one of my American classmates lost about 25 pounds.   The women were really beautiful.  I swear some of my female friends could have won a beauty parent.  One of my friends, Rosa, lived on a farm in Peligros.

That's rich. YTA 100 times over.",
