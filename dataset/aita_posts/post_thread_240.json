  "post content": "I (37f) have two kids with my husband (41m); a 14-year-old daughter and a 10 year-old son.\n\nOur daughter has always been a little socially awkward to the point that we've had her tested since we suspected her of being on the spectrum. Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert.\n\nHowever, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night.\n\nSo, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; \"Are you enjoying the food?\" She responded \"Yes! \\[Your husband\\] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman.\"\n\nThe room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night.\n\nThis was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her \"Sure; if she's going to apologize to me.\" When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again.\n\nShe then went to her father and asked. He said \"sure\" but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: \"\\[Daughter's friend\\]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go?\"\n\nYes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and myy daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.",

I did a similar thing at 15 (not insulting anyone, just awkward and making dumb teenager choices after I got emancipated), and I was staying with a friend for the summer (end of July through August, and stayed with other friend through October and moved to a new city in November). I tried to help with chores and offered money for my stay, but they wouldn't let me help *at all*, and then would bring up money and expenses and make me feel terrible. \n\nI was staying with them in upstate NY (I am from Tx, met my friends up there through World of Warcraft, saved up money and came to visit), and I ended up bonding with her kid more than another friend I came to visit. My friend wanted me to stay with them, so with their permission I did for a while until I found a place to stay in town. I was sleeping in a heated barn out behind their house, too, not in the house. \n\nMy friend saw I was lonely a bit (since I came across the country from Texas), and since I was there possibly permanently (in NY, not their backyard), they got me a kitten.\n\nShe BLEW UP. Apparently not allowed (even though they have barn cats and it wasn't in the house itself). It went downhill fast. *She locked me out of the house in the snow without a coat* because she \"just didn't like me\" and \"was worried I was going to take her child away from her\". My friend's parent started hounding and harrassing me for not being more like my friend's other friends. She was an older woman who had a boob job and walked around without a bra, around her childrens' friends.\n\nI got a yeast infection (sorry, TMI) and went to a local Planned Parenthood-like clinic. I came home, did the treatment, no big deal (I thought). The next day, she comes running up to me and my friend with a paper in her hand, calling me a whore. She was ranting and raving . \"IT'S NOT DEBBIE DOES DALLAS, IT'S LUCKY-FU DOES TEXAS. WHY ARE YOU GETTING INFECTIONS LIKE THIS? I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU IS FRIENDS WITH MY CHILD, YOU ARE DIRTY\" I realized she had been going through my things in the shed, because it was my clinic paperwork that was under my bed inside my suitcase. I had 0 defense (grew up in narcissistic household and was the scapegoat). I just cried. And she felt triumphant.\n\nObviously I wasn't there much longer and my friend and I didn't really stay close either.\n\nI'll never forget it. An adult treating a child/teenager like they were another adult they were in some kind of weird competition with (I suspect due to body image issues). I own up that I made plenty of errors in judgment, but that could have been a sit-down talk or two, not screaming in my face over unrelated things.\n\nI'm sure I made more mistakes than what is here, I just don't know what the things were because she never explained and just attacked me verbally. I was saying/doing the wrong things, and she built up resentment instead of just talking to me and telling me what I was doing/saying wrong.\n\nTEENAGERS NEED GUIDANCE IF THEY ARE MAKING A MISTAKE, NOT ABUSE.\n\nIf OP's daughter's friend said anything again, OP could just explain that it bothers her without making the friend feel like she's a bad person (by doing things like demanding an apology and threatening punishment). If someone accidentally hurt my feelings and then never said anything like it again, I'd just let it go.\n\nEdit: Whoever posted the \"uncivil\" message to me, I am really curious about what you said to have your comment removed.\n\nAlso, YTA OP.",

I\u2019m an obese guy, if someone points that out to me with no malicious intentions how on earth am I going to demand an apology for stating a fact? Your husband is right. Get over your bruised ego for your daughter\u2019s sake. Is it an insult to say someone is tall, short, curly-haired or brown-eyed? She didn\u2019t make fun of you. Why should you get an apology?",

If it's true then is a fact, don't get bad about the truth. If it's a lie, then why would you get bad about it? It is not true, just correct it and continue with your life and brush it off. That's how I usually live my life and almost nothing makes me mad, because is either a lie or my fault, nothing to be offended about.",

And who knows how many of those descriptors happen to apply here, but it is possibly all of them but if not it is at least the first two.\n\nI am still mortified to this day about things I said as a kid that I didn't realize sounded mean or rude. This girl will remember this situation for literally the rest of her life, when it could have been remembering wonderful moments with her friend. \n\nI have run into situations like this countless times where a person will think I am making a judgement about them when really it is just an observation or statement with literally no judgement. But unfortunately we live in a society that equates \"being a bigger woman\" with \"not valuable, very bad, etc\" and so that is all OP heard when her daughter's friend said that.\n\nOP I IMPLORE you to please understand that it was a mistake, she likely did not mean to sound judgemental, and your daughter is the one ultimately suffering for not getting to enjoy her ONLY FRIEND. And if you do decide to have her over again, and the friend seems untalkative, do not interpret that as rude either; she is embarrassed and doesn't know how to talk to you anymore.",

It just meant they enjoy what you make so much they continue to eat it. The child probably wouldn't have made the comment if they thought being plump was something to be ashamed of. If OP would have responded, \"I know, right! He takes good care of me!\" it would be a different scenario. Maybe in the child's mind she was thinking about how she hates to eat at home because her mom's a bad cook, and that lead her to observe that OP is a little bigger, therefore she must enjoy the husband's cooking also. **The poor awkward child was actually trying to bond with OP over what a great time she was having.** I hope OP continues to let the friend come over and maybe one day it can be a joke between them.",
