  "post content": "I (21f) usually always sit with the same group of people in my university\u2019s dining area. \nThere\u2019s this girl who i\u2019ve talked to a few times, but i\u2019m not really friends with. She\u2019s kind of quiet, but when she finally talks she seems normal. \nI\u2019ve sat across from her a few times and noticed how she was eating because it was weird to me. She eats maybe half of her food (keep in mind you control the amount of food. it\u2019s cooked by the cafeteria staff buffet-style. \nshe could easily take less) and kind of plays with it with her fork when she\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d (aka eating half of it, sometimes even less). \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything for a while, but a few weeks ago I had to ask her why she always only ate half her food. She seemed a  embarrassed, but answered she thought she was more hungry and laughed it off. I then asked her why she made this mistake every time we ate, and that she must have learned by now. \nShe didn\u2019t really answer (I don\u2019t actually remember, but it wasn\u2019t actually an explanation) and left pretty quickly. \nShe doesn\u2019t really show up that much anymore, but when she does she still eats like this, and I couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. I asked her once again, and also asked her if her parents never told her not to play with her food. \n\nIt was a genuine question, some people are raised in households where manners aren\u2019t important, but obviously they are for most people. She got really mad at me and told me to stop commenting on her eating habits and that it was none of my business. I told her that it absolutely was since she was sitting at our table and obviously wasting food. She told me to go fuck myself and left and threw out the rest of her food (AGAIN!) \nAfter she left, one of my friends told me to leave her alone as she seemed like she was having a hard time and maybe had some sort of issue with food. \nYeah, obviously she has an issue with food?? She keeps wasting it! She hasn\u2019t shown up again, i\u2019m assuming she buys her own food now, which might teach her not to waste it so that\u2019s good. The same friend who told me to leave her alone keeps pestering me to apologise to her, but I think she should apologise to me. She\u2019s unnecessarily rude when being asked the most basic and obvious questions and also told me to go fuck myself? That\u2019s way more harsh than anything i\u2019ve ever told her. \nKeep in mind that I care a lot about food waste and the environment.\nAITA for telling a girl to stop wasting food?\n\n\nEDIT: OK! I\u2019m the asshole! Sorry i\u2019m not studying to be an eating disorder specialist. I looked up stuff about it and i\u2019m realising I was too harsh. I\u2019ll apologise the next time I see her and try not to be so condescending. But you should all follow your own advice. If people genuinely don\u2019t know something you should tell them nicely instead, and i realise i should\u2019ve tried to educate her NICELY about food waste and not have commented at all on how she was eating",

We figured \u201chey, might as well get two uses out of them? Better for the planet?\u201d\n\nBut she was adamant that we shouldn\u2019t use plastic bags at the grocery store at all, and should only use reusable (nice idea. But we often forgot.). Paper at our local store wasn\u2019t an option. \n\nWhich meant carrying all your stuff in your arms was the right thing to do, if you forgot your reusable bag. Never accept plastic bags. \n\nWe asked what she proposed we do to line the trash can and she said we should use nothing \ud83e\udd22 and just scrub the bin by hand if any blood got in it. \n\nShe was majorly outvoted on that one. None of the four of us wanted to scrub each other\u2019s menstrual blood out once a week. \n\nSome people are coming from a good place and trying to help the environment. I can see OP using that as a defense. \n\nBut OP, like my roommate, has to learn to let it go when the other people aren\u2019t interested in the \u201clesson\u201d you\u2019re insisting on teaching them. \n\nIf you must, suggest a better solution ONCE. But if it\u2019s not welcome, move on and don\u2019t be a bully about it. Instead, go do one good deed for the environment instead to negate the little food waste your friend makes that you can\u2019t tolerate.",

To throw out food was bad, to waste the food was bad, Should eat it, or save and eat it, and until I was 18, my mom was firmly the \"Let me plate everyone\" type of woman aside from also being the \"eat everything on your plate\" Type too, so I did not have a good grasp on what actual portioning was or even where to begin to learn how to eat more mindfully. Was up to 370 at my highest before I finally broke myself free of it... and you know how? By telling myself that it's OKAY to stop eating what's on my plate, regardless of if someone else served me or I served myself, and that it's okay to \"Throw out\" food I haven't eaten that I don't plan to eat. Food waste sucks, sure, but it's all shit that breaks down in a landfill or can be composted, so I don't think it's as bad as non-reuseable bottles from bottled water that many of the people who hate on \"Food waste\" but in bulk either. \n\nPeople need to lay off this stupid shit \"Eat everything on your plate\" bit.

With that said, I managed to drop much of my weight after getting a Gastric Sleeve surgery(the initial push down before surgery was done by learning to eat properly instead), and I'm legitimately still at this point where I'm trying to get the right portions on my plate and not \"overeat\". Imagine trying to eyeball 2-4 oz of meat, 2 oz of vegetables and 1 oz of starch or a dessert, and going over by a slight amount. I have to give myself permission to toss what's left over, and so far it's worked well. Last family dinner I went to last month, My aunt tried to tell me to take a fucking full piece of pie, and I told her to shove it and only took the tip, split it with my sister while she bitched about \"Food waste\" and that I'm only eating \"partial servicngs\". Op is definitely TA and I feel would be a lot like my aunt.",
