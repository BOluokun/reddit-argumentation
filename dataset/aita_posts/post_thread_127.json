  "post content": "My boyfriend and I (both 24) live in a tiny 1bedroom 1bathroom apartment in the middle of the city. We moved in a month ago. \n\nA few days after we moved in bf informed me that his dad would be staying for an extended weekend. I was less than thrilled because as I said the apartment is tiny and his dad and I have very different ideas of cleanliness. I also would have preferred to be asked instead of informed. I let bf know but he said it was set and I'd have to deal with it.\nI decided that I won't be staying home that weekend as I needed privacy because I had a research proposal due the next week. So I booked a hotel room in the city. Nothing too fancy but also not a shit hole. Before I did this I told bf that I was very unhappy with how he handled it and let him know about the hotel. He seemed pleased with that. \n\nFil left yesterday and I went back home and as expected the apartment looked horrible. Piss all over the toilet seat, questionable stuff in the sink, spew next to the toilet and lots of beer cans all over the place. Bf was also clearly hungover. \n\nBf and I have a joint account for rent, groceries and other joint expenses but other than that we keep our finances separate. \nToday bf realised that I used our joint account to pay for the hotel room. He was furious. I told him that I had to leave so he and his dad could party and since I pay half the rent to the apartment that I was basically forced to leave I think it was fair for me to use the joint account.\n\nHe disagrees.",
