  "post content": "My 12-year old niece is really into arts and crafts, and recently got into crocheting. Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies). \n\n\nOn Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes. \n\nWhen I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art. \n\nMy niece avoided me for the vast majority of the party after that. I tried to make her feel better by displaying her gift on my living room cabinet, but my wife pulled me aside later in the day and told me to take it down after the party because it was in her words, \"really ugly\" and made her uncomfortable.\n\n\nSurprisingly, all the adults was very understanding of my situation, but I feel really bad because I feel like I destroyed my niece's confidence, and I'm not sure how I can make it up to her.",

Poor kiddo.\n\nEdit: OP if you see this, I bet there are a ton of us who would love to buy one your niece's crocheted creations if you can get her to start making them again, and help her with an Etsy shop. I'll buy the first one.\n\nEdit 2: Really wasn't expecting this to be the top comment. And a lot of people have rightfully suggested that maybe the next best step isn't the niece selling her creations on the internet. Point taken. But I'd still totally buy one of these crocheted animals, so hopefully someday I can.",

So if your grandma made you a sweater with yarn from Walmart, it was going to be fire truck red and itch so bad you would get a rash.\n\n\nWe went through a yarn renaissance in the early 2000\u2019s, and now you\u2019ve got people hand painting yarn that they\u2019ve spun from the fibers they harvested on their yak farm on Etsy. Granted, some people are just really bad with picking colors, so homemade stuff can still end up ugly; but now you\u2019re less likely to end up with acrylic so scratchy that you\u2019re driven insane within thirty minutes of putting it on.",

You look at the supplies needed for the project and you make a shopping list. \n\n2. You call your niece (not her parents, her) and you apologize profusely. You tell her you know you behaved rudely and hurt her and that was wrong. Then you tell her that you learnt that making crochet animals is called amigurumi and that you now know it\u2019s actually really challenging. You tell her that you don\u2019t want her to feel discouraged from making art, and that sometimes learning something takes more time\u2026. \n\nThen you tell her that to apologize and show her that this is about learning and practice, you\u2019d like her to teach YOU how to make one. Tell her you bought the book/class and you\u2019d like the two of you to do it together and she\u2019ll be your tutor (because she spray knows the basics). Tell her that it\u2019s only right you experience how hard that animal was for her to make so she knows your apology is sincere. \n\n3. Send the shopping list to niece + parent so they can tell you what niece sissy has and what you\u2019ll need to buy two of. Buy the shipping list. \n\n4. Make a date to work on the project together and actually follow through. \n\nTHAT\u2019S how you sincerely apologize and help her to know she doesn\u2019t suck at art and encourage her to keep going. It\u2019s also how you gets some perspective on what it took for your niece to make what she made.\n\nETA: thank you so much for the awards. Fingers crossed OP sees this and follows through",

My mom and grandma acted like you had to be an award winning author right from the start. Either you had it or didn't.\n\nSame thing with art. I wasn't good but I enjoyed doing it. Growing up in a very conservative church, I was told that God gifted us special talents so we could use them for his glory. I had it stuck in my head that God didn't \"bless\" me with creative talents so I pretty much stopped trying. \n\nI saw other girls who were more outspoken and outgoing than I was dabble into things I wasn't really comfortable with like singing, speaking, putting on plays, and Bible competitions. Everybody always put the focus on the more extroverted crowd and since I was so quiet and shy but at the same time, attractive, I just ended up being the shy, pretty girl that didn't talk much and didn't have much to offer. That really crushed my self esteem.\n\nI thought that my measly writing and crappy drawings didn't even come close to the other girls talents. I also figured God didn't bestow those gifts on to me for a reason so there was no reason to pursue those endeavors. Just another reason why I gave up on religion because all it did was cause resentment. \n\nIt didn't help that I was a serial procrastinator that pretty much gave up on projects the minute I got overwhelmed or too focused on trying to make my writing and art \"perfect.\" It wasn't until years later that I figured out that you don't have to be freaking Shakespeare to enjoy art.\n\nRecently, I've been writing, drawing, and painting a lot more than I used to. I decided to let that resentment go. If it's a hobby that you genuinely like, then go for it!

For a lot of people, uncontrollable laughter is an unfortunate physiological response to anxiety. It often manifests at inopportune and inappropriate times and is misconstrued as derisive and mean-spirited. When that happens, it only intensifies the anxiety which in turn prompts more laughter. OP\u2019s initial laughter was unfortunate, and perhaps inappropriate enough to warrant an asshole verdict, but I feel like the inability to stop laughing isn\u2019t as illustrative of ill-intent as people are making it out to be. If anything, needing ten minutes to get it under control even though he\u2019s expressed contrition about it actually supports the possibility of a physiological cause.",

There are increases and decreases which can be tricky and also depending on the yarn it can be made easier or harder based on type and quality. It probably took OP's niece a decent amount of time and we also don't know if she has a template or a video to help her - if she created it by herself that's even worse because sometimes you have to play with it if you don't have something to help you see what you need to do to get the right shape. YTA OP you probably ruined her confidence and she might never pick it up again. Hell if my bf reacted like you did when I gave him a pretty misshapen scarf for our anniversary (my first work) I would have never touched crocheting again.",
