Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.\n\nSo my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we\u2019ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it\u2019s become a great tradition in our social circle. \n\nOur friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now.\n\nDuring our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn\u2019t push the issue. \n\nHowever, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. \n\nMy wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don\u2019t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don\u2019t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. For the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. AITA?",

Even then, everyone I know that likes to host cookouts and stuff will bare minimum keep some black bean burgers or something in the freezer as \"emergency rations,\" or ask them to bring/recommend something to throw on for them. Plus I would say a great number of dishes can be easily set up to easily divide out a vegan portion from the main affair if its too much of a bother. Plenty of things add the meat or dairy at the very end, oils can replace butter in a number of applications, veg stock instead of meat stock is perfectly viable. As an easy example I just made gumbo for a mixed preference crowd, I just reserved portions when the meat went in and simmered it separately, nbd.
