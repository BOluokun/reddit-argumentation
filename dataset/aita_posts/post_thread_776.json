  "post content": "Y'all this is such a juvenile situation but my feelings are hurt and I'm not sure if I'm being immature/sensitive. Long time lurker of AITA, first time poster. Throwaway.\n\nCast: Me (22F), Cori (28F), Sio (28F). All in a phd program together. \n\nI became friends with both long ago, when the program started. Got along with them great. Didn't love how Sio talked about other people, but felt it wasn't my circus. Then one day, Sio sits me down and LISTS all the ways I am a bad person and what I need to fix. Given that we are grown-ass adults, I took it to heart - figured I need to improve, but of course I was sad that my personality sucked. Told Cori about it and she basically went \"Pump the breaks, Sio is being bitchy. If she doesn't like you, she's allowed to but you don't have to 'fix' yourself per her criteria. Your personality doesn't suck, if it did, why would I or anyone else be your friend.\" Which flipped on the light in my head that Sio isn't my kind of person, and looking back, realized she had been bullying me - small digs, makes fun of me in public, always commenting on what I eat, making derogatory comments about my hair, how I wouldn't win in this little contest we were both in (I already thought I wouldn't win since I didn't have much experience since I'm 22 and she's 28, so I brought up the concern, and she agreed I wouldn't win). To reduce drama (ugh are we all 13), I just stopped hanging out with Sio, and Cori knew of this and encouraged 'cutting bullies out of my life'. Simple, clean.\n\nThen I find out that last weekend, Sio and Cori and their one friend *went to a party together*. They did boozy brunch, got manis, pregamed, and then went to the party with their wives (all same-sex couples). And I didn't hear of it until I saw the Instagram posts. This suggests a close bond between them. And I feel betrayed by Cori's closeness to Sio. I approached her and said I feel betrayed that Cori, who I consider my closest friend in the phd program, is so close with the girl she ENCOURAGED me to cut off. Cori told me I'm being oversensitive and touchy and she's allowed to be friends with whoever she wants was long as they're not racist/homophobic/anything like that, and since Sio was never mean to Cori, only to me, so why would Cori cut Sio off. Now I'm sad *and* baffled, and that's too many emotions.",

You saw Sio being a complete bitch to others, accepted it because she hadn\u2019t yet done that to you and it \u201cwasn\u2019t your circus,\u201d and continued to hang out with her. Now that Cori does it, you have a problem with it? I would to, but I wanted to point out the hypocrisy. \n\nYou are right to cut out Sio. You are even right to cut out Cori if that\u2019s not a healthy relationship for you either. Ultimately, do what makes you happy. But from here out, if you see someone being a shitty human, then speak up. \n\nYou can\u2019t control what anyone does. Only what you do. That\u2019s part of adulting. If you explain to Cori why it hurts you that she continues to hang out with Sio, someone she told you to cut out, and she doesn\u2019t want to end the relationship, then you have no choice but to accept that and act accordingly. Maybe to Cori, it\u2019s \u201cnot her circus.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019ll be fine. Focus on school. You have so much life ahead of you.",
