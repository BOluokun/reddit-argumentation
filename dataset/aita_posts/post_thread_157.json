  "post content": "I  recently moved into a property that backs up to an HOA neighborhood, my  yard adjacent to about 4 of theirs. I am not part of the HOA. The road  to my house is a small private road and runs parallel to their private  road. \n\nSo when I first moved in the  county told me my trash pickup location was on their road, mine's not  got a good spot for a trash truck to turn around. After about 2 pickups I  find a note on my trashcan with the usual HOA BS, can't leave me can on  their road, etc. etc. Whatever, I take it to the end of my road and  that works fine.\n\nNext I try and  get hooked up with gas, because electric heating's expensive AF. Nearest  gas line runs down their road, the utility is cool with it but they  block the construction. Fine, I install a tank and shortly thereafter  get another note on my door saying the noise from the installation was  disturbing and the tank is an eyesore. It's a buried tank, and you can't  even see the cap from the HOA properties.\n\nThat was  that for around 6 months except a few complaints of me mowing outside of  HOA designated mowing hours (but within county hours), until a flat bed  with a backhoe backs into my driveway. I walk out to see what's going  on, apparently the sewer connection for the HOA runs under my property,  something's clogged and they need to tear the pipe up to get a look.\n\nLong  story short, apparently the builder had some handshake deal with the  previous owner about that sewer line and gave up a few bucks to let them  run it through the property. No easement on the deed, nothing in  writing. I sent backhoe guy off.\n\nNext  HOA President comes and knocks on my door, tells me the sewer is  causing backup in several of the houses and no one can use their  toilets, shower, run sinks, etc. until it's fixed and rerunning the  sewer down their road instead of across my property is going to cost  millions they don't have and take months. I said something like \"Man,  that sucks for you guys, hope you get it fixed soon. Sign says no  trespassing though, so if you could keep off the property I'd appreciate  it. Have a nice day.\" I got a letter from their lawyer with a lot of  threats a bit later but didn't see much to back them up legally, figure  they can take me to court if they want.\n\nThey've had some giant loud ass mobile poop tank stuck in someone's back yard for the past 3 months and I see no signs of new pipe. A few of the HOA  residents stopped by and said the houses were  basically unlivable with the pump, could only take 5 minutes showers, only flush #2, can't sleep from the noise, costs a lot, someone lost a house sale, etc. and they didn't have any part of the HOA stupidity other than living in it. I told them I feel for them but that HOA's been a pain in my rear since week 1 and I'm not inclined to let them go  driving construction equipment across and digging holes in a yard I  worked pretty hard on after the way they've been treating me. They told  me I was an asshole.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

Document everything.\n\ntalk to a lawyer asap, pretty sure having the pipe etc under your property is illegal\u2026 So that\u2019s why you should talk to a lawyer about suing them or making a deal and forcing them to pay for the removal of the pipe and everything and then putting your yard back to how it was. \n\nTell the homeowners they should talk to a lawyer because what their HOA did was illegal and after how they treated you, you can\u2019t believe they have the audacity to expect you to destroy your yard!",

The concern being there could be a future blockage caused by that many people that then erupts so to speak on your property that they stick you with fixing.",
