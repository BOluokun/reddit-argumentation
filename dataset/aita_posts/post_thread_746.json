I also have a mild case of Agroaphobia where I hate going outside during the day, it makes me very anxious to go outside, sometimes I think the brink of a panic attack.  \n\n      Some issues I have had: These have been accusing ever since my fear of being touched started to rise around 10 or 11. At first, I have confused why it repulsed to be hugged by my family. I began asking them to please not touch me or hug me because it makes me feel trapped and scared. They always ignored me and continued to forcefully hug me saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just a hug we are your family.\u201d over the years have gained a very deep hatred for them with the lack of them even trying to understand. There have been many screaming matches and me running away for a couple of hours to calm myself down. My mom (39F) always tells me I\u2019m overreacting and I should open up more because the fear of being touched isn\u2019t supposed to hold up for family, even though I have expressed it does.. \n\n   A cut down version of the situation: \n\n On Christmas, they wanted to take a picture and told us to stand next to each other. I didn\u2019t want to put an arm around my brother or sister (19F). They began telling me to just do it because it was just a picture and my began trying to force his hand around my shoulder. I flinched back scared and my mom rolled her eyes annoyed and told me never mind. I was pushed and said to just accept I hate being touch. She quickly snapped back it was not normal, and I yelled at her what\u2019s not normal is that none of you are accepting I hate it and keep trying to force it and somehow turning it back into me. She said she didn\u2019t want to get into an argument over something so stupid. I quickly told her she sucks as a good parent and shouldn\u2019t have had kids if you weren\u2019t ready to be an adult about things like this. I sat in my bed crying silently and hyperventilating from my brothers arm reaching for me while they began taking picture of my sister and brother hugging and laughing about now it looks good without the weirdo. Today, they are acting like nothing has happened and are confused about my shut off attitude? \n\n   So AITA for telling her she sucks at parenting for not being a grown up?\n\nUpdate: Officially diagnosed with Haphephobia by a professional. Since then, I have now been treated as a \u201cfreak\u201d. I am not allowed in family photos because the no touching makes it \u201cnot so family like\u201d and I am still forcefully hugged and touched while they laugh at me. I believe they aren\u2019t ever gonna change and I should accept this as my new normal..",
