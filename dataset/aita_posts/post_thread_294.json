  "post content": "Background: My wife rarely goes out with friends (~6 times/year) and has never been very social and prefers spending time with me. I am more social, but that has declined as we have focused on our family (we have a 2 year old daughter), and I spend time with the same 3 friends once/week for games night (sometimes in person, sometimes online). I have another 3 friends that I see only once every 2 months, also for games night. If I go out my wife will tend to our daughter (I often still help with dinner/bed time, but sometimes leave earlier than this). Our daughter's bed time is 7:30pm, and she often sleeps through the night without fuss (wakes up fussing maybe 5% of the time). I always offer for my wife sleep in the next day, or something similar in exchange for me going out so that It's not a one-sided thing.\n\nScenario: My wife made plans to spend an evening this weekend out with friends, she would be out from 6pm until late. After she made those plans, I was invited to my friends birthday thing with my \"second\" friend group, if I went I would be gone from 5pm until late. Last time I saw them was exactly one month ago. I brought this plan up with my wife as I wanted to make arrangements for a family member to take our daughter for the evening. She was irritated by this, and argued that I should stay home. I have since spoken with a family member who is happy to take our daughter at 5pm and have her stay the night and I have communicated this to my wife.\n\nI made it clear that this will not affect her plans at all, I will be responsible for dropoff and pickup of our daughter, and will not ask anything of my wife because I understand that it is rare for her to have a night out like this and so I don't want her to change her plans at all. She still thinks that I should stay home.\n\nHer arguments:\n\n- She says that since she always covers for me that I should also cover for her\n- She doesn't want to ask this family member to have our daughter for the night because she thinks we ask too much of them\n\nMy arguments:\n\n- I am covering for her as she does not have to change her plans and doesn't have to do anything for our daughter\n- This family member loves watching our daughter, and my wife is often quick to agree to leave our daughter there for sleepovers plenty of other evenings out of convenience (eg: we will be there for dinner and put our daughter to sleep there so we can visit longer, then we will leave her there for the night) so I don't see why this time its too much to ask\n\nI feel like she wants me to stay home as a form of punishment for going out more frequently than she would prefer. \"Punishment\" feels too strong of a word, I don't think there is any major resentment behind this or anything, I just don't know how else to describe the feeling.\n\nSo, AITA here for making plans to go out the same night my wife also already had plans to go out, even though I am covering all arrangements for our daughter for the evening?\n\nEdits:\n\n- Not sure why everyone thinks I'm planning on getting drunk, but I would not be drinking if I went to the birthday.\n- I would also be the \"on-call\" parent and would tend to our daughter in case of any emergency\n- I used the word \"cover\" to describe solo-parenting as that is the word my wife used when we spoke. Neither of us are the type of people to call parenting \"babysitting\" when it is solo.\n- The \"punishment\" I am referring to is about missing out on celebrating with a friend, it is NOT referring to spending time with my daughter\n- Just because my wife only goes out 6 times a year does not mean that is her only free time. We have 5 evenings free every week where she can either do her own thing or we can spend it together. We share the evening \"on-duty\" time equally\n- The vast majority (like 90% or more) of my time out is spent after my daughter is asleep, the normal routine is for both of us to do dinner/bath/bed routine, and then for me to leave afterwards\n- The family member I am referring to is on my wife's side, however we are very close with them and it is normal for me to talk to them directly, they feel just as much my family at this point as they are hers\n- The family member is also very experienced putting our daughter to bed without us being there\n- My daughter has her own room at this family members house, as well as another's. This is because they care for our daughter on the 3 days a week where both my wife and I work so that we don't have to pay for daycare. We are extremely lucky to have such helpful family, and the reason she has her own room/bed at these places isn't because we \"pawn her off\" there frequently, it is because she naps at these places 3 days a week, and on occasional evenings. Both family members are empty nesters who admittedly love caring for our daughter, and other young family members. We try to compensate them but they often refuse, and they even go so far as to ask to have our daughter over.",

She isn\u2019t necessarily going to worry all night, but she will be aware that your daughter is out of the house. She\u2019s going to mentally check in - now they are driving over, now she\u2019s likely settling down, now you are picking her up, time for bed again. \n\nEvery time she mentally check in she exerts a little effort. Maybe she glances out the window to check the weather is good for driving. Maybe she checks her watch or phone to see if you called. However, even the energy of simply having a thought adds up.\n\nIf your wife is like many parents I know, especially the main caregivers, she is always alert. She\u2019s always on. \n\nYou being home with your daughter doesn\u2019t turn that off but it does lesson the amount that it happens. The mental load of knowing your child is as safe as possible with their other parent is different from knowing they are driving around and at another house.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how safe it is - travel needs more attention than staying home.\n\nYou get to go out. You get mental breaks from parenthood. She doesn\u2019t get the same breaks. She\u2019s asking for one now.\n\nYou need to decide - does it really matter who\u2019s right here? Your wife is unhappy. This is rare occurrence for her that means a lot and you see your friends all the time. Even if you think my reasoning is completely irrelevant, is this birthday party *really* worth it?\n\nETA: When posts get this big I like to channel that energy as much as possible towards doing some good in the real world, especially when at the moment, for me, being able to comment at all on something small and innocuous like an Internet stranger deciding whether to use a babysitter currently feels like a luxury. I don\u2019t take it for granted.\n\nwww.NAMI.org is the National Alliance on Mental Illness. They accept donations and have one hotline available for everyone and one specifically for teens and young adults. \n\nwww.2020Mom.org is The Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, aka 2020 Mom. They advocate for policies in America that support the mental health of pregnant women and all parents.\n\nFor those who are focused on wanting to help those affected by bigger issues like war, conflict, and natural disasters due to recent and not so recent events, https://www.charitywatch.org has articles and lists of reliable charities for helping those in specific war zones and other dire situations.\n\nDonations are obviously not the only way to do good. Things as small as being mindful to be patient and kind makes everything a little bit better.\n\nWishing everyone both strong Internet and real world communities and support systems.",

The only difference between our situation & OP\u2019s is that we are not as lucky, in that we don\u2019t have a reliable babysitter. If I were to go out, my partner would definitely have to stay home. But if we did have a babysitting resource like OP, I can see this situation coming up & my partner asking the same question as OP.\n\n& I would react the same as his wife. & I actually would wonder if I were the asshole & it\u2019s almost gratifying to see many people here coming down on the wife\u2019s side, because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to argue that OP\u2019s logic is pretty sound. Yet I, like his wife, would want my partner to stay home & would be upset if he still wanted to go out. & seeing so many people explain why she\u2019s justified to want OP to stay home is reassuring to me.\n\n- The mental load of preparing for the kid\u2019s overnight stay: OP could argue that he\u2019d do all this prep, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to turn my brain off & not think about the logistics of having my kid stay the night at someone else\u2019s house \u2014 BTW has she done this before? Actually stay overnight at this babysitter\u2019s house without either parents? As a parent, I\u2019d have separation anxiety about it, especially since the kid is only 2.\n\n- The mental load of being on call: OP mentioned wife is pregnant, which means wife will not be drinking during her night out \u2014 will she not then be the default emergency parent to be called if something urgent happened? I don\u2019t think OP even considered not drinking completely on his night out (he mentioned having only a few drinks, but not nothing). If I were his wife, I\u2019d be annoyed with the assumption that since I won\u2019t be drinking, OP then can still drink, knowing that if there is an emergency call from babysitter, one parent (the pregnant one) would definitely be sober.\n\n- The mental load of having to be the bad guy by going against OP\u2019s flawless logic that both of them can still go out. Like I said, OP\u2019s logic is techincally sound, so the burden of having to go against that logic will be on the wife & I wonder if she\u2019d be feeling guilty about saying no from an emotional place, because it makes her out to be the bad guy (the party pooper) for OP?\n\n- The mental load of relying on this babysitter too much (using the favour for separate nights out instead of date nights, which should be more important to OP than his friend\u2019s bday) & also for the perception that OP prefers to go out than taking care of daughter?\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s an outright asshole, even if I am also on the side of his wife. I appreciate him bringing this up for discussion if nothing else.",

Wife may be concerned that if they start this once, this will become a precedent.",

And in that case, *who* is going to be the parent expected to respond to the \"your kid is inconsolable and IDK what to do\" call? I think OP really needs to step up here and confirm beyond a doubt to wife that he's going to be the on-call parent and the one monitoring his phone/checking in and if he's not willing to do that, just stay home.\n\nLike, my niblings LOVE me (not to sound conceited lol). But no joke, they just took to me when they were babies and I'm the first adult they go to greet after Grandma. The very first time I babysat through bedtime, Nibling 1 (5) went right to bed after his routine (bathroom, tuck in, story). Nibling 2 (3) ... somehow only just then realized Auntie wasn't Mommy and it became A PROBLEM. He was distraught. I'd get him settled, he'd almost be asleep, and then he'd look at me and just start crying and calling for mom. And this was in his own home, in his own room, surrounded by his bedding and his plushies with his white noise machine and his big brother down the hall. He finally exhausted himself ... 10 minutes before his parents got home and woke up right away.\n\nIf Daughter has never fallen asleep in a new place without Mom and Dad, it may be rough and I can see OP's wife being worried that 1) it might be too much for the relative and 2) she'll be the one expected to end her night early to go over and pick up Daughter. That's a legitimate concern and one I feel OP isn't taking into account.",

I actually got really frustrated at him the other day, because I had a medical procedure that he needed to drive me to, daycare was closed, and he was desperately trying to find someone to watch our son. In my view, it was not a big deal to watch our child at the doctor's office (I would have done it if the situation was reversed). In his view, he absolutely wanted me to have someone watch our son during his medical procedure so I wouldn't have to watch him. We just view the whole situation differently. It's far more stressful for me to find a sitter than watch and entertain him in public.

      "content": "i think you're getting a lot of unfair flack OP, but my judgement is a very, very soft YTA. like, here's the thing \u2014 your description and explanation of everything is extremely logical. i read your post and spent so much time scrolling through all the comments completely unable to understand why everyone was attacking you and making assumptions. i genuinely could not comprehend how you could be in the wrong, given that neither of you would have to give up your night out and your daughter would be well taken care of. and if i were in your position, id absolutely want to go out and be completely stumped as to why so many thought i couldn't. but then i thought some more, and another commenter mentioned something about how this is about emotions, not logic, which was what helped me realize why you should stay home. lemme explain: \n\nyour wife doesn't just want to go out with her friends, she wants you to stay home with your daughter when she does. not as punishment, because you're always going out and she's always staying home with her. she wants you to stay home with her for three reasons, as far as i can tell: first, the one she told you about how this family member already does so much for you guys. i know that you asked them and they said they'd be happy to, i know you have a routine set up where you do this all the time, and i know that because of this it seems ridiculous to assume that you'd be putting this family member out by asking for their help one more night. but here's the thing: she was probably already worried that you guys rely on this family member too much, and now here's a situation where you don't *have* to rely on them, so to her it probably feels that much more egregious and entitled to *choose* to take advantage of their kindness just so that you can have a night out. so to her, this is not an isolated event that can be looked at in a vacuum, it's the straw that breaks the camels back. or rather, it's the iron pipe that you throw on top of all the straws. so, regardless of whether or not your family member is happy to take care of your daughter that night, it will still stress your wife out that you're asking them to, and she won't be able to enjoy her night out. that alone is enough of a reason for me to think you should stay home, but there's two more.\n\nthe second reason is that she wants YOU to stay home with your daughter. i know in other comments you said you spend a lot of time with her, i know you said you'd only have dinner and bedtime with her even if you did stay home, but i want you to look at it from your wife's perspective. she stays home alone with your daughter a lot more than you do. i'm sure that those nights alone with her entail the same dinner and bedtime, so not a whole lot of time on any given night. however, these nights add up. your daughter is spending more time with your wife than you, and as a result they are building a deeper connection/relationship. does your wife PERCEIVE herself to be the primary caregiver? emphasis on the perceive -- it's not about whether she *is* based off a logical breakdown of time/chores, it's about whether she *thinks* she is. and if she does -- why? further -- who does your DAUGHTER perceive to be her \"main parent\"? who does she go to when she's hurt, or has a question, or has a nightmare, or needs something? is it possible that the time/chores/stuff you do for your daughter/household is more practical and less emotional, and therefore does not build as deep of a bond with your daughter as the work your wife does? basically, i think your wife wants you to take this chance when you're alone with your daughter to build the same relationship with her that your wife has. she wants you and your daughter to have a closer relationship, for your daughter to know and rely on you as much as she does your wife. it's also possible she's tired of being the primary/main, and wants you to be equal parents. this night is just step one in that direction. \n\n(side note/observation: your wife might be looking at things in the long term/trends, while you seem to be looking at things in an isolated, individual way. keep that in mind for future disagreements).\n\nthe last reason, and imo the most important one, is that *she wants you to stay home.* it honestly doesn't really matter if it's logical, it doesn't really matter if you don't *need* to, it doesn't really matter if someone else can watch her and you can both have your night out. she's asking you to stay home, staying home would make her happy, you should do it. it's a small ask, and doesn't put you out too much. yeah it sucks you won't get to see your friends and celebrate their birthday, but if they mean that much to you then you should organize another night out for you to spend with them to make up for it. i know that just on principle it seems unreasonable, and you still might not Get It, and maybe you're even worried about slippery slopes and not wanting to entertain crazy demands just to make the wife happy. but ask yourself \u2014 does she always make unreasonable demands? is this a running theme? or is it that every so often she asks for something that you can't understand why, but it wouldn't be the hardest thing for you to do? because there are times where we can't really understand the reason why someone does something, but we can accept that they *do* and respond accordingly. your choice here is to use logic to deny your wife's feelings, or to accept that she feels the way she does and do what you can to make her happy. \n\nthat's why my judgment is YTA and not NAH. it's because while logically you *may* be right (and that's only if the first two reasons i offered were wrong), your wife is having emotions and the kind thing to do would be to acknowledge that and do what you can to help, even if it involves a bit of sacrifice. \n\n[this tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8rWTj8o/) about logic, emotions, and empathy is some good food for thought and informed a lot of my perspective. hope it helps :)",

Does your wife STILL only want to go out about 6x/yr? Now that you have a young child has it never occurred to you that being out of the house that many nights a week has become a problem for your wife? And then, on one of the infrequent times she has a night out, you STILL couldn\u2019t modify your desires to take care of your child. It doesn\u2019t matter that you made the arrangements you did. It\u2019s the fact that you have no desire to voluntarily spend time CARING (not covering) for your daughter on your own while your wife enjoys a night out- something you do all the time. I mean if you really go out 3x a week that means you spend 156 evenings a year out with your friends. And if your wife only goes out 6x/year that means she\u2019s with your daughter 359 nights out of the year to your 209. (Excluding sleepovers and if we\u2019re just talking your availability to your family during regular days) Does this seem fair to you? And then, on one night where she wants to be able to go out, you still refuse to care for your daughter and arrange a sleepover instead. No wonder she\u2019s upset. And let\u2019s be clear- taking care of your child as its parent should never feel like you are being punished. If it does that is an indication that your priorities are not straight and you should look into that. Now that you\u2019re a father, your focus should be on your family not gaming. And I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t go out. But you might need to rethink the frequency.",

Yes, both parents get to go out, but the wife is clearly not comfortable with asking the aunt to pick up more child care hours. Aunt already gives a lot of time to watch the kids (and I take OP at their word that aunt enjoys this time, and was happy to watch their daughter this time as well), but baby #2 is on the way. \n\nThe aunt is soon going to transition from watching one kid for a few hours thrice a week (and a kid that seems well behaved based on OP's confidence that she sleeps through the night and that once bedtime happens the night is over) to watching 2 kids. 2 kids vs one is usually more than doubling the amount of energy required, and there's a real risk that the baby will be significantly more hands on than current daughter.\n\nThis arrangement needs to last for *years*. Aunt watches kids when neither parent can due to work, and that's not likely to change. So this aunt is a massively important resource that will enable their life style for probably the next 4-5 years at a minimum.  If the aunt ever winds up not wanting to spend her time watching kids, it's going to take significant sacrifices to replace her. \n\nThe wife clearly feels bothered about asking the aunt to do more. We don't know why that is, could be she's worried aunt will change their mind down the line, could be she doesn't think the aunt enjoys it as much as she professes, it could be she's completely misreading the situation and the aunt is happy to watch now and forever and that source of familial good will will never be overtapped. \n\nRegardless, the wife clearly has concerns over how much the aunt is helping, and a solution that doesn't address those concerns isn't a solution where everyone wins. It's possible the wife's concerns are unfounded and she's asking OP to stay home when it wouldn't be a problem that he goes out, but it's also possible the concerns have basis and they risk losing a critical resource of their current life style, or at least souring the wife's relationship with somebody OP described as \"like her second mom\". The wife's concerns over how much they're asking of their aunt need to be addressed before the solution is actually one where everybody wins.",

Hell, they just had him for a full week so we could take our honeymoon (he is almost 2).

If there\u2019s a short time lapse where one of us is still at work, we call my in-laws to take him for an hour or so MAX. There is no calling a babysitter so we can see our friends weekly, or so I can attend a party while my husband sees friends. It\u2019s one of us *sacrificing* for the other.",
