  "post content": "So my wife (34f) forgets her ID and I (33m) order a drink at a restaurant we frequent often. Obviously they wouldn\u2019t serve my wife a drink because she couldn\u2019t present an ID. We could be considered regulars with how often we are there. Regularly spend $150-200 a night and tip 20-30%. The people working tonight are not the regular staff. My wife has maybe 3 discreet sips of my drink (not in front of the server) and I want to order another drink. The server refuses to give me another drink because he says we are sharing drinks and watching our table like we are little kids. Mind you the whole time he sets up people in the restaurant to police us and watch our table when he can\u2019t. Barely gives any service. Except when we\u2019re done with our food. I have no problem with them not serving my wife because yes the law says no drinks if you don\u2019t have ID, but you deny me a grown 33 year old man with a wedding ring on a second drink. Even if the liquor board is there they check to make sure people who are drinking are ID\u2019ed. They\u2019re not going to make a fuss if someone has a sip who is obviously over 21. None of your business what happens at our table. You\u2019re not top flight security. Left a $0 tip. AITA?",

That's literally what they do. That, and trying it themselves. Then the business has their license revoked, has to pay thousands of dollars in fines, as does the individual that served or allowed someone to drink another's alcohol. My store wouldve kicked you both out as per policy just to cover their asses.\n\nEvery business is allowed to make their own rules on TOP of whatever is required by law in that state, so long as it doesn't go against said law. \n\nYTA, OP. If you wanna whine about how much of an *aDuLt* you and your wife are, act like adults and remember to carry your ID. Which is also a requirement of adults, though I can't remember if that's just my state or a federal law. All persons are required to carry proof of their identity, even if (say for young teenagers that can't have a license yet) that's a SS card, or non-driver state ID.
