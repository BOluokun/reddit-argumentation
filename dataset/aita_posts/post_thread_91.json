  "post content": "TA since fam has main\nSo, me and wife have a new born, who is breastfed. \n\nMy wife *hates* confrontation, she never stands up for herself ,She won\u2019t argue with anyone\u2026..*ever* I mean ever. She will let you walk all over her and then apologize to you\n\nIt used to be infuriating because she\u2019s the sweetest soul and she just lets people say what they want and she doesn\u2019t deserve it but after talking there is a good reason behind it so we are working together how to fix this. \n\nWell one thing she always felt afraid, not because she didn\u2019t want to but she knew it caused confrontation was breastfeeding anywhere but the house or in a bathroom or closet and we will keep a blanket.\n\nIt took a lot of explaining but unless she is uncomfortable with breast feeding out, there is no reason to hide in a bathroom. \n\nWell, we are at my mothers house,I don\u2019t have the best relationship with her but my wife thinks it\u2019s important and i enjoy talking to my dad So we were over with the baby chatting with my father and my mother cooking as they were talking she started feeding. \n\nBaby was eating and she blanket covering her slightly. dad has six kids he couldn\u2019t give less of a sh*t, he looked away for a moment so she could get situated and engaged back in conversation without any issue. \n\nmy mother comes in, gasps and goes on a rant. She said that that is disgusting and if she was to do that she should\u2019ve gone home, especially infront of her husband, who apparently \u201clooks uncomfortable\u201d and it\u2019s rude to do when you know people around you don\u2019t like it. Dad cut her off saying to keep him out of it and feeding a baby wasn\u2019t his issue. She ignored, continued ranting saying that she needed to respect herself more and don\u2019t ever do that in her house again. \n\nI stopped her, I said that she needed to get lost and get over herself she had six kids who she undoubtedly did the same thing with and this was just her way of taking her anger out but she\u2019s not going to do it on her. I said that she was being a hypocritical a hole and that this is the last time she\u2019s seeing wife or baby. This happened once and not going to happen again. \n\n*then* she said she was just in a bad mood and she\u2019s so sorry she took it out on her and she\u2019s welcomed to do that whenever she needs to.\n\nI told her she shoulda thought about that before. Then went to my wife who mid rant left to the bathroom in hysterics but didn\u2019t want to interrupt the babies eating. We sat in the bathroom for a little while until baby was done, she stopped crying.\nWe left, my dad said I was being more reasonable than he would have, mom sent me tons of messages, family is telling me I was being dramatic and that it wasn\u2019t that serious and I was being entirely unreasonable and if my wife was that hurt by it she needed to grow \u2018thicker skin\u2019\n\nShe didn\u2019t even *actually* have an issue, she was just being mean. I think I was right to do what I did. \n\nBut AITA?",

But only lady nipples. Not men. Guy nipples are just... meh. Nobody ever considers those to be inappropriate or sexual.\n\nIt's pretty stupid and misogynistic, but most folks are so used to it we don't think about it. There are loads of \"Christian\" men who act all disgusted by breastfeeding because they basically think boobs should only exist for thier viewing pleasure, and nothing else. These are the ones who call breastfeeding mothers \"lewd\" in public. They don't even like thier wives to breastfeed oftentimes- I guess it ruins things for them, so they just do all they can to pretend it isn't happening and making them hide away to feed baby.\n\nBecause it's a societal issue though, that means plenty of women have internalized misogyny, too, so they can be awful towards other women.\n\nSo tired of the puritanical beliefs that far too many Americans have.
