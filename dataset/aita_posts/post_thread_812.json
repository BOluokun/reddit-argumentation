  "post content": "I (20M) am a college student. Recently, we had a group presentation to do, which our group has a whole really fucked up. One of our team members is this girl with whom I don\u2019t really get along. We often get into disagreements and don\u2019t quite enjoy each other\u2019s presence.\n\nShe chose to personally attack and blame me specifically for our poor performance as a group. She went on saying \u201cit\u2019s all your fault that the presentation sucked, I am gonna email and tell them that you\u2019re not a part of our group\u2026\u201d etc. I argued back and brought up my own argument in regard to how this was a fuck up from all of our side and what she did (literally stole an entire presentation from the internet for our pitch).\n\nThis was when she was clearly fuming, and retaliates with \u201cis this how your dad yells at your mom?\u201d out of the blue. Keep in mind that there\u2019s no context to this at all, but I do know that her dad took off and left her family when she was a child. Neither did I yell at her, I merely just raised my voice to some extent. She randomly brought up my family into a personal argument, and I lost it at this point. I replied \u201cOh, so you\u2019re gonna bring in my family into this argument? Go fuck yourself, you fucking bitch\u201d\n\nNow she\u2019s going around trash talking me and telling people that I called her a bitch (I don\u2019t really care) but I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Am I the asshole for calling her a bitch?",
