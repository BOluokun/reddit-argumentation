  "post content": "I (33F) have been with my boyfriend (46M) for almost 3 years. He moved in with me about 6 months after we started dating. Things were going quite well. He does not work, as he is a disabled veteran and collects a pension. I work a decently paying job and make about $60k more per year than he does. He would give me a few hundred dollars here and there towards food/bills when I would ask and I paid my mortgage and the rest of the bills. He was paying about $1200/month in child support for his 3 girls who lived with their mom, now 15F, 17F and 18F.  I have 2 girls, now 10F and 13F, who live with me 60% of the time and live with their Dad the rest of the time. \n\nAbout 6 months ago his girls' mom decided she couldn't take care of them any longer. She had ruined their family home (no running water, septic was destroyed, holes in the floor, 5 gallon buckets used as toilets, etc). It was awful to discover, and at no point when the girls visited did they share this info with me. I don't know HOW he didn't know what was happening but he says he didn't.\n\nAt that time, the courts decided the girls needed to live with their father, who lives with me obvs. I knew this would be a tough transition for all involved, so for the last 6 months I've continued to pay for everything and he's given me $500/month towards their support (food, bills, etc). Their mother has contributed nothing. Upon discovering that I was getting a bit behind with finances, I itemized my spending and determined that my costs have gone up about $1700/month since they came here, just regular bills, which doesnt include Christmas presents, clothes, salon trips, vacations, going out to eat, etc that I have also paid for.\n\nI showed this to my boyfriend and asked that he started paying me an amount closer to the cost of the spending, at least the $1200 he was paying in child support before they came here.  He became very angry, accusing me of being money hungry and insinuating he was taking advantage of me. Then he told me he would give me $750/month towards bills. I expressed that if he felt he could support 4 people for less than what I was asking him to contribute on his own, then he should do that. He says I should be OK because it's \"for our family.\"\n\nI feel like I am being taken advantage of, and what makes this feel worse is that I discovered my boyfriend's ex wife also was dating a younger person with a good job, and that guy is now suing her for taking advantage of him. It almost hits too close to home, but I do love my boyfriend, and his daughters, and I feel like if he should contribute more to the support of his kids when I am paying the bulk of our expenses. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: He did give me the $1200 I asked for. He will pay at the beginning of every month. I told him I would let him know if I needed more, and he said he understood. I also want to clarify, I do have a very good income. I did not sacrifice my children's college savings, my retirement accounts, my investment accounts, or my mortgage. I wasn't able to contribute to my savings account and I was willing to sacrifice that for a time, but I was over it when I calculated the added cost of everything. We've had some hard conversations lately, but it's been working itself out slowly and I want to thank everyone who contributed with advice and support.",
