  "post content": "Last Thursday, my girlfriend went to a doctor's appointment, and he mentioned her weight and all of the issues that come with being 122kg/270 pounds. She initially took it as the doctor insulting her and decided he was a fataphobic \" quack\" and that she's not going to follow his advice. That's what I got told Thursday afternoon over the phone. Thursday night I get a call from her about people being judgmental.\n\nTo make a long story short, she's spent, since Thursday, holed up in her apartment, binging. She's doing this I'll-Show-You to the doctor, that's my interpretation. I know she's binging because I can see on my phone where she goes. Grocery store, fast food place, fast food, fast food. She canceled date night as well. This morning, I sent her a text saying that I loved her, and that this current situation is worrying me. I told her that, while again I do love her & I'm not here to police her body, she needs to stop lying to herself and acting like the Dr. had some pre-planned plot to make her feel bad. I told her it's time to be honest with herself and about her weight. She texted back that I'm being unkind & judgmental.\n\nAITA?",

But if your gf is 270 pounds and apparently revenge-eating trash food, she may have some serious psychological problems and needs to, for her own health, change her relationship with food.  Assisting her will be really difficult but love and kindness will help.  Good luck to both of you.",

OP, you need to actually talk to her about her feelings regarding the doctor, her body, etc. and treat her like an expert on her experiences without shame involved. Trying to do \"tough love\" regarding her health is is really not going to be effective because 1) she lives in her body all the time and is constantly reminded about it 2) it just builds more shame around it for her and she will feel less comfortable even approaching it.",

As someone who had a severe ED, she is going to be very defensive and to truly get over it, needs to think you're on her side. Obviously that doesn't mean encourage her or even be okay with it but she needs unconditional support rather than attacks. Just like she's doing an \"I'll show you\" because of her doctor, it's going to be easy to trigger that with criticism. \n\nJust based on what worked with me or what I would have wanted, I'd let her know you're absolutely not judging her and that you're open to talk if she ever wants to vent or needs support, and you will not criticize or judge what she tells you. That you care for her and if she wants or needs anything (idk, I always wanted to explain the negative thoughts and the reasons I had them but I didn't have good support) to let you know. I'm not aware of your diet, nor am I saying you need to change for her, but depending on circumstances you could offer to make dinners for a bit or whatever you feel comfortable with accomodating (taking over the shopping, temporarily taking out her number one trigger food out of the house, going on walks together, etc). Try to make passive statements; an example is instead of saying she needs to stop lying to herself and taking the doctors words as an insult, you could ask what part of the doctors statement did she feel wasn't appropriate, and better understand her that way. \n\nEDs have a lot of psychological aspects, and is very similar to addiction with the mindset. Just like an addict has to want to help themselves, it's the same with an ED. And that isn't placing blame or anything, just saying that the best way to successfully recover is to want to recover, which usually needs a good support system.",

She asks me sometimes to portion out cookies or cereal and hide it so she can have one portion without triggering a binge. I always leave little notes in the bag or container to show support.\n\nBoth of us refuse to engage if the other is in self harm talk or exhibiting destructive behaviours like when she used to purge. I would go out and come back and then we\u2019d snuggle or watch a show but I was not comfortable being around purging. She is not comfortable when I cook huge amounts to feed everyone but eat none of it as is a very anorexic trait. But it is pointless me taking the binge food out of her hands in the same way pouring out vodka doesn\u2019t stop alcoholism. We both have to do therapy, recovery and put the effort in ourselves at heart. Support is just that. We have to self soothe first. And both of us have to pay for therapy privately as it is not available otherwise nor is the dietitian etc. We both have health issues directly caused by the eating disorder and we also have to manage those ourselves. We support each other but I am not making her lunch or doctor\u2019s appts to sort a condition caused by her ED any more than she is doing the emotional labour for me. \n\nWe both had EDs before we met and so we can be a team but my anorexia recovery is as much mine to work on as my other disabilities. It is co dependent to have a partner or parent as an adult take all that on and no different to other active addicts. The fact Reddit can see partners should seek advice from orgs like Al Anon if with an alcohol or other addict but insists they must do it with food addiction or eating disorders is toxic. This enables the person with the ED and makes both miserable. It is on the addict and if it is not possible to have a healthy recovery dynamic then it is better to break up.\n\nMy GF and I have the understanding that should one of us relapse into refusing to address an ED then the relationship cannot continue. Same as if someone prioritises any addiction over partnership. You cannot stay in the hope they will see the light if they keep closing the door in your face. An ex BF broke up with me at my worst anorexic point for my refusal to accept it and do anything except get worse. I thought for years he was an AH for abandoning me when sick but with some distance I realise why he did to protect himself and that he was right because anorexia was not my fault but it was my responsibility. \n\nMy anorexia is linked to a lot of medical trauma in childhood and nearly every health issue I have is written off as my weight or my ED. And at times my weight was why I was that sick. At other times it was short sighted medical care and nearly killed me when serious things requiring emergency surgery were ignored because \u2018anorexics are attention seekers.\u2019 I am 43 and still having this medical trauma now to the extent I almost died in the pandemic when being thin meant doctors ignored appendicitis leading to sepsis and a collapsed lung. \n\nAll women in my experience get medical misogyny. At some point you have to self advocate to challenge it and you have to admit when they are telling you uncomfortable truths. I knew if I did not try to address my ED in my mid thirties I would likely not live to see 40 and while it hurt to have a doctor tell me that, medical truths hurt. It hurts to hear you have cancer. It hurt to hear I had sepsis and might die. Feelings cannot always be protected in medicine if you want to live. Life and death are blunt.\n\nNTA.",

Your GF doesn\u2019t need to focus on her body weight. She should be focusing on her eating habits. The two can be related but often aren\u2019t. \n\n2. You can\u2019t change her habits. You can only control yourself. Staying with someone and watching them self harm is an incredibly painful thing. You might need to get therapy. You can\u2019t make her be healthy. \n\n3. You can\u2019t control anything but your own actions. Be prepared to walk away. Make sure you emphasize you don\u2019t care about her body\u2019s shape or size. She is going to say you are leaving \u201cBecause she\u2019s fat.\u201d But that\u2019s not true. You care about her health. You can\u2019t watch her make herself sick for the next 50 years. \n\nTry to phrase it like that. She\u2019s sick and needs help. Therapy and a nutritionist. You can\u2019t just ignore her having a chronic illness and refusing to get treatment. \n\nHope this POV helps.",
