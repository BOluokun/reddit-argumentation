  "post content": "I (15F) am in high school and got dress coded by my teacher during history class. The dress code at my school is usually not so enforced. It was also a pretty hot day so I wore a pair of shorts. The rule at my school is that our fingertips have to go past the length of our pants otherwise it\u2019s out of dress code. Well, today, I got up to turn in an assignment and my teacher noticed that I was wearing shorts. He told me to hold my arms down to my shorts and then basically announced to the whole class that my pants were too short. I don\u2019t think anyone even noticed what I was wearing until he pointed it out. My fingers went past the hem of my pants by 3 centimeters. It\u2019s not like I had anything hanging out. The shorts were jean shorts that had no holes in it and were pretty modest as it went halfway down my thighs. There were at least 3 other guys in class wearing tank tops and sandals which were also against the rules but the teacher didn\u2019t seem to notice. He told me to go to the office and call my mom for a change of clothes. \n\nThis was at the beginning of class and we have a final coming up soon. Today was supposed to be a big review lesson and I didn\u2019t want to miss it. I\u2019ve also never been sent to the office before so I was really upset. I just found it ironic that we were learning about gender biases literally yesterday, yet I was being removed from class for being a \u201cdistraction\u201d to the men in the room. So I said no. I understood that I violated the dress code but seeing as it was the first time it happened, it didn\u2019t seem fair to remove me from class during such an important lesson. It was also felt really objectifying to be shamed for my clothing choices. The teacher and I had a bit of an argument that went on for a couple of minutes, and it delayed the class. The teacher and some of my classmates are mad that I didn\u2019t just go to the office. \n\nAita?",

Plus she had a suit jacket, which she had taken off because it was very hot.

We we're already at school when we knew) My art teacher hated someone in my class who had a wish to transition we all called him by his new name. She however kept calling him by his deadname because his parents couldn't accept that he wanted to be a boy. He started his transition from the moment he was 18. One day he was wearing jeans shorts that we're maybe a little too short for the rules (not for the men's underwear rule). Mine we're around the same length and also a little too short. I think someone else as well. She singled him out because she hated him and/or didn't notice us. When she wanted to punish him I stood up and said to punish me too then but she didn't wanted to do that. After a big discussing with the whole class she didn't punish anyone.

She then proceeded to show him where her own fingertips reached--she's petite with stubby arms, so she could have had most of her ass hanging out and still not broken the rule. The rule ended up being changed to \"shorts must not be more than X inches above the knee,\" but I still never wore shorts to that school again because I was afraid of being yelled at by a teacher again.\n\nNTA, but if you want to change the rule, be smart about it. Get a bunch of girls in your school to measure what length of shorts they could wear--I guarantee you it's a huge range, because everyone's arms and hands aren't proportionate--and make a graph of it. Make another graph of how long the shorts being sold in stores in your area actually are. Present your findings to the school board with as many other girls and parents as you can get to come with you and demand that the rule either be stricken entirely (preferred) or changed to a fair, blanket rule about inseam length (compromise). You're 100% right to make a big stink about it, but if you want to be effective, start strategizing!",

One classmate had a tattoo, I know multiple people who had earrings or piercings. Nobody gave a shit really, the general attitude was that it's up to the parent what they consider to be appropriate, and if the parent is okay with the kid getting a piecing, or showing up in hot pants, so be it.",
