  "post content": "Ok, so my brother (28) got engaged to his fiancee (26) about 6 months ago, they are expecting in June, and they just bought a residential lot with two houses on it. My brother Shay's said he never wanted kids, but once they got engaged he said he now wants 2. They found out they were expecting after 3 months of just no birth control, not really trying. Their property came fully furnished with brand new items like a King sized bed and leather lay-z-boy furniture, and a Jacuzzi!\n\nI am actually super happy for him that he has his shit together, isn't falling down the alcohol/drug hole that we were worried about happening, and seems to be genuinely happy. I would never wish for him to not have the amazing things in his life.\n\nMy life...is not in the best place right now. My DH (30) and I (30) had to sell my house and move in with my parents 4 years ago when we both lost our jobs due to the economy (1.5hrs from the city). We have our own area in the basement. \n2 years ago we gave birth to DD after struggling for 3.5 years to conceive!\nIn the last year DH has had 5 different jobs. DH now has a job in the city (2 months), and I work between three different communities (one in the city; 1 year). When we're working in the city we stay at the In-Laws place 20min outside the city. I sleep with DD on the 2nd floor across from MIL and FIL, husband sleeps in the basement with SIL (33) and BIL (29).  \nEven though both DH and I are employed now (I'm casual right now, trying to get full-time permanent) we have such a debt load ($2000+/mnth) that it would be impossible for us to move out for another 4 years. \nWe've been living pay cheque to pay cheque for 4 years now, but I am trying to figure out a financial plan that will help us move into our own place in about 4 years while putting money away for DD's future.\n\nMy mom has been telling me all these fantastic things going on in my brother's life, and while I am super excited for him, I am also sad that I feel like I'm drowning. My mom wanted to celebrate Christmas at his new house, meanwhile I had to scratch to try and get my daughter birthday/Christmas prrsents. So I asked my mom if she could try not to talk to me about it so much as I am trying to work through my issues. I reassured her that I am happy and excited for him, just really sad for me, but working through it.\n\nMy mom said she is disappointed in me not being able to just be happy for my brother. I won't go into the other points of the conversation, as I really just want to know: AITA?\n\nSorry if it sounds like I'm trying to justify myself, I'm just trying to give an idea of the situation and my personal thought processes.\n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for commenting today. I finally got through all the posts that were here. I'm sorry if I didn't comment back, but sometimes I didn't have anything I felt needed to be said. Apologies if anyone took offense to anything I said in my post or my comments, nothing I wrote was said in anger.",

It sounds like you and your husband are both making strides with your new jobs, so hopefully this will lead to bigger and better things.\n\nThis time next year your whole life could look completely different, so try not to lose hope or be too down on yourself :)",

We also don't know if they didn't talk to mom and dad about if they'd be ok with them trying given the circumstances and mom and dad said \"absolutely, the more the merrier\". As well, she's living at home to try to be financially responsible, but that doesn't mean that they couldn't move out somewhere less than ideal but that would still work if they absolutely had to. We don't know any of these specifics because that's not what she came here to discuss, and these types of posts always bring out the \"holier than thou I would never be so irresponsible\" types that seem to think they understand every single nuance from a 3000 character post that go into making that type of life altering decision. We don't have anywhere near enough info to judge, and if you've never been in that situation with infertility (I'm not saying you haven't, just that lots of people with that mind set have not) then you cannot possibly understand the decision being made.
