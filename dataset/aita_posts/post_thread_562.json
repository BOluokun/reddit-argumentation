  "post content": "I'm a 13 year old girl and have played violin for around 7 years and am in my middle schools more experienced orchestra, I guess. I really don't want to sound overly confident or brag here, I'm just using the information so that maybe I'm not as much of an asshole as if I were to stay for a smaller level performance, know what I mean?\n\nOur family had planned a trip this October to visit my grandparents, for unfortunately what may be the last time. This trip just so happens to be planned the same day as the concert (they were unaware of this). I feel more disappointed than should be. I can't even understand myself on why I would want to postpone my trip in order to play for a middle school orchestra concert. I also found out this was the same day we take a group photo. I know, another terrible reason for me to stay. And no, I'm not saying \"I have to stay, or else my gorgeous talented self won't be in the group photo!\" It just makes me seriously happy to be there and play. Nobody has to notice me, I don't have to be first chair, I just enjoy it. I also acknowledge that it should make me much happier to be with my grandparents, and it does. It's extremely difficult to explain what I'm thinking at the moment. I myself am not completely sure why I seem to be obsessed with being at the concert.\n\nMy grandparents will be disappointed and my parents are too. I didn't think about that before being annoying, which is selfish.\n\nAfter being a selfish idiot for a few days, my mom scheduled my ticket for two days after the performance and my other relative who lives near us can take me to the airport. I'm not proud of this. I just need reassurance that I am in fact an a-hole.\n\nAm I being silly... AITA?!",

I played first flute in the town concert wind band from 15 - 17. It was a huge deal to me. However, it\u2019s one concert, there will be others, you only get two sets of grandparents, once they\u2019re gone you\u2019ll miss them like crazy.",

(Maybe take your violin?)\n\nI think it\u2019s important to keep doing the things that are an important part of your life.  To me, the photograph sounds like it\u2019s more important than the actual performance.  But this is a part of what you\u2019ve been working hard for, and I think your parents are just dismissive of it.\n\nIf they really give you a hard time about it, you have a great comeback:  \u201cif it\u2019s so important, then why are we only going for X days instead of X+2 or X+7?  Why only X?\u201d\n\nThe answer, which they will never admit, is that they recognize that life goes on, and X is an arbitrary number that is convenient for them, not everybody else.  There is zero reason to insist you go for the same length of time.",
