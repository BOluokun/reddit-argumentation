  "post content": "So im not any good at this but I want to know. So back in December I was finacially struggling as my job was giving me little to no hours. At that time I was dating a female and I decided to go and look at potential gifts for her and my friend tagged along. We get sucked into the perfume section of store and start looking at perfume. I told my friend that he didnt have to buy it and I could get her something else that was within my budget, but he insisted on buying it. Even after he bought it I told him if he wanted to return it id be perfectly okay with that. Me and the girl broke up and he has lost his job, since then he has been pestering me about paying him back even though, there have been countless times I have bought things for him and havent asked him for a cent back. I just want to know whether im being an asshole/too nice if i refuse to pay him $200 when he has cost me atleast a solid $10000 by buying him Vinyls, paying for Ubers to get us from A to B, etc etc. I try to be good friend and help when they are in need but idk.",

He\u2019s an asshole for not considering you paid alot for him in the past. \n\nAlso, \u201cfemale\u201d?",

IDK, I'm a woman too, and I don't get it.  It's also why you hear the word \"women\" being used as an adjective more now.  For me, I've always known it as a noun, so hearing \"women scientists,\" and \"women athletes\" etc is jarring.",

It depends on how it\u2019s actually used. People can still be offensive but use the word woman.",
