  "post content": "Throwaway as I have friends on reddit. \n\nI (34f) have two boys (10m and 8m) and my husband \"Dirk\" (40m) has a daughter from another relationship \"Gwen\" (just turned 6f). We are a healthful household and we teach moderation and controlling how much we take when we have treats. We are also very active and every day strive to get the boys moving.\n\nHowever, Gwen is only here two weekends a month, and her mother has the exact opposite attitude. In all honesty that woman's blood type is probably ketchup. Similarly, Gwen is about 20lb heavier than a 5 year old girl is supposed to be.\n\nIt makes me sad for this child and her health so when we get her I try to teach Gwen about healthy eating and moving around. We have the boys play with her so she's getting active, and we make a distinction between foods that are healthy and ones that aren't. When I see one of the kids reaching for a \"treat\" food in the pantry I'll ask \"would you like to make a healthier choice?\" And Gwen is really getting it, she's always going for better choices now and is also asking for fruit at home which is really good.\n\nGwen's birthday ended up falling on one of her weekends with us, and while we were talking about what kind of cake to have, I asked Gwen about the healthier choice. My reasoning is unfortunately she's still getting all that garbage at home, and it's just not good for a growing girl. She agreed and we decided to have some low fat ice cream so she can still have a sweet treat. It's a brand Gwen loves and asks for every time she's here, so she was happy with it.\n\nUntil the next day after she went back to mom. Her mom called us furious, she said then when Gwen got home and she asked about her birthday with us and her cake, Gwen started crying because she really did want cake but didn't want to \"make a bad choice\". She accused me of fat shaming her and her daughter and that I owe her a cake and a big apology.\n\nI'm just looking out for the health of a child in my care, but I never said Gwen couldn't have cake and she could have had one if she said she wanted one. I suggested sticking to ice cream because I care. But did I go about it in a TA way?",

A person\u2019s weight and body size/shape is not a reliable indicator of their overall health. People in larger bodies can be very healthy and people in smaller bodies can be very unhealthy. \n\n2. Even if this really is about health and not about weight shaming, health is not a moral imperative. Nobody owes you their good health, and a person does not commit an immoral act by not being as \u201chealthy\u201d as you would like them to be. \n\n3. Food is morally neutral. There are no good foods or bad foods.\n\n4. Mental health is as important as physical health. The two are intertwined and frequently impact each other. In a lot of families, parents focus on their children\u2019s physical health at the expense of their mental health. This is what you are doing every time you stop Gwen from having a treat and \u201casking\u201d her to choose something healthier. You are teaching her that she is wrong and bad to want the things she wants. You are teaching her that the way her body looks is more important that the way she feels, either physically or emotionally. \n\n5. Boys can also get eating disorders. Google \u201cChristopher Eccleston anorexia\u201d for an example of a man who struggles with his relationship with food and with his own body. Gwen is not the only person at risk of developing an eating disorder in this family.\n\nYTA, in the extreme.",

Being overweight at her age is not ideal at all but you're not her primary parent and you need to take this as a wake up call that she's not internalizing your healthful lifestyle, she is seeking your approval even when she is distraught about doing it. Low fat foods are terrible alternatives because they have sugar to replace the flavor fat would add, so you're not making much better choices.",
