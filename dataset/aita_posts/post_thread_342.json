  "post content": "So I (34f) gave birth on Christmas Day before my sons birth and to lessen visits. We (my husband 28m) made a list in October and sent it out to everyone \n\nSome rules include \n-up to date on ALL vaccines \n-if you feel anyway sick don\u2019t visit \n- let us know a week before hand so we can arrange a day/time\n- no smokers \n- no phone calls or visits between 7:30pm-10pm \n-you can only stay an hour \n-no picking up the baby without consent \n-no Adivce \n-no perfume/deodorant \n- no is no we won\u2019t explain why \n- no pictures to be taken or posted on social media \n- if you visit the first time you will be expected to give mom (me) a gift card and a gift for baby from out approved list\n- before you ever come no matter how many times you will be give a list of a ether food or groceries to bring with you AND a chore for a list of your choosing \n- no more than two visits a week per person \n\nIt\u2019s help to keep the visits to minimum and no one can complain about favouritism because everyone is treated equally. \nWhich brings me onto my current situation my sister in law(20f)  studies in a different part of the country and is rarely home asked to visit last week before she had to go back to school, so We set up a date with link to our gift list than sent her the takeout we\u2019d like including the chores she can choose from \n\nSent immediately texted back saying she\u2019s broke and can she do extra chores instead,\nMe and my husband talked about it and came to the decision that if we bent the rules for one person everyone would want the same treatment \n\nWe told her no that we were very clear about our rules and maybe next time she could visit. She begged even said would clean the whole house because it would be June before she\u2019s would be home again and we simply texted no. She didn\u2019t reply \n\nShe left this morning and we got multiple texts for my in laws belittling us for using our child as a cash grab, my husband simply replied it was our rules and no one deserves special treatment than told his family they were on a time out and blocked them\n\nSince than my family and our friends have told us we were wrong because she is a broke collage student and they would have understood if we looked the other way once. We have tried reaching out to his sister but she won\u2019t reply",

Gifts - for the baby and *especially* the mother - are something guests should bring as they want and on their own terms. Not as a mandate.\n\n2. She's in college. She's broke. She's willing to do extra labor to see her nibling. What more do you want? **You don't want to maintain the rules, you want money.** And your house cleaned.\n\n3.

I had people do the same for me when my kids were born, its a lovely way to show support and to feel supported.\n\nBut a *chore list* for every visitor?? Are you absolutely out of your mind?? You need to understand that, while its technically customary in most cultures to offer help to new parents around the house, your house is still *your* responsibility, and if friends and family choose to help you out in this way you should damn well be *grateful*, because not everyone is so lucky. To think you get to sit here and make demands like this of your family and friends is disgusting when there are countless parents across the world doing it all themselves every single day. Be thankful you aren't in their position.\n\nThe same goes for the gifts. Again, typically gifts for a newborn are customary in a lot of places, but to *demand* one as a prerequisite to visits?? And for yourself too?? Once again, be thankful you get anything at all. Something tells me that, if your family is happy to stand for this and bow to these ridiculous demands, they're probably pretty used to being held hostage to this high maintenance, transactional attitude of yours. \"Oh you wanna see my baby? That'll be 2 brand name onesies, the most expensive diapers, a $30 starbucks gift card for mum and 3 hours of your time and labour please.\"\n\nThe entitlement on you is gross.
