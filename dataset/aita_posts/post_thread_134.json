  "post content": "My fianc\u00e9 male 33, and I female 34 have been together for 5 going on 6 years, I was there for him for his drug addiction and raised his daughter while he was in jail and homeless and in rehab. I have a son from a previous relationship (15 male), and we have a son together (2 male).\n\nThis last weekend was his daughter's 13th birthday and the day before he messaged me to say that his daughter doesn't want my son at her birthday because her boyfriend is coming, my son and her boyfriend get along very well, and she feels like she will be left out.\n\nSo, I messaged my fianc\u00e9 and said I would stop by and give her, her gift but I'm not staying as my son was excited about seeing his sister on her birthday and he was sad that he wasn't invited anymore. My fianc\u00e9 then got angry that I was making a huge deal out of it saying she's allowed to have whoever she wants at her birthday, which I agree she has every right, just as I have every right to show up because my son was upset about being uninvited, he knows I will always have his back.\n\nHis mom called me to find out what was happening, and I told her what he had said, she told me that his daughter never said that she didn't want her brother there and that we must come, but I said no because my son was upset. I did not tell my son that my fianc\u00e9 was the person who uninvited him, but he figured it out and asked me if it was my fianc\u00e9, not his sister who didn't want him around.\n\nI ended up taking my son to the movies and the arcade but when he saw his sister at the mall, he decided he didn't want to stay any longer and we left.\n\nAm I the A\\*\\*hole for being upset about this whole situation?\n\nUpdate.\n\nSorry its taken so long for an update. I spoke with my stepdaughter and she told me that it was not her choice for my son to not be invited, it was his choice to disinvite my son. I understand him wanting to make sure his daughter has a good time but my son and her boyfriend are both older children a simple conversation would have saved all of this.\n\nShe believed I was angry with her and that's why I didn't come, I explained to her that I wasn't angry with her and that I will always be there for her.\n\nFor all those asking, I have no idea why he wanted to disinviite my son. We had been planning the day before and everything was fine, no mention of anything until the message saying he didn't want my son to come.",

Why did your fiance want to exclude your son and get mad when you had his back? These are questions that I would need my fiance to answer to my face. Then I would seriously consider if I wanted a relationship with a man like that. From reading the first paragraph alone it sounds like you are completely done with this man to begin with and that this episode was your witts end. It is easier to end an engagement than it is to end a marriage. I am proud that you had your sons back. It seems like your fiance has growing up to do.",
