  "post content": "brand new account and throwaway for you guys. \n\nSo Tuesday of last week I made my now ex-boyfriend dinner. He's a paleo junkie and I really wanted to impress him so I skipped class to slice fennel with a razor blade in order to garnish the strip steak I made for him. Yeah I really, really (really) loved him. I decided it would be easier to cook the steak in his kitchen so I went over to his place early (I have a code and open invite). I walked in to find half eaten Dominoes pizza on the counter (remember I sliced fennel with a razor blade because he's so \"dedicated\" to paleo) and noises coming from the bedroom. \n\nI walked in and he was absolutely plowing a good looking girl with a spectacular body. Fuck me for not eating pizza to impress him. I stood there in shock. She saw me over his shoulder first and started tapping furiously for him to get off. He turned around and hit me with the oh so classic \"this isn't what it looks like!\" \n\nI was speechless and had no idea what to do but I saw her clothes hanging over his desk chair. Because apparently I'm a petty b!tch, the only thing I could think was I wanted her to have leave his apartment without pants. I don't know, it made sense at the time. \n\nHe came after me begging me not to overreact, I didn't say a word and took off to my car. In the days since he's gone from begging me to \"be reasonable,\" to begging me not to break up with him and promising he'll never do it again.\n\nThe thing is, I love these jeans. Yes as a trophy of me being petty and at least ruining something of hers like she had he tag teamed to ruin my heart and self esteem. But they are also a super expensive brand, they look really good on me and I like wearing them. \n\nSo EX has gone from begging me to get back together with him to saying that me keeping the jeans is causing him \"real problems.\" I don't give a slight shit about his problems but I sort of feel bad about keeping this girl's clothes. \n\nSo I'm asking...I know I'm petty...but am I an asshole?\n\nEdit: the plot thickens, I just woke up to following text:\n\n\"hi, Alyssa. This is the weirdest text I've ever written. I'm Madison and I was the girl in Aiden's room last week. I'm so, so, so sorry, I don't know how to say it other than that. The look on your face will haunt me for the rest of my life. Please believe me when I say I didn't know he had a girlfriend. I would have never been there had I known. You have every reason not to care, but this last year has been so hard for me, my dad died of pancreatic cancer in December and I'm struggling so hard and find myself making bad choice after bad choice which I how came to be in Aiden's room. The pants you have are the ones I bought the day before my dad died, he gave me \"permission\" to go treat myself and it's the last time I ever heard him call me by his pet name as in \"pumpkin, please don't be afraid to get you want, buy your jeans.\" It would mean the world to me if you returned them to me. I know you've been hurt and I feel for you and I think Aiden is pure scum, all I want from him is getting my pants back. Please find it in your heart to return them to him or contact me directly. Thank you so much, Madison.\"\n\nSo I guess I have to give them back...I'm in tears here.\n\nEdit 2: just woke Aiden up at 5:45 (on Org Chem test day too...fuck him) with \"what's Madison's last name?\" He tried to give me the \"who's Madison?\" at first but then told him she texted me. He tried to talk me out of it but then relented so he could go back to sleep. So I looked her up on Facebook and it's pretty bare but she does have a \"instamodel\" sister who has all sorts of sad posts with like her holding her dads hand while has IV and then a somewhat touching insta memorial to her dad...so I'm thinking the text is not a lie.\n\nEdit3: I just texted back and forth with her, we\u2019re meeting at Starbucks at 9.\n\n\nEdit4: (Wednesday evening\u2014had tried to do a new post but mods suggested I just edit the op...so this is a cut and paste. Hope it makes sense I\u2019m just starting on my second bottle of skinny girl so hope this makes sense) So wow, that first post got a ton of heat and I'm so thankful, really for the chance to get some input but also because a lot of you are very, very funny and I appreciated the laughs. I don't know what the overall verdict was but I'm ok to think I was being an asshole in keeping the jeans.\n\nSo like many of you saw, the girl (Madison) texted me overnight telling me about why the jeans were important to her and asking if I would give them back. We texted back and forth a few times this morning and agreed we'd meet at the Starbucks by campus so I could return them. I got there and instantly recognized her and she got up and gave me a hug which I thought was very sweet (I'm a hugger too) and she had bought me like three different varieties of venti drinks to make sure she got one I liked (or as she admitted later, she was so nervous she didn't know what to do) which I also thought was very cool. I wasn't sure whether or not I even really wanted to talk with her but the coffee was enough entre to get me to sit down. I handed her the jeans and she was very thankful and again explained the story about her dad and teared up. Lots of people told me not to believe her but if she's lying, she's a sociopath because I could tell she was really upset by it. I did my best to comfort her which I hope was well received.\n\nSo as we got past that the only things I wanted to know were: how long had she known Aiden, did she know about me being his girlfriend and was she hoping to continue seeing him. She said they met when he and some friends went to her restaurant maybe a month ago and had been texting back and forth ever since, she said last Tuesday was the first time they'd met in person and she said she swore to god she didn't know he had a girlfriend. She said after I showed up Tuesday she was so disgusted she got dressed in her spare clothes (fat lot of good it did me to steal her jeans if my plan was to embarrass her) and left and didn't even process that her special jeans were gone until about a day later when she stared bugging him to get them back but she had no interest in seeing him. She said she was so frustrated with him stonewalling her had stopped by to get my number directly but he wouldn't even do that so she got it from his neighbor who happened to hear them arguing...she'd had my number since Sunday but was too nervous to text until yesterday.\n\nLots more happened and I can expand more in the comments but I think i'm running out of room...anyways so our plan is she is not going to tell him that I gave her the jeans back and start to demand he pay for them or buy her a new pair. When he does, she'll just give me the money or the jeans and then we'll give him the old...\"thanks for the jeans but us adults already worked it out...toodles.\" Yes we are deceiving him but we both agree he deserves it.\nLike I said lots more details but running into the 3000 character limit so I can say more if anyone is interested. Thank you for being so invested in my life. I've felt pretty rejected since this all went down and will have a hole in my heart for a long time...the kindness of internet strangers really, really helped for a few hours",

I don\u2019t see why someone would want to hold on to something that belongs to the woman that your significant other cheated with. Theft aside, it\u2019s holding on to a memory of betrayal. It\u2019s Using the fit and brand as a justification for an irrational thought response in order to hold onto it. Perhaps OP feels like the woman hurt her, not only because she slept with her significant other, but because she looked really good and ate pizza with him while OP refrained from pizza in order to live up to certain expectations, putting time and effort into supporting her SOs diet while he not only slept with another woman but ate pizza with her. She loved him, so naturally, she resented her in that moment and acted irrationally. It was human. \n\nHowever, now, OP needs to look within herself and ask why she kept the jeans. Why is it so important to keep them? Is she resentful towards the woman and feels a sense of power taking something she loves away..just like the woman did with OPs man? Does she feel insecure and the jeans provide her with a sense of security considering they belonged to the woman he cheated with? \n\nIdk enough details to say anything about the woman. Even if she knew about OP, it took 2 to tango and OPs resentment and anger should be directed towards her ex. \n\nRegardless, I hope you work through things OP. Im sorry you had to experience that and especially firsthand. I\u2019m sure the jeans look great on you, but I think you should be the bigger person and give them back. You won\u2019t lose anything but the physical item representing the betrayal you experienced.

Really goes to show that a lot of people's moral compasses really only apply to themselves. \n\nEVEN IF this girl boned OP's boyfriend knowing that she existed, it does not justify OP stealing from her (especially since the jeans are expensive). I can understand doing something rash in the heat of the moment, but choosing to keep the jeans out of some twisted sense of retribution is pretty fucked up. Someone wronging you emotionally =/= their property being up for grabs for the people they've wronged. \n\nI guarantee every single person in this thread has hurt at least 1 person in their lives. I highly doubt they'd all be OK if that person stole something expensive of theirs as \"payback\".",
