  "post content": "My (30F) and bf (32M) have been talking about our future quite a bit, and he wants to get married and start a family. We\u2019ve been together almost 2 years. We generally get a long really well and we both love each other very much. This whole issue is over whether I\u2019m being as A*hole for wanting this engagement ring. \n\n\nWe\u2019ve been long distance our entire relationship, and I drove up 5hrs each way see him 100% of the relationship. About 6ish months ago when our future came up I mentioned that my family is Muslim and the dowry requirement is practically non negotiable and is fairly sizable. We talked about it and nearly had a falling out, I wound up telling my family that I wasn\u2019t getting a dowry and that would be it. I nearly lost my relationship with my mom and brother, and I don\u2019t already have a relationship with my dad. This was very devastating since my family is extremely important to me, and so is my culture- but I conceded to this bf it was a huge ask. \n\nWell later we talked weddings, and he said he absolutely hated weddings and didn\u2019t see a point to them and were a huge waste of money. Again, my family is huge on weddings and marriages are a family affair. Also I kind of wanted a wedding since my culture we have amazing weddings and I grew up going to and being a part of everyone\u2019s wedding and I always wanted my own that my mom could shine at. Anyways, I also conceded to this since his reasoning makes sense we decided we\u2019d both like an elopement. \n\nAbout a 5mos ago he asked me to move in. This meant I\u2019d leave my job that I love more than anything, and was incredibly difficult for me to consider. The only job I could find was in my old field that I worked hard to leave and am taking a 23K pay cut for the next 2 years. But I did this for love. Plus I\u2019m moving my whole life to be with him. So I said \u201cthe only thing I ask is an engagement ring that I\u2019d like that is 2cts which is about 30K-ish.\u201d He responded \u201cokay\u201d which I thought he meant he was good with it. He makes about 50K more than I do, and Well into 6 figures no debt. \n\n\nIt\u2019s now 2 days into me moving in. He asked me to send him a few rings I like, and he was genuinely shocked at the price. I didn\u2019t really understand why. He said he could afford it but it would be half his savings- which he doesn\u2019t mind spending, but he thinks an engagement ring is too frivolous. \n\nI was shocked and upset because I already quit my job, moved in, and locked into a new job that I hate all for him and the one thing I thought I mentioned clearly he scoffed at. \n\n\nI get that it\u2019s expensive. I\u2019m extremely financially savvy, and even conceded that we cut back on a lot of spending in the future. Also I even offered to help him find a stream of income to help him make back the cost and more. \n\n\nI get it\u2019s not a good look, but is my one ask of an engagement ring I want really make me an asshole?\n\nEdit: The dowry was a 6 figure investment (real estate or stocks/bonds) that would be ours unless there was a divorce that was his fault- then it\u2019d be mine. He said he\u2019d only buy into that if it would be ours 50/50 defeating the purpose of a dowry. So I told my family we weren\u2019t going to do this. \n\nWe talked about finances a year ago and I mentioned that I\u2019m very okay financially, but changing job/career would set me back. He then told me recently after this ring debaucle that He didn\u2019t know I would ever actually hold him to this expectation. \n\n\nHe has done a bit for me. He paid for most of our  meals when ever I\u2019d visit. Then he said he didn\u2019t like how much he spent and that I should be helping pay so cost sharing went to 60/40 between him and me. \n\nEdit2: I showed him this post and there\u2019s something he\u2019d like me to add which is fair- I am not paying the mortgage or any form of \u201crent\u201d (but I am paying utilities and groceries) to make up for the cost of my move up to be with him. This is until we actually get married. Once we\u2019re married I want to split everything equally. \n\nAlso it\u2019s 23k less annually.\n\nDowry explained: A dowry in our culture is a gift to the bride that the family is witness to.\n\nMy family traditionally has it  to be a year of my salary- or his salary if I\u2019m unemployed. I negotiated with my family that it be in the form of investment (like real estate) and it be transferred to my name in the case of a divorce, otherwise it\u2019d be ours while we\u2019re married. And since I work it\u2019s a year of my salary which is significantly more than 30k (several times more). \n\nI\u2019m the last to be married so there\u2019s a ton of pressure from my grandparents.\n\nThe purpose so that if anything happens and my husband leaves me- I\u2019m financially okay. He didn\u2019t want any of it, he didn\u2019t like the idea of buying something that\u2019d eventually be all mine worst case scenario.",

One coached me to communicate in my first relationship. The other friend showed me how a great couple can have different interests and give each other both space and accommodation. I learned a ton from them on what makes a supportive, equal, and joyful relationship.\n\n2) It's not about what the guy will/will not do for you (\"kissing your feet\"): it's about the kind of people they are. A guy who kisses your feet because he is infatuated with you can easily leave you as he become infatuated with someone else. A guy who is steadfast, generous, and loving as a person will be steadfast, generous, and loving as a partner and \\*that's\\* a good man.\n\n3) Unless your family is abusive or dysfunctional, a good man will not take you away from your family, but rather will help you grow closer; a good man will not make you hate or doubt yourself, but will help you grow into a better version of yourself.\n\nIt sounds like rainbows and unicorns, but plenty of my friends and myself have discovered that, when you work hard at being a loving, good person yourself, rainbows and unicorns appear!",
