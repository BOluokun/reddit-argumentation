  "post content": "My ex and I are split up.  Our older son lives with him and younger with me.  We are both not high income but he somehow landed a wife who makes 4x our income and they often go out of the country on nice vacations which I guess he has been sharing with the kids.\n\nThe kids want their passports now thanks to his brainwashing. I initially said yes because him and my son caught me off guard and started asking me if it was okay one day.  Then I had time to think about it and realized how bad things are in the world right now and I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth the risk and danger having the kids so far away from me and out of the country with their dad and stepmom.  They also need my consent per our custody agreement to go out of the country anyway, and at this point I\u2019d never say yes.\n\nSo today when my ex asked me if X date was okay for the passport appointment I asked where he is even going to be taking the kids, to which he told me \u201che didn\u2019t know yet, they just want to get the ball rolling because it takes 3 months just to get the passport and they haven\u2019t planned anything specific yet\u201d which I find sketchy.\n\nSo I told him and the kids no, that he needs my consent to take them anywhere because of how bad the world is right now and I\u2019d never agree so passports are pointless.  My younger son got upset and my ex got angry also and kept repeating \u201care you just never going to allow them to go anywhere then?\u201d I never said that, just not right now.\n\nSo my ex is texting me now saying I\u2019m an asshole and I\u2019m \u201crobbing my kids of experiences\u201d except I never have gone out of the country and don\u2019t have a passport and I am fine, so I don\u2019t really buy it.  Like does a 7 year old and a 14 year old really need to experience japan or england or whatever, they can go when they are 18 and probably appreciate it more then. Other than some initial disappointment my kids haven\u2019t even mentioned it to me again so I have a feeling they don\u2019t really care and it\u2019s more their dad influencing them.\n\nSo AITA?",

They are old enough to know you\u2019re the only thing standing in the way of them and world traveling and they may not be bringing it up, as you say, but this will hurt your relationship with them.
