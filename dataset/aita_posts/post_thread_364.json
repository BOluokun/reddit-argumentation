  "post content": "I ride the bus because I can't afford a car, insurance, gas, etc. I'm 19F and live in the US. For context. \n\nA couple days ago I was on a bus that wasn't that busy. Not empty, but there were multiple unused seats and no one had to stand. I had just gone shopping and had heavy bags that were hard to carry and hardly fit in front of my legs. \n\nSo I sat in one seat and placed my bags on the seat next to me, essentially taking up 2 seats on my own. Since it wasn't crowded when I got on I didn't see an issue and like I said the bags were super heavy and hurt to carry so I wanted to set them down. \n\nThe bus ride was kind of long and as it went on more and more people got on the bus. It eventually got pretty crowded to the point where some people had to stand up. \n\nI didn't ever move my bag or offer the seat to someone. In my experience most people don't want to sit next to strangers anyway and a lot of the time people will end up standing instead of sitting in an empty seat next to someone they don't know. Also no one said anything to me. \n\nAt the last stop (ended at the bus station where pretty much everyone was getting off) someone passive aggressively told me \"you could have moved your bag and not been inconsiderate and rude. Everyone wants to sit not just you.\" Or something along those lines. I didn't really respond because I didn't know what to say. \n\nThe person who said that never asked me to move my stuff, and if they did I probably would have. So I don't understand how I was being rude? They could have asked during the ride instead of insulting me after it was already done. Busses are also generally first come first serve so I think my behavior was normal. \n\nAITA?",

We'd all spread out a bit and put our bags on the seat. As it got more crowded, we early people compacted down to one seat each and sometimes even stood a few stops early... with our bags. \n\nProper protocol is that the empty seat beside you can be used for an item until the point there are limited seats available. \n\nWhen the bus is more than 50% full, you don't wait to be asked, you put that item on your lap and be grateful that you got to use the seat for half the journey for your bags. \n\nYou know it's time to compact into one seat if you don't see any empty window seats.  That's the time to clear the aisle seat of your possessions in preparation for boarding passengers.",
