  "post content": "I f36 have been with my boyfriend m41 for 2 years. He has 3 kids (6,12,4) while I have a 16 year old son.\n\n\n\nThe other day my 12 yo stepson fell off the stairs and injured his anckle, his dad and I had to get him to the hospital and needed someone to stay with the kids while we were there. My boyfriend told my son to skip workday and stay with and watch his stepbrothers.\n\n\nWhen we returned, My son asked my boyfriend to pay him for \"babysitting\" \"his kids\" I admit my son doesn't have the best relationship with his stepdad or stepsiblings but My boyfriend and I were shocked by this. My son explained that he had to skip a workday which cost him to lose money and asked my boyfriend to pay him for his time. My boyfriend scolded him harshly and told him that staying home with his stepbrothers isn't babysitting and he deserves no money for it. plus that skipping one day of work won't do much harm. but my son disagreed and kept arguing with my boyfriend saying his stepbrothers aren't his responsibility. My boyfriend ended up punishing him and taking away all his electronics as well as cancelling his birthday months away. My son fought back talking about how unfair this was and asked me to get involved. I sided with my boyfriend because I really did not appreciate how my son used this family emergency to his advantage and thought he'd get money out of helping family out. My son didn't like where I stood in this conflict and accused me of favoring my stepkids to stay on my boyfriend's good side while ignoring the mistreatment towards him. I cut the argument and he's become silent eversince. even refused to eat with us or sit with us.\n\n\nAITA for agreeing with my boyfriend to punish my son?",

Your son had to miss out on a day of work, a day of pay, and you couldn\u2019t pay him for babysitting? The 12 year olds father could have gone to the hospital with his son alone, while you stayed home with the rest of the kids. This isn\u2019t your sons problem. It doesn\u2019t take 2 people for a sprained or broken ankle. \n\nThat would be enough all on its own for you to be TA, but then you actually took away all of his electronics AND cancelled his birthday? He\u2019s turning 17. A year after that, he\u2019s going to never see or speak to you again if you keep choosing your boyfriend and pretend step kids over your own son.\n\nEdit: I have to thank everyone for the rewards!

My son was only asked to babysit his sister when: 1. I had to go somewhere I couldn't take her, 2. If he had no plans, and 3. I paid him immediately when I got home. Lastly, no bf was EVER allowed to discipline my children. It was also my firm boundary that they NEVER come between me and my children. If so, my children would win because I'm their mother. So, I look at it this way: did you follow ANY of these? No. You act like you're a wife to him (you're not) and mother to his children more than your own son. Of course he's pissed. He was forced to skip a paying job for another that was non paying, to take care of kids that aren't his, in a family that's not his, and was treated like shit for doing so. I'd permanently leave if I was him. How do you fix this: 1. Both you and bf apologize. 2. Pay him the same wages he would've gotten for going to work. 3. Set your boundaries with the bf regarding discipline with YOUR child. 4. Ffs, give him back ALL of his electronics and 5. NEVER ask him to babysit again!!! Bf needs to find his own sitter for HIS kids and pay them. Frankly, this \"man\" wouldn't last even a minute with me. You both are AH!",

And my mom was totally cool with it. \n\nThis sums it up perfectly! I was going to say something similar. From what I understood of this story, the poor kid took off work last minute to do a favor for some guy who\u2019s dating his mom and then got punished for it. And the punishment is absolutely ridiculous and disproportional to the perceived slight. He had every right to say \u201cno, sorry, but I can\u2019t miss work.\u201d And they would still be in the wrong if they punished him for that. He\u2019s 16 and sounds like he\u2019s more mature than the two adults in this situation. \n\nIt absolutely blows my mind that they would think it\u2019s okay to treat their child like free labor. And letting the boyfriend punish her son. This is just horrible parenting and I imagine her son must have felt so betrayed when he asked mom to intervene and she instead took her boyfriends side. I\u2019m a single mom to a teen and I couldn\u2019t imagine ever taking a partner\u2019s side over my son or letting them punish him. I would never ask my son to miss work to take care of my partners kids unless it was totally unavoidable (which I don\u2019t think it is in this case) and then I\u2019d expect for my son to be paid whatever he lost in wages. He doesn\u2019t owe them anything and they aren\u2019t entitled to his time. \n\nIn this situation, OP could have stayed with the kids. I doubt they even let her inside. It\u2019s been my experience in the last two years, that doctors offices only allow one parent in with the child (my son has been sick and we\u2019ve been to many doctors offices; every single one we\u2019ve been to has had this rule). I can\u2019t imagine hospitals would be different. This whole thing is so ridiculous. The kid could have lost his job for calling in last minute. And the mom doesn\u2019t even care. Seems like she cares more about pleasing her boyfriend than parenting her child. I hope she realizes that what she did was wrong and apologizes to her son for this mistreatment. Otherwise we might see her here again in a few years whining about why her son isn\u2019t talking to her, visiting her, inviting her to his wedding, or something similar.",

She admitted to me as an adult that she never wanted kids, but my father did, so they adopted me. But she spent a great deal of time making me feel worthless and not good enough and not like my \"perfect\" cousins. My mother separated from my father when I was 5, and my father ended up with custody of me. But he had his own issues. Fast forward to. me turning 18. 2 weeks after my birthday I was moved out. I chose to not have contact with them, and only called them on Christmas. This lasted over a decade. My father passed away in 2006, and I stepped up and took care of all the arrangements INCLUDING taking him to another country where he had wanted to retire/be buried. My relationship with my mother greatly improved after this. We started having ADULT conversations and we have grown closer. But we will NEVER have the relationship she thinks we should have - one where I call everyday, etc. I left my ex of 14 years, and moved 700 miles away to another state. My mother is mad that I moved away without consulting her and giving her a chance to \"talk me out if it\" (her words!) Mind you I am in my 40's. I am planning a wedding, and she has threatened to not come if I do not invite HER cousin to my very small wedding. It's a mess. \n\nBut in short: she made her bed years ago when I was a child and she took everyone else's lies about me as truth instead of believing me. She made her bed when she verbally, emotionally and mentally abused me. She's lucky I still maintain some form of contact.",
