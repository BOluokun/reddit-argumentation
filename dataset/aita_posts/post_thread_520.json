Something along the lines of \u201cmoms in the hospital, something to do with an OD but her boyfriend also didn\u2019t call 911 from 2am -11am.\u201d\n\nI live in Oregon my mom lives in Arizona.\n\nI call both her phone and her boyfriends hoping my brother had it wrong but nope. the crazy boyfriend ends up calling me back. He starts out the call saying he didn\u2019t call me because my mom made him take my phone number out of his phone because she didn\u2019t trust him with it. odd! But okay. he then says that he heard her fall at 2am and he found her unresponsive. He couldn\u2019t pick her up he is like late 60s she is 56 so he pulled her to bed room by the arm and left her next to the bed. He said it sounded like she was snoring! he was yelling and shaking her and not getting a response.\n\nso he treated her for shock!\n\nHe gives a list of drugs they have at the house almost a brag. Like I think that shits cool what a fucking absolute idiot!!!! He says he stashed them instead of handing them off the medics!!\n\nThen he proceeds to rambling about Montana and all sorts of crazy garble about his good ol days. I quickly get off phone with him. \n\nWhen I get to Hopistal I thought she was gonna die but luckily she pulled through but not before almost losing her kidneys having rabdo which is when your muscles start breaking down do to lack of oxygen and send toxins into body. Flash pulmonary edema where her lungs filled with fluid and so on.\n He lives 30 minutes or so from hospital and didn\u2019t come visit once!!!!!\n\nSo to try to make a long story short when I showed up there were three case workers who informed me that adult protective services where stepping in. And a protective order was going to be placed against him. \n\nOnce mom finally comes to she says she wants to go home to Oregon with me......I extend my stay in AZ I\u2019m now a couple grand deep on this trip!  \n\nSoo here is the, am I an ass hole part!!?? \nWe made it back to my place but she is in a fog and it\u2019s like she has Alzheimers or dementia now.... mentioned memory lapse before we left hospital but they said it was sedation could last a week or so... I have had to relive her losing her mother about 10 times now and my father who passed away 4 months ago another 10 times or more. She is finally starting to remember those events happens but still a lot missing!\n\nbut now she wants to speck with the ex.. to find out what happened she is super confused and pretty much told me she had to ask him what she felt about the situation! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f my life right now!\n\nSo I refuse to let her talk to him she is now thinking I\u2019m conspiring against her but yet happy to be here depending soon which wave we are in. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not letting her talk to him.",

The doctors may or may not have been able to give  a proper assessment due to the drugs in the system. She probably wants to talk to the ex to understand what happened, because of her blanks.

If, when she's feeling clearer in the head and can make choices again, she chooses to see him, there's just not a lot you can do, but right now I'd deny her request, and perhaps see if you or your sibling can get legal guardianship over her in some way, so that you are also legally allowed to make decisions like those for her.",

She experienced a stroke 2 years back and also has aphasia he wouldn\u2019t drive her 30 minutes out of the way for therapy unless it\u2019s on days he goes to the VA. During the stroke it was a similar situation where he failed to respond appropriately assuming she was high on something! He did eventually pack her into his truck and take her to hospital but not before stopping for cigarettes! Which he probably smoked on the way to hospital with her in car. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f to say the least she was pissed about it and we discussed calling no matter what even explain that there are laws in place to protect him from drug charges if he reports potential OD. I am hoping she makes a recovery to a point she can understand what happened. But yeah if mental status doesn\u2019t clear up I will have to take the route of guardianship which kills me I feel like I\u2019m some how taking her freedom you know",
