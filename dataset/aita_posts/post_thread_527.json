  "post content": "First time poster, so sorry for any mistakes. \n\nMy (24f) older sister Josie (29), is a vet and is still working through the current sitution. Several lambs were found to be super sick this morning at a farm.  My sister spent all day treating them and wasn\u2019t going to be able to go back to the farm for a couple of days.  Based on their status at the end of the day, she was concerned the lambs would die if left at the farm.  So she ended up bringing them home to treat in our house to give them the best chance to survive. There was no cell service near the farm, so she couldn\u2019t call to ask if this was okay.  Unfortunately, one of the three lambs was severely sick, was deteriorating rapidly, and passed away. \n\nSo, I was not told that Josie was bringing these lambs home. She just called me up and asked me to set up our puppy\u2019s pen. I assumed she had found someone\u2019s lost dog or something since she asked me to put our pups outside. When she came home, she brought in a tub of three lambs. I was pretty shocked, as she\u2019s never done anything like this before. I started freaking out a bit since one already looked like it was dead and I do NOT deal well with death or dead things in general. I quickly excused myself and spent the next 2 hours or so crying and almost hyperventilating thinking about the lambs dying in our kitchen.\n\nI finally came out of my room for dinner and Josie casually mentioned that one of the lambs had died and her colleague had come by and picked it up. I basically shut down into a panic, asked for the keys to the car we share, and went for a drive. I was gone for about 20-30 minutes, just letting myself cry it all out, since I felt so bad for not wanting these animals in our small house, but I didn\u2019t want them to die just because I was uncomfortable. So here\u2019s where I may be the a-hole. When I left, I forgot my phone at home and didn\u2019t say where I was going or when I\u2019d be back. Josie freaked out because she was obviously worried and had my whole family calling to try and find me. So now I feel doubly bad because my sister was just trying to help these lambs and I bolted on her and worried everyone. AITA for freaking out over having dying lambs in the house?\n\nTL;DR: My sister is a vet and brought home 3 dying lambs to try to save them. I freaked out when one died in our kitchen and bolted without saying where I was going or when I\u2019d be back, causing my whole family to worry about me. AITA?",

Your response to death and loss is not healthy, and I hope for your sake that you can seek help now- if this is your reaction to a *lamb* dying out of sight/earshot/knowledge to you, I can\u2019t imagine what the death of a family member or loved one would do.\n\nETA: spelling.",
