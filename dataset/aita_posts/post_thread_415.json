Everyone in my family is bilingual and they tend to mix English and Spanish constantly.\nMy siblings spouses have all learned some Spanish, some better, some worse, but they can still participate in all conversations.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my husband for 10 years. He took a few classes but he found it too difficult and decided that he can\u2019t learn a language as it\u2019s his thing just like math isn\u2019t his thing and he dropped it.\n\nEvery family gathering (there are a lot of them) he feels left out because everyone switches back and forth and he doesn\u2019t understand them. I have to translate for him and it really must be uncomfortable for him.\n\nThis year he said that he\u2019s not coming, he feels excluded and even when he talks with non Mexican spouses, they mix and match languages and he felts it\u2019s to mock him because there\u2019s no need to.\n\nI called my mother and told her that they must promise to not speak Spanish because it\u2019s excluding my husband or were not coming.\nMy mother was angry, she told me they\u2019re not going to police their speech, that they were accommodating for the first few years but he made no effort and it\u2019s ridiculous that he doesn\u2019t even try. I told her to at he did try but she knows it\u2019s difficult for him.\n\nShe said that he\u2019s no longer invited and I can come on my own. I was really angry and repeatet my ultimatum. This didn\u2019t go down well. My whole family is pissed off, my husband is on my side and I don\u2019t know anymore. AITA for giving them the ultimatum?",

Him not wanting to try is not your family's problem. Him being upset people dare speak a language he can't and feeling mocked also isn't anyone's problem but his own.\n\nEta with this getting attention I want to say that I know some people simply can't learn languages to a degree where communication is possible and that's not their fault, but to me it seems like husband is actively not trying at all instead of trying hard and failing.",

Once the kid can engage with the hearing world they seem to think that's good enough. These are people that are otherwise very good parents.

Hearing parents to a deaf kid who learn ASL are unfortunately in the minority.\n\nI'm HoH and have an audio processing disorder.

Even folks for whom math \"is not their thing\" learn enough to understand money, measure how big a throw rug needs to be, and follow a recipe.  Your husband needs to work on getting to a \"just getting by\" level of Spanish.  Even if his Spanish always suck and he never gets past the level of a Spanish-speaking kindergartener, I suspect your family will appreciate the effort and be a lot more willing to bend their \"Spanglish\" toward the English side to help him. As a result, his Spanish skills will increase as he uses it.  \n\nMaybe you two can institute a \"Spanish day\" once a week in your home to improve his language ability?",
