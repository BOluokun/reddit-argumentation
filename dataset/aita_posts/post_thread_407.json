  "post content": "\nI (single mom of 2) hired a babysitter after I started working a new job (used to do wfh for 2 years).\n\nMy kids are 8 & 6. The babysitter is 17. she brings her laptop with her to study which is perfectly ok with me as long as she keeps an eye on the kids.\n\n\nYesterday, I came home and the babysitter showed me her laptop that got broken by my youngest. I was shocked I asked how this happened, and she said that she left the laptop in the livingroom and went to make the kids lunch but my youngest grabbed it and ran with it til he dropped it and broke the screen. I said that was horrible and apologized to her but stated it was her fault for leaving the laptop within reach of children. She said she thought my kids were old enough to know not to touch others stuff. I explained how they might have thought it belonged to us since it was in our house. She asked if I could pay for it to get fixed but I refused and insisted it was her problem not mine. She ranted about having exams soon and not having enough money to get it fixed. We argued and I had to tell her to go home after she presisted.\n\nLater on, I got a call from her dad basically blaming the whol thing on me, and demanding I pay to get the laptop fixed but I still refused. now she's refusing to come again unless I pay her for the laptop repair even though I paid her in advance to watch the kids.",

So there was basically only one toy we couldn't have: one she had already bought. Mom told us many times (and enforced) that if we lost or broke a toy, that was it; she always said that **objects deserve respect**. She told us openly that she didn't want us to get spoiled, that some ppl who have lots of things lose sense of their value.\n\nI don't even know what mom would have done if i broke someone *else's* things.\n\nThis paragraph is just me reflecting on and being grateful for the incredibly healthy attitude toward material things i was taught. I had the privilege not to stress about them, but the wisdom to enjoy it. sometimes ppl praise my resulting perspective for what they perceive as a lack of materialism, ppl say oh good for you realizing things aren't important. But it's actually hardcore materialism, appreciation of objects. \"New\" things aren't better than old things, a purchase isn't a high that wears off. I bought excellent boots a year ago and every time i wear them i feel happy i still own them, that they aren't lost or broken yet. Actually i like my old things best cuz there are fewer unknowns. The downsides of a new thing are responsibility for it, less flexibility (nonliquid assets), and less attention left for whatever you already own; but i rly enjoy finding something worth buying. (I also think \"money can't buy happiness\" is a lie we parrot to shift focus away from wealth disparity.)\n\nTldr i am a more content, generous, thoughtful person thanks to my mom. YTA cuz...
