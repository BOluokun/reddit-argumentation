  "post content": "So my (29f) boyfriend (27m) and I were at a bar that has video games and we were casually playing smash. Context here is that I suck at playing video games. I am very much a noob. I've only played Smash and Kirby is my jam. My BF does not suck at video games. In fact, he's been playing them all his life and even has a video game related career going for him. He has always beat me in every game, especially Smash.\n\nLast night we were playing and surprisingly I was just whipping his ass with Kirby while he main'd Mario. At first, he was proud. We jokingly shit talk eachother all the time, whether playing games or in life, and during this match, the shit talking seemed fun. \n\nWelp, close to the end of our game, the waiter came by to ask how we were doing. I said \"awesome, I'm beating his ass\". The Waiter asked if we needed anything else and I said \"some bandages for him and maybe an empty pitcher for his tears.\" Now, after I said this, I didn't notice my boyfriend being annoyed. Honestly, I thought he was laughing with me. We played Kirby vs Kirby and I won. Finally, I played Mario (a character I never play) and he played Kirby. He won. After winning, he got kinda loud and was like \"See this is the evidence that Kirby is a broken character! It is definitive that this character is a bad character and is noob friendly.\" \n\nI was annoyed by this, not because I lost the final match, but just his announcement that my character sucks and all my wins were due to it being broken. As we were walking home, I tried to ask him why he had to make such a show that Kirby is a broken character, just be a gracious loser that I won all those other rounds. He would say, \"yeah, you won, But...\",  then follow up with his long explanation why me playing Kirby doesn't really matter because the character is broken and hit boxes, yada yada....\n\nIt led to an argument because I was really annoyed that he couldn't just be a good sport. We weren't playing competitively. Shit, I don't even know about tiers or smash players. I was playing for fun with a character that I always play. It annoyed me to because everytime we play, I'm always losing. I \"got good\" and beat him.\n\nLater on, he came to me and apologized for how he responded. He told me that the reason why he said what he said was because of my shit talking to the waiter annoyed him.\n\nI told him I'm not going to apologize for making jokes that I would typically make. I'm not apologizing because his ego is hurt that I beat him with Kirby. I'm not going to \"appeal to [his] authority\" just because he works in the industry knows more about video games and its culture than I do. What do you think?\n\nEdit 1 : (I mentioned this in one of my comments) \"I should have made it clear that we know the waiter, we're regulars at that bar, and we both were joking/ shit talking with the waiter. I just happened to be in the advantage point of winning at that time, so yeah, I was a little cocky.\" It's not the first time we played games at this bar or joked/shit talked one another in the presence of a waiter. It is the first time one of us got upset about it.\"\n\nEdit 2: (also posted below) \"It seems like a lot of people are pretty upset by the shit talking because i did it in front of the waiter (public shaming) and that my post isnt clear on if I was the only one talking shit in front of the waiter. It might read that I was the only one, but I was not. We both engaged in shit talking in the presence of the waiter. What I said, within the circumstances of the game, just seemed to cross the line. Which is why I brought up the ego part, the amount of times I've lost and endeared the shit talking... it doesn't phase me. But I actually won for once and I'm the asshole for dishing the shit.\n\nI'll admit for being cold to his feelings about feeling embarrassed, but I'm just not being sold on being more of the asshole because I talked shit and won.  I am interested on people's thoughts though.\"\n\nFinal edit: I am really glad that I posted and heard from ya'll. My boyfriend saw the post and shared that he really didn't know the waiter like that and did feel publicly shamed. I apologized for embarrassing him and it is noted that we both won't shit talk in the presence of strangers again. Thanks for helping us grow up.\n\nTl;dr- AITA for shit talking my boyfriend when playing video games and beating him with Kirby?",

I am here to help him through his feelings and if I'm wrong, I'll apologize. Outside of being social and continuing to joke with the waiter like we both had been doing, I do not see what I did that was wrong. \n\nYou mentioned it's kinda weird that he seems insecure about losing to me. That's on him to figure out. I'll be here to help, but i'm not gonna change my character (kirby) or apologize just because he's insecure about losing. It's the same thing with a jealous person. It's not on the other individual to fix unless they are purposely trying to make that person jealous. I wasn't purposely trying to make him feel insecure.\n\nNevertheless, he and I will talk more about it once we're off from work.",

Yes, he should not have been as butt hurt as going off about the character and what have you, but he eventually recognized he was being shitty and apologized.

You essentially ignored what he said (about his feelings) and made it about how you have a point of \"not apologising for something i'd normally do\". Even if you normally don't refrain from such, in this instance he mentioned it bothered him, and you just said essentially that you don't care.\n\nIf both of you spent more time listening to each other than trying to \"win\" you may find things a bit smoother. There is no weakness in accepting than another's attempts to \"climb down\" is an opportunity to diffuse the situation and put it to bed, but you instead used it as an opportunity to reiterate how you were \"right\", and won't climb down, and he wasn't.
