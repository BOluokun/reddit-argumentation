  "post content": "My husband hid $1500 (some insurance payout) from me and he played the whole \u201cI don\u2019t have money for gas\u201d victim part. This money is not part of our savings or anything. Anyway, he had been hiding the money for 2 weeks. During those two weeks I bought groceries for us, I paid for our take out food, I offered to pay for his broken windshield, and overall I was concerned about whether or not he had enough money for himself. He saw me struggle putting to put gas in my truck. He let me pay for his car insurance. He heard my concerns and my offers to help him and he did not once tell me not to worry.\n\nYesterday I asked him to lend me $20 because a friend invited me somewhere last minute and I didn\u2019t have cash. He got really nervous when I asked him if I could borrow his debit card. He started to act strange. I asked him if he was hiding something from me and he called me crazy and accused me of not believing him. I asked him if he was hiding money from me? And he denied it and said I was paranoid and crazy.\n\nHe checked his bank account in front of me and acted surprised. He literally shouted, \u201cwow wow wow I have extra money!!!! Oh my god this is so awesome!!\u201d And he played the whole I didn\u2019t know part.\n\nHe continued to argue and I told him that I don\u2019t care about the money I care about honesty. Why did he lie? and if he can lie so blatantly about this then he can lie (or has lied) about many things.\n\nIt took a whole day for him to finally confess that he was hiding the money from me because supposedly I was going to ask for some money if I knew. He said he felt guilty for not telling about it when he saw me struggle with money.\n\nToday I asked him to leave the house. I called him cruel and deceitful. I told him that I don\u2019t want to be with someone that can lie so blatantly.\n\nBy the way I\u2019m 6 months pregnant with a very wanted and planned baby. We\u2019ve know each other for 3 years.\n\nAm I the as*hole for leaving him over this? \nI\u2019m just so hurt by how easily he lied and called me crazy and paranoid. And now I\u2019m questioning everything in our relationship. Maybe his gym sessions are time that he spends with women. I don\u2019t know anything anymore.\n\n***UPDATE****\nI followed the advice I received here (thank you). He\u2019s back home but staying in the guest room. He came back with a brand new baby car seat (guilt?) and he\u2019s apologizing profusely. We\u2019ll be taking marriage counseling.",

She earns 45%, thus pays 45% of the household bills)\n\nDoing it this way means the wife doesn't hav eto explain every single personal purchase she makes, same deal with the husband. There's a level of autonomy that comes with separate finances.\n\nOf course, should the wife stop working to stay home with the kids, then this needs to be revisted, but so long as they are both earners, it works really well and a lot of marriage counselors will recommend this for couples who fight a lot about money.\n\nAlso, one thing a lot of women don't consider is... You're likely to outlive your man. If you don't have established finances separate from him, you'll find you're starting over, credit-wise.  And with more people opting to stay single longer/later in life, it makes good sense.\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/04/young-couples-separate-bank-accounts/558473/](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/04/young-couples-separate-bank-accounts/558473/)\n\n[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/home\\_economics/2011/02/yours\\_mine.html](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/home_economics/2011/02/yours_mine.html)",

But when my finances have been separate, we've always done it the way you describe here (on a percentage of take-home basis).  It's important to also have proportional retirement savings so it doesn't favor one partner over the other, and that should net out before you look at take-home pay.\n\nBut I'm with the majority of posters that say NTA.  I don't lie to my partner, ever.  That's part of how the relationship works.  He has all the passwords to any account or login he should want to look at (we use a password manager with individual and shared vaults) and I hide nothing from him.  I don't think he's ever logged into any of my accounts to check up on me, but the fact that he has those credentials, in part means, he doesn't have to.  And vice versa.  I have his phone unlock codes, but I don't ever use them, I've never felt the need.\n\nOur rule is, < $X00 is a purchase that, not only do you not have to explain, but that the other person doesn't get to ask about.  More than that, and you need to have a conversation.\n\nAdditionally, for any windfall that we should be fortunate enough to receive, we mark 10% for frivolous fun things and save the rest.\n\nIt works.
