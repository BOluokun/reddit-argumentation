  "post content": "So I\u2019m deaf in one ear, and sometimes I\u2019ll find myself waking up sleeping on my one good ear, so I won\u2019t be able to hear my alarm. So in order to fight this, I set 3 alarms in case I don\u2019t wake up to the ones before it. I have class at 9:15am so I set the alarms for 8:30-8:45. The problem is when they go off, my roommate will call my cellphone and hang up immediately to put the phone into snooze mode. He does this with every alarm that rings and today I missed my class because of it (I also woke up and eventually found my phone in my desk drawer). And it isn\u2019t that he needs sleep and needs to wake up later, because he has class the same time as me. I could ask him to wake me up when he gets up but that would make me feel like a burden. When I confronted him about him making me miss class he went silent, told me to stfu and that I move when the alarm goes off (he thinks that I\u2019m awake and that I ignore the alarm? Which I have no recollection of because if I was awake I would turn it off) and he left the room. Do I need to sleep earlier so I don\u2019t require an alarm in the morning? Or just set a singular alarm? Though he would just end up turning that one off, and I\u2019d have nothing to wake up to.  Am I in the wrong here?\n\nEdit: Apparently I\u2019m Patrick Star because I never knew vibrating alarm clocks existed. Thank you for letting me know!\n\nUpdate: He\u2019s planning on moving out in two weeks or so. Sucks we couldn\u2019t get along, but it\u2019s for the best considering my third roommate and I think he\u2019s a snake (for other reasons). ",
