  "post content": "So, I was going down a rabbit hole of boredom this evening and found a variety of personality quizzes. I stumbled across a kink/bdsm test and told my bf about it. He wanted to try it out try as well. \n\nHere's my trigger: I feel like my bf and I have a mutual understanding in those regards and know what  the other likes etc.  \n\nHe obviously did it on my computer and I wanted to watch. But ..... He apparently didn't like me looking at his answers because he didn't wanted \"that look\" from me. (Referring to the \"are you for real\" look, I assume)  I kind of got a little hurt. I thought we were able to talk openly about those things, but he wouldn't let me see. \n\nThe quiz ends up with telling you stuff like \"You're 90% most like likely to be a dom. Or you're 55% most likely to like pain.\" etc.  He did show me those results, but I don't know why he wouldn't let me see the answers. \n\nSo... Am I the A\\*\\*hole?",

But as someone who has been in similar positions, you can't pressure someone into talking about things they're not comfortable with. It won't end well for either of you. \n\nIn this context, he might have some kinks he's ashamed of or isn't ready to try it IRL. Some people have kinks in fantasies only, and really do not want to actually do it. There's porn I'd watch, but if I actually did it, I'm sure it would make me cry (in a very bad way).\n\nKinks involves overcoming internal shame as well. Perhaps he's into something that's often made fun of like foot fetishes, or maybe it's something more extreme like cock and ball torture and doesn't know how you'll react. Maybe he's into something he knows you aren't into, and he's embarrassed or worried you'll feel pressured into trying for him. Regardless of the reason, he can keep as much of it to himself as he wants. You say you have an open dialogue about your kinks, so let that assure you that if and when he wants to try something, he will let you know. \n\nPlus I get anxious when people stand over me and watch me answer quizzes or surveys of basic things like what type of ant I am (bull ant btw).",
