  "post content": "We live in a multi-generational household so on the weekends everyone is home. I\u2019m 8 months pregnant, already very uncomfortable as it is, so I try to do what I can to find comfort here and there. \n\nOn the weekends I tend to spend a lot of time in our room because in here I can be bra-less, wear tanks, crop pants whatever. We\u2019re conservative Hindus so this is not necessarily appropriate to do among the overall household but even if it was, I wouldn\u2019t feel okay doing it.\n\nMy husband asked me to start spending the day downstairs on weekends because he thinks it\u2019s not fair of me to be holed up all day and leave our toddler to him and his parents. He helps a lot with our toddler, he pointed out that he spends half the day with her on weekdays. Which is true. I\u2019m responsible for her nap time, bath time, night time routine and bed time, but he gives her lunch, plays with her outside in the evenings. He is currently waiting for a new job to start and I have quite a bit of summer studying to get through as I\u2019m a full time student, so this has been working for us the past few weeks. \n\nToday he asked me to stay downstairs on the weekends despite me being uncomfortable because he said it\u2019s not a huge ask. And honestly it\u2019s not, but I am big pregnant and uncomfortable. He wants me to especially be downstairs when his mom cooks on the weekends  because our toddler is really attached to her grandmother and gets in the way. I completely completely understand this and do what I can to keep our toddler away from my mil on the weekdays after she gets home. I\u2019ve asked him all he has to do is bring her up here on the weekends, she has toys here and we play. I also have sciatica so when it flares up I try to avoid the stairs as much as possible, like today. And I was sick with covid for about 10 days through the end of May, so I still have random intermittent symptoms pop up.\n\nI\u2019m currently on summer break for another 3 weeks but am full time in a very rigorous professional degree program. I will be giving birth at the start of the semester and will not be able to take any time off. So I\u2019m also just trying to relax as much as I can now because I know it won\u2019t be possible later. \n\nAITA?",

But on top of pregnancy you also have sciatica and a full study load. \n\nYou\u2019ve offered a compromise where you watch your toddler in your room. \n\nAnother alternative; could you stay downstairs with the family in the morning, and rest after lunch?",

He does a lot around the house, a lot of errands for his parents and grandparents, things for me and our daughter. In addition to his own stressful/demanding career. I feel the same way sometimes but these are active choices we\u2019ve both made. But I still do understand him wanting me to take our toddler today for a bit, I just don\u2019t understand why he expected me to come downstairs when she would have been perfectly happy upstairs with me and I could have still been comfortable.\n\nI think he\u2019s not liking being solely at home as he has been the past month, a lot of things come up when you\u2019re home and I think he\u2019s still adjusting to that.",

I\u2019ve had to remind him a few times that he went through medical school, he knows how difficult it is. And to now imagine doing that with a child, with in laws expecting things, and the responsibilities of being married to someone with a demanding schedule that requires me to manage his life.

I live with 6 other adults so it can be difficult to find some privacy at times, but at times it can also feel like I\u2019ve gone days without seeing anyone. Luckily we all have our own spaces we can retreat to. I also am not a huge fan of everyone always hanging out en masse in general. But I\u2019ve been in quarantine effectively since March and everyone else, except for my grandparents in law, have been leaving the house to go to work and grocery, etc. I\u2019ve gone to the doctor, the hospital, and to the Burger King drive through with my husband.
