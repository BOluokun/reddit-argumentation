  "post content": "We came home from the hospital 5 weeks ago with our first child, a boy. For the next 4 weeks, my wife did not let any of my family visit our son. Her mother and sister came over several times a week.\n\nMy wife refuses to let my family see him because she doesn't want to play host. My family understands that being a new mom is stressful and they have no expectations of being treated like proper guests. I told her it's not fair that her family can come & go as they please but my family can't even meet him. She said her family comes over to help her, which is not really true, they just hold the baby a little and if the baby isn't sleeping then I am the one taking care of him while they are here. They don't clean or anything, at most they might bring some takeout on the way over.\n\nFinally I decided I will be taking the baby to see my parents last weekend. My wife doesn't breastfeed so I got all the formula and diapers and everything I would need for a couple days and packed a bag. I thought this was a win-win because my wife could have some time to herself or come along and she would be under no pressure to host anyone. But she got mad when I told her what I would do but I told her this was happening, I am the baby's father and my family has a right to see him just as hers does. She refused to come along and said she can't believe I'm treating a new mother this way.\n\nI left on Friday evening and didn't hear anything from my wife on Saturday, but her sister & mom were over & sent a bunch of texts basically accusing me of \"abusing\" a new mother. Finally on Sunday she started sending me text after text on how I was a terrible husband, how I kidnapped her son, how a baby can't be separated from its mother, etc. It got so bad that I cut my visit short and drove home.\n\nShe was very mad when I got home and refusing to speak to me. The next day when the baby was asleep I sat her down and tried to calmly explain to her that I am the FATHER of the baby so I have as much right to where he goes and who he sees as she does, we are equal parents and she needs to accept reasonable compromises when we disagree, like my family being able to see our son and she not having to host them. She called me an asshole and shouted that she gets more say because she's the one who was pregnant with him.\n\nAt that point I said if she thinks that way & the accusations she texted me, I think she really needs to see a doctor and get assessed for PPD because her behavior is not normal. She called me an AH and said I was abusing my position as the earner (money was never part of any discussion). She has been giving me a near-silent treatment all week, resisting any attempts to discuss therapy, and her sister has texted me saying I should apologize to her for what I said. I told her sister that I had said absolutely nothing wrong in response to being accused of kidnapping and being a lesser parent to MY son.\n\nI am standing my ground but I need an outside perspective, AITA?\n\nEDIT: To clarify, the idea my wife might have PPD did not occur to me until after the visit with my family.\n\nEDIT 2: My wife knew of my plan to visit my family several days in advance. I planned a weekend trip because they are several hours away.\n\nEDIT 3: I want to emphasize this because people keep asking about it. **I DID NOT WANT TO SEPARATE MY SON FROM HIS MOTHER. I WANTED HER TO COME WITH US. SHE REFUSED.** I did not forcibly take my son away from her. It was her decision not to come along and her decision not to allow my family to come to her.\n\nEDIT 4: My wife is not physically handicapped from childbirth. She has been mobile and going out including a 6 hour car ride 2 weeks ago.\n\nEDIT 5: My wife refused any options involving my family coming to us. No hotel or in-town visits.",

In every person with a uterus is an ovary. That ovary releases an egg. Sometimes, if that person is fertile, they can get pregnant. No, they won't just conjure the child into their uterus. That's not how science works, you can't magic a baby into the uterus. What you need is someone with sperm. Working sperm. Both people need to be fertile in order for this work. Person with sperm will either offer their sperm in a cup or they will create a child the old fashioned way, penis in vagina. When that fated sperm makes it to the egg, it implants into the egg and then life could very well be on its way. Notice how you need sperm AND an egg in order to make a baby? You don't have to like it but cis men and other people with penises are also essential in making a baby. Without sperm, there is no life to be made. You can't magic a baby into the uterus. Repeat this until you get it. You can't magic a baby into the uterus, you need sperm. \n\nLet's not pretend that men don't do anything. I get most are just sperm donors even if they did PiV but you can't let your own daddy issues and hatred for cis men get in the way of unbiased opinions. I don't like cis men either, my own dad wasn't around until I turned 18. But this isn't a case of a dad being a deadbeat. He's actually there for his kid and wants to be there. He also wants to be an EQUAL parent. If you're a \"feminist\" you should be all over this. I'm an actual feminist, I care about equality for ALL genders (or non genders (; ). Female, male, nonbinary, genderfluid, etc. That means I will 100% advocate for men to be equal partners and fathers. Because that's what everyone should want. If you're in my replies, implying men shouldn't get equal say in how his biological child should be raised, you should refrain from speaking to me. I don't wanna hear your selfishness and hatred for a person you literally don't even know. You know this dude off of ONE post. ONE SINGULAR MOMENT IN HIS LIFE. If you are seriously advocating for this man to be a second class citizen and not get any say in his child's care, you need to seek therapy and possibly some higher education because wow.

This one is beyond reddit's paygrade. \n\nAnd to your in-laws, if they are criticizing you, ask them how they would feel if you had barred them from coming to visit - wouldn't they find that unnecessary and unfair? Maybe even controlling and disrespectful? Tell them you wouldn't do that, you just want both sides of the family treated the same. It's true your wife did the 'heavy lifting' when it came to carrying the kid. During pregnancy and immediately after birth, I do think the mother's wishes should take priority since she's the one who went through a major medical event, but it's over a month later and it's high time everyone understand that you're just as much a parent (and your family are just as much allowed to see him) as she is.",

That\u2019s honestly the only factor I can think of that might make her be acting like this other than the fact that overall her behavior is coming off as someone who is starting to become abusive.\n\nHer refusal to even allow your family to visit town at all is worrisome, and *comes off as her trying to isolate you from your family* and keep them away from the baby possibly permanently. **This is not normal behavior for a new mother, but it is normal behavior for an abuser trying to cut their victim off from sources of help**. Her telling you that you don\u2019t get any say at all over who visits your home, or sees your baby is not normal (literally unless your family or others you want to meet the baby are a bunch of child abusers there\u2019s no reason to keep them from seeing the baby - and nothing you\u2019ve said indicates that they are this, it\u2019s just the most *extreme example* tbh).\n\nHer refusal to even speak to a doctor about not wanting your family to visit or get accessed for PPD is also very worrisome. People who go through PPD are sometimes in denial of it. BUT, I will be completely honest, giving you *the silent treatment*, *refusing to take your legitimate concerns seriously*, and *getting her sister to text you that you\u2019re in the wrong and need to apologize and bend to your wife\u2019s whim* are all things that someone will do *at the beginning of a relationship that is or has become abusive* and not normal for someone dealing with PPD. You said in a comment that *\u201dshe\u2019s the one who wanted to have a baby\u201d*, that also pushes me to believe that this might be an abusive relationship too. Her accusing you of abusing her by taking your son to meet his extended family is her projecting. Her having her mother and sister - aka her flying monkeys - text you and accuse you of abusing her by letting your family meet your son is definitely projection. **She literally harassed you and guilted you into cutting your visit with your family short**. \n\nBeing the one who carried the child doesn\u2019t give you more say in who gets to see the baby. Unless there is an *actual valid reason* to not want your family there she needs to let her in laws, **the baby\u2019s extended family** see him. This genuinely just sounds like a poly to attempt to strain your communication with your family in order to isolate you.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA and your wife sounds like she\u2019s showing you who she really is now that you\u2019re essentially \u201ctrapped\u201d with her via a child.\n\nI know this take might come off as an extreme  take honestly, but the more I looked back at your post, and the more comments I read about her refusal to make *any compromise* that wasn\u2019t complete alienation of your family in regards to the baby (and by extension you, because god forbid you leave the *\u201dpoor new mother alone to fend for herself and the baby\u201d*), the more this comes off as attempts to isolate you from seeing your family, and attempts to keep your son from knowing his father\u2019s side of the family. I can almost guarantee that if you had visited your family *without the baby* you would have received just as many texts about \u201cabusing a new mother\u201d because you \u201cleft her alone with the baby\u201d.",

But I have other questions:   \n(1) Okay, she didn't agree to the family visiting and staying at a hotel. She also didn't agree with him taking the baby away for a weekend. Why wouldn't that more reasonable compromise of a brief visit with them staying at the hotel be the one he insists on rather than driving the baby 10 hours for a weekend trip? The logic is very \"well, she didn't agree to splitting the $10 prize with me, so I had to take $20 from her.\"  \n(2) I would like more info about the family visiting and staying in the hotel. Having your family come over for a couple of hours is one thing. In my family, when people tend to visit from out of town, they tend to hang around your house even when they are staying at a hotel. I would definitely be concerned about that. In which case her concerns about having to host them make sense.  \n(3) It doesn't seem like OP has really communicated with his wife about this--he doesn't really seem to know what she's feeling and why. It's weird. Usually with a situation like this we would hear the spouse give more info on the other spouse.\n\nAll in all, it's kinda weird and seems like information is missing.",

Because, like you pointed out, it's pretty common even when staying in a hotel to spend the majority of your time at the person's house for whom you traveled. \n\nSo, assuming the above is accurate, going to his parents, so that they're then the hosts, takes the issue of hosting off of the wife entirely - no surprise pop-ins and \"we didn't want to be stuck in the hotel with just the bed and an uncomfortable chair\" -  and allows her to just relax and be a guest while his parents dote on all three of them.",

Classic \u201cyou can be right and still be an asshole\u201d situation, imho. She is clearly in the wrong here. You\u2019re right, you don\u2019t need permission. However, I think the attitude you\u2019re coming at this from is rooted in bitterness + hurt that is leading to an overly legalistic concern with fairness and who has the right to do what, to both of y\u2019all\u2019s detriment.\n\nI think it is pretty clear there might be something going on with your wife mental health-wise. I know you said you didn\u2019t realize that before you left. That\u2019s okay, you realize now. In light of this information, separating her from the child for multiple days was not the compassionate, empathetic, or healthy thing to do in this situation. By doing that, you made a bad situation worse. \n\nAnd before people say \u201cshe\u2019s not being compassionate to him, why should he have to be to her?\u201d - they\u2019re married! He loves her! This isn\u2019t about some \u201cmotherhood pass\u201d to act however she wants, for all y\u2019all twisting yourselves in hysterics over \u201canti-father bias.\u201d It\u2019s about recognizing that she is wrong, she is currently failing on some level, AND treating her with support and compassion. Sometimes in a relationship with someone we love, I think we should act with greater grace than they necessarily \u201cdeserve\u201d from a tit-for-tat situation. If its always one party being graceful for the other one, then that\u2019s a problem, but I think digging into your empathy reserves here will go a long way. I know you\u2019re tired and confused and probably emotional right now. It sucks to have to be the strong one. But I think for the long-term good of your marriage, treating this situation with love and forgiveness and recognizing your wife is struggling and not her best self rn is the best option. \n\nTLDR: I don\u2019t think lawyering his POV and continuing to dig his heels in about whether he was justified to take the baby is the best move here, for the best outcome for BOTH of them. I think the focus needs to be on getting wife help and making her feel listened to in the moment. \n\nGood luck man, sorry you\u2019re in this situation.",
