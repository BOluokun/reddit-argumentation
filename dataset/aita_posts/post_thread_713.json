  "post content": "The ex and I divorced last year and the divorce decree states she gets to claim the kids which I agreed to. She refused to get a job until October (child support and free rent at her mom's was enough for her) and it was a part time job. Now it's time to file taxes and I owe $1700 which sucks. I asked her since she's barely going to get anything back if we can have me claim the kids as dependents (she'll still get the earned income credit) and I would pay her half of whatever I save by doing so.\n\nShe rejected that offer and when I pressed why she would throw money away she told me she's going to let her mom claim the kids so that way she can get all the tax savings from her mom in cash. I told her if she did that I would claim the kids too and let the IRS decide. I told her if she tries to backdoor this and I win I'm not giving her any of my tax savings. However, we could come to an agreement now and split it 50/50. Am I an asshole for thinking that since she's not claiming the kids like the divorce decree states that I shouldn't be next in line? \n\nSome context:\n\nI'm active duty and overseas so I can't have the kids outside of summer. I am officially the non-custodial parent but joint legal custody. I'm up to date on child support and never have been behind. She may have paid her mom rent with child support. Either she did and her mom didn't provide much financial support at all, or she didn't and she's been receiving free rent which isn't currently in the child support calculation and I'm not pressing it. I have offered her financial advice during the divorce and even gave her half of a bonus while officially separated without her even asking for it because I thought it was the right thing to do.\n\nTL:DR, don't blame you, I wouldn't want to read it either... But I'm living it... So help, anyone?",

If her mother isn't a primary caretaker for the children, then she may not be able to claim them as dependents. However that is for a court to decide and you need to figure out if that's worth the effort.\n\nIn any event, if you also disregard the divorce decree as you are suggesting in your post, then ESH.\n\nRemember that you put yourself in a stupid position by disregarding legal mandates.

Your divorce decree doesn't specifically account for this situation because neither one of you are technically providing more than 51% of the children's upkeep/housing/etc. You're going to have to talk to a lawyer if you want to know your exact rights here. It's up to you if you think paying the lawyer's fees is worth any money you may or may not get.\n\nAnd do NOT double claim those kids because you do NOT want to play games with the IRS. Given how understaffed the IRS is, it might take a couple of years to get through everything involved, including the audits of past files that they can (and usually do) require. And you can absolutely be penalized financially / legally if the IRS determines you purposely claimed something you aren't entitled to because that's fraud. Source: My sister went through this with her AH ex. Took her 2 damn years to resolve the issue the first time he did it, which means she didn't get that tax return until well after she needed it.

It doesn't matter how much you spend, what matter more is custody.  If your ex's mother is supporting her or and the kids, she could get deductions for having an adult dependent.  Its been a while since I had a tax class, but if she provides over 50% of your wife's living expenses and is a blood relative, this is easy to do and it means that you wife cannot claim dependent since she herself is one.  Which might be why she is having her mom claim them.",
