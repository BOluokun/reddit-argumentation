  "post content": "My wife and I have a six month old baby girl. She's mostly a SAHM, she works two half days a week and her sister watches the baby. I work full time and go to school one day a week. We've always had an arrangement where she takes care of the household duties (cooking, cleaning, and now baby care) while I happily support her monetarily. Honestly, we are both living our dream life and my wife does an absolutely spectacular job taking care of me and our little one.\n\nOn the weekends, we share baby duty. We usually make sure each of us gets our own alone time to do whatever we want. However, our girl has hit a bit of a sleep regression, waking up every two hours--since my wife breast feeds, she's always taken care of the baby full time overnight. She's a light sleeper and unfortunately has insomnia, whereas I am a deep sleeper and wouldn't wake up for baby cries anyways .\n\nRecently my wife has been asking me to wake up with the baby both days on the weekends so she can get an extra hour of sleep. Baby wakes up around 7am. I get the baby dressed and take over for that hour.\n\nBut sometimes, I want to be the one that gets to sleep in an extra hour. I brought this up to her and she says while she's happy to let me nap during the day, she really needs that hour bc she can't nap like I can. We got into an argument about it, and she said I'm being very insensitive when I know she is very exhausted and cant nap during the day and she struggles going back to sleep every time the baby wakes up. But I'm exhausted too, work wears me out, and school days are long... and I sometimes want the hour in the morning. I don't want to spend my off time napping, I want to play videogames and chill out.\n\nI've gotten mixed opinions on who is in the wrong here, or if there even is anyone in the wrong. AITA for asking us to share mornings off for sleep?",

I have done both sides: working full time and being a SAHM for an infant and I can assure you, the SAHM job is 20 times more exhausting.  I also nursed my baby and he was very colicky so he nursed every 2 hrs in the night and didn't nap in the day.  I was totally exhausted as I'm sure your wife is. You try getting up every 2 hrs every single night for a week then stay up all day for 1 week then come back and tell us you deserve to sleep in over your wife.  You should be getting up both mornings and give Jr a bottle so your wife gets to sleep until 10 or 11am. Then when she takes Jr, you should race to the kitchen and cook her breakfast. \n\nI guess everyone knows how I'm voting but just to formalize it YTA!!",

If he still thinks his video game time takes priority over having a more rested wife - which is better for her health, physically and mentally - then he needs to grow up.

Chronic sleep deprivation is no joke. Do you really want the person who is home alone with your child all day to be on the brink of a physical or mental crisis? I am sure she is a wonderful person who would never usually be reckless or cruel, but this scenario is how babies get smothered when mom passes out on the couch, or shaken, or have the house burn down around them because she fell asleep while cooking, or get into car accidents, etc etc. Sounds like you are getting a good night's sleep every night, when is the last time she got one? Probably sometime back in her early second trimester, if she was lucky. YTA, and your wife is never going to forget how you didn't have her back during this extremely difficult time.",

There is a pretty large portion of the population who uses video games to \u201crelax\u201c but a lot of video games are not meant to actually be terribly relaxing. \n\nGames are designed to maximize the time you play them. Many dole out accomplishments (aka dopamine hits) gradually and sparingly. You are intended to grind on them for a while to make progress (looking at you, Elden Ring.) Others are nominally shorter because there are defined bouts, like Fortnight and it\u2019s ilk, but they also require major time to develop skills. There is no \u201cceiling\u201d to how good you need to get because there is always another skill tier above you, up to pro. Also, even if you are comfortable with the tier you are in, like a slot machine the game is designed to keep you coming back. The wins and losses are often by a hair, so if you lose it\u2019s tempting to try \u201cjust once more\u201d so you don\u2019t end with a disappointment.\n\nAs a parent, what you need is efficiency. You need to relax, but you need to spend a short amount of time doing it, and you need to be positive that the relaxation is going to come at the end of it. So a game where you feel frustrated because you didn\u2019t get much done, or a game where you can end on a loss, is a really bad fit.",

Half the time my husband would be the one to get out of bed, but I'd be laying there thinking, \"is he getting up? Or should I? Who has done it more?\" And then when he did get up, I'd lay there and think, \"I feel guilty now that he's up, maybe I should have done it.\" And I wouldn't get back to sleep until he returned to bed. It was awful. But once we had shifts, I could open one eye, check the clock, go \"not my problem\" and fall immediately back to sleep. We both got significantly more sleep when we knew what was expected of us then when we tried to avoid hard schedules. \n\nWhen you have a very limited amount of time and energy and a LOT to do, you're in a constant mental battle of \"what should I be doing right now?\" Which means you can never truly relax.

Cherry on top was that my husband was in the military so we were 3000 miles from family and friends, I was completely on my own. Birthed my daughter alone while he slept and refused to wake up. The damage done to my brain is irreversible, I used to be witty and intelligent, read books and got straight A's. Now I can hardly string a sentence together without forgetting what I was saying, which is severely affecting my job. \n\nMy doctor actually ordered an MRI that showed severe, deep white lesions all over my brain which are common in severe PTSD/depression cases. I still can't drive on highways without having a panic attack because I fell asleep so many times while going 85mph down the road. Drove off the road a few times but thankfully never crashed into anything. My husband made me wake up every time with her even though she was mostly formula fed, I took her to and from daycare (which was on the military base he worked at), and he still played his video games in the evening after work. I stayed up past 2am most nights doing assignments for school. I am broken beyond repair and my daughter will never have a sibling because of it.",

Things kept getting worse where the only times she'd come out of her room were to start an argument, in front of the kids.

Get the papers and I'll sign.\" And here we are.\n\nNow they're 4 and 5 and we've had separate households for just over a year now!

This is supported by MANY studies, including:\n\nMen who share housework equally before having kids tend to suddenly start doing much less after their first child is born. \n\nMen stop doing housework to assert masculinity if their wife/gf starts earning more than them, even if it's bc he has no job. So the argument that women are expected to do more housework only bc men work more outside the home & women are expected to be the 1 to quit jobs & stay home with kids only bc men earn more...it's about fairness & just makes sense... not bc she's a woman...is BS!

But actually I think you are more than aware of it and are perfectly okay with being selfish so long as all your needs are met.\n\nAs a former breast feeding mother I completely understand where you wife is coming from. Her body aches, her hormones are out of whack, her nutrition might not be great, and she is exhausted mentally and physically. It is a kind of tired that you will never understand.\n\nYour wife need rest. She is verbalizing to you that she needs help. And she\u2019s not asking you to help by feeding the baby overnight with pumped breast milk. Because god forbid, you wake up in the night. She\u2019s simply asking you to let her catch up on the rest she\u2019s not getting right now.\n\nI don\u2019t think you can understand just how quickly someone can lose themselves when they become and mom and breast feed. Her entire existence has become 100% about someone else. And she does it every day. And she takes care of you. So who takes care of her? What will it take for you to realize she needs help since her asking for it didn\u2019t seem to be enough? \n\nIt\u2019s time to grow up. It\u2019s time to put the needs of your wife and baby ahead of your own because that is what it means to be a parent and a husband and an adult. Stop congratulating yourself for making your own lunches on occasion. Stop patting yourself on the back for giving her a break when you get home. A break that I am sure is really just her doing laundry, or cooking, or bathing. Those are not breaks. \n\nYour child deserves better from you. And your wife cannot be the parent she wants to be when she is exhausted and unsupported. This is how marriages end. Because she signed up to be your wife, not your mommy. \n\nTo put this into perspective for you, think of it this way. If your wife disappeared tomorrow, your entire life and home would be in shambles. If you disappeared tomorrow her life would be pretty much exactly the same except for that all important break when you get home from work. You shouldn\u2019t be okay with that kind of imbalance in your relationship. \n\nYTA.\n\nETA: wow thank you all for the awards, I\u2019ve never gotten one!
