  "post content": "Hello! First time poster here so sorry if it\u2019s not formatted like the usual posts on here. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I are expecting our first child together. We thought it would be fun to go with the new tradition of having a gender reveal for our baby. I am currently 17 weeks and plan on having the gender reveal when I am 22 weeks. \n\nWe told our family with the cute gestures you see all on social media now of days. And immediately my mom offered to plan the gender reveal and baby shower. At first I thought this was a great idea so it\u2019s less stress on me and I figured my mom would have my best interest in mind. My mom is also financially well off mind you. I agreed to this but at the planning process has been going along things have been very stressful for me. \n\nFirst, she didn\u2019t like the venue I chose as she said it looked as if it were for a wedding and she began pushing for us to have a \u201cshotgun\u201d wedding. I declined after her number attempts of pushing it on me, my fianc\u00e9 and I aren\u2019t the traditional couple and want to enjoy our engagement rather than rushing. \n\nNext, the other venues we found weren\u2019t good enough for her. She said she thought they were in bad areas and didn\u2019t want to be \u201ccatfished\u201d as we couldn\u2019t see the venue until after booking. Which I understood. I sent her more places over the week and she kept saying they were too far from her (she lives around 1.5 hours away from me) and kept suggesting places in her area. I declined as I wanted the venue near me as I am pregnant and don\u2019t know how I will feel that week of pregnancy. \n\nNow, my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to just have the reveal at our home. We thought we can plan it the way we want without restrictions from a venue or having to get event insurance. We have a big family so this was many of the issues we ran into. \n\nMy mom scoffed at this idea and started sending me venues that began overwhelming me. I didn\u2019t reply and had my fianc\u00e9 speak to her so I wouldn\u2019t get emotional or say anything I regret. We met for brunch and I thought we were all on the same understanding that the event would be at our home. But after an hour, she text me asking if we are firm or if she can continue looking for places. I told her yes we are firm. She then text me lowering her original budget by over half! The event venue cost more than what she said she is willing to help with now. \n\nAm I the asshole if I ask her to not be apart of the process? How would you go about this? We both aren\u2019t able to afford to do a huge gender reveal without her money which sucks but I am tired of her attitude towards the planning process.",
