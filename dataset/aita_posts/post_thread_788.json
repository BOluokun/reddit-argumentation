  "post content": "So, my sister is one of the typical popular girls who just cares about what\u2019s trending, fashion stuff, her friends and how to maintain her popular image among her social circle. \n\nWe have the coronavirus pandemic going on in India and cases are rising rapidly. Also, there have been no social events/meet-ups this year. \n\nNow my sister wants to celebrate her birthday and invite 15-20 friends home. We have a basement that kind of sucks (not that good looking). She\u2019s planning to spend thousands of dollars on renovation, decoration and all sorts of things so that her *high-class* friends don\u2019t judge her or pity where she lives. \n\nShe wants everything to be perfect. Her birthday is a month away but all she talks about is how things are gonna be- what kind of food, a new chandelier, home theatre system etc. \n\nSo I lost my temper and gave her a piece of my mind. I told her she has not done anything worthwhile or ground-breaking in her life to be deserving such a grand birthday. Moreover, I told her to focus on her career and not these stupid functions to merely impress a few people that don\u2019t even care about us. \n\nAITA here?",

                      "content": "You're not wrong. The post does *not* say that random people would be coming and going. That is an assumption that I'm making based on OP's wording implying that the sister isn't the DIY type of she's so obsessed with her image. It also doesn't say that the sister would be doing the work herself. Both of us are making assumptions here. \n\nThe costs associated with renos and decorating are also highly dependent on location. Do I know how far you can get with 2k in India? Absolutely not. I do know how far you can get with that in the southern US though and to get everything picture perfect in a month would require multiple hands depending on how bad the room is to start with. If we're talking slapping on some fresh paint and getting new furniture, plenty easy. I'll give you that. But again, we don't know the extent of it.\n\nI hadn't seen anyone acknowledge that certain renovations come with new people entering the home (plumbers, delivery guys, carpenters, electricians, etc.) and those people will have likely just come from someone *else's* home, and so on. It's an unneeded risk for a birthday party in a pandemic. Partially because it is really unwise to *have* a party where you have guests that don't otherwise live with you.\n\nBut again, I also didn't say that OP was right either. Everyone involved did/is doing a dumb or mean thing. Hence, everyone sucks.\n\nQuick edit to say that to be honest and throw myself under the bus, I'm kindof bitter about parties right about now. I've missed not only my birthday, but my son's 1 year for the sake of trying to stay safe. It hurts, but it's better than potentially never getting to celebrate the next one. I live in an area where people have taken the \"it's no big deal\" stance and now we're getting overwhelmed by cases. Even though I've done my part since March, I'm still trapped because no one else wants to play by the rules.\n\nAlso adding that I didn't downvote you, nor do I totally disagree with you. There's honestly just not enough info and way too much to speculate on. This post is a giant Devil's Advocate paradise.",
