  "post content": "So, my brother is getting his diploma from university. 9 people and I wanted to buy him something nice. \n\nAfter 20 days, I decided to do a polling. 3 people voted for Playstation VR, 3 people voted for Remarkable 2, 2 people voted for a new phone and one persone voted for \"choose something else\".\n\nSo, to avoid being stuck, I asked the 2 people who voted for the phone to vote for something else. They voted for the VR. So, understandably, I bought the VR from Gamestop for $300. Mind that we need this before 2nd October.\n\nI thought that the VR would be a great gift for a gamer. I tried to understand whether he would actually like it or not, but it wasn't that obvious one way nor the other.\n\nHowever, two days later, the person who voted for \"choose something else\" wrote \"Are we really sure about the VR? Should we keep looking for something else just in case?\".\n\nNow everybody is unsure about the VR and I look like an a-hole. I almost got a VR in my house and nobody really wants it.\n\nI am stuck like this. I think I could have got the gift a bit later, but how was I supposed to know?\n\nTL;DR: 5 out of 9 people agreed to buy a VR for my brother's diploma. 2 Days later, after I bought the gift, turns out nobody wants the VR to be the gift. \n\nAm I the asshole here?",

You really did this to yourself by deciding 5 out of 9 was good enough. \n\nHonestly I think you managed this group gift really poorly and the rest of the group aren\u2019t AHs for questioning it, especially since the person who brought up the concern never agreed to the item in the first place. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH but I do think you could have done this better NAH",
