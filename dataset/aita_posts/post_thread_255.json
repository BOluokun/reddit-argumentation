  "post content": "I (28M) am an only child. When I was 12 my parents divorced when my dad found out my mom cheated on him. This was devastating to my dad. My parents were best friends and started dating when they were 17. I played sports and my dad was my coach so I had a much closer relationship to him then my mom. I was suppose to spend one week at my moms then the next week at my dads. But I would usually just lock myself in my room at my moms. Usually my dad would drop me off and I would get on my bike and ride the couple miles back to his house. My mom would ask me things and I would literally pretend like she didn\u2019t exist. It got so bad that lawyers got involved thinking my dad was turning me against my mom. My dad encouraged me to spend time with my mom, but I couldn\u2019t. My mom tried putting us in therapy but I would just sit there till the time was up not saying a word to her. Eventually my mom broke down and let me just live with my dad. \n\nI haven\u2019t spoken a word to my mom in 15 years. She would show up to my games alone. Sometimes I would ask my dad to tell her to leave. Sometimes I didn\u2019t even notice she was there. She would try talking to me after and I would walk right past her. I cut her whole family off besides a few of my cousins that were around my age. She showed up to my high school graduation and I asked a couple teachers to remove her and they did. She never dated anyone else to my knowledge and was still attempting to reconcile with my dad a few years before he passed. Calling it the \u201cbiggest mistake of her life\u201d and begging my dad to forgive her. When my dad passed a couple years ago she tried to show up to the funeral and I met her outside to ask her to leave. My fianc\u00e9 Rachel was with me when I did this and my mom cried upon learning we were engaged (Rachel introduced herself as my fianc\u00e9). Saying she couldn\u2019t believe I hated her still this many years later. \n\nSo last week I received a letter from my mom with a large check inside. In the letter she said she couldn\u2019t live knowing she wouldn\u2019t be invited to her only child\u2019s wedding. That her whole family is hurt that I cut them off. And that she had been keeping tabs on me all these years through my cousins updates out of respect for me, but couldn\u2019t handle not being at the wedding. I ripped the check up and sent it back to the return address. She shouldn\u2019t have even known my address as I keep her blocked on all social media. I called up my cousins who admitted that since I was 14 they have been providing my mom with updates on me. Prom pics, college updates, engagement photos and they sent her my address. I was so mad that I told them they wouldn\u2019t be invited to the wedding anymore because I don\u2019t want my mom getting access to it. Rachel is saying I\u2019m going too far now and uninviting my cousins along with freezing out my moms whole family because of her actions is an AH move. AITA?\n\nEdit: the cheating was with a teammates dad. This was highly embarrassing for me and caused me to have to move towns. Caused me to loose friends.",

Look at it this way, if a man hit his wife and she leaves him, but his family keeps telling him where she's at, people would have no problem seeing the family's betrayal. But because what the Mother did was emotional and not physical people keep downplaying it. Cheating and affairs are traumatic. Not just for the spouse but the children too. He decided he didn't want to be around the type of person his mother is and nobody wants to respect that. Good for him for cutting them off.

Then he got cancer and had a couple months left to live. The kid (now in mid 30s) gave him a chance to reconcile and found out his Dad grew up a lot. They had a lot in common, his new wife (the step mom) was amazing, and he enjoyed spending time with his Dad. He spend basically every day until his dad died with him, watching sports and hanging out. Then said if he could do anything to go back and give him the chance to reconcile earlier he would. It was a really sad story. I am kinda butchering it because I am give the TLDR for something i read 5 years ago but the message is what matters.  Holding onto hate doesn't help anyone and only hurts you and the people around you. \n\nOP should take notes from that guys experience. Imagine how different you were just 5 years ago, this was 16 years ago. Your mom is a completely different person. Don't wait till her death bed to find out she might have been worth giving a second chance. YTA",

No one says you ever have to forgive your mother for what she did. But you\u2019re taking it out on her entire family, and that\u2019s just wrong. Listen to your fianc\u00e9\u2026 she sees how unhealthy holding onto such hatred for your mother is for you. \n\nWhatever you decide to do, best of luck to you.

              "content": "I've given this a lot of thought, and I feel like a lot of the votes in favor of him being the AH here are a bit misguided/empathizing with the wrong person. I will say, I do agree with the fact that he needs therapy, and that amount of cortisol (which is what will happen from this level of anger) isn't healthy. But all that said, I don't blame him for that.\n\nI get feeling sorry for the mother who so obviously feels bad about what she's done. Really, I do. But I don't think his actions are indicative of a lack of empathy for his mother so much as unresolved hurt from the domino effect her actions had on him. In fact, I think it's pretty clear this is the result of trauma. Like, apathy is the opposite of empathy, really. But he so clearly still cares, or he wouldn't be so angry.\n\nPeople are defending the fact that it wasn't his business, and that she's allowed to have flaws. And yes, she is. But there is a consequence/outcome for every single thing we do, sometimes positive, sometimes negative. She made her bed, and found out it was broken in more than one place. It sucks, but this is the consequence for her actions.\n\n& for the record, to all the people who say it isn't his business--it absolutely IS his business. He's obviously been traumatized by this series of events--trauma explains the ability to hold onto such anger for such a long time. Children aren't stupid--it's pretty clear they can pick up on stuff from family members. The best intending parents will do everything in their power not to let it impact the kids, but sometimes it's just inevitable.\n\nEven if his father was hurt more, in theory, by his mother's actions--clearly there have been side effects that have occurred outside of that one instance. Bullying is no joke, and it's no surprise that he holds her responsible as the reason it happened. I mean... had she not cheated, then the circumstances might have been different. Also, just because his father took the brunt of the initial pain, doesn't mean he didn't also experience his own horrible pain. Since when is it a competition? No two people have the same threshold for the same types of pain. We're all different.\n\nRegarding the cousins and his mother--\n\nEven in the absence of specific instructions not to keep his mother updated on him with his sometimes public, sometimes private information... I feel like they are paying a price for their own actions, too. You wouldn't have to tell me not to give updates to someone who hurt you and you decided to go no contact with. It's blatant disregard for his **very clearly implied** boundaries, and it's betrayal. You're basically saying you feel worse for the aggressor than the victim, if you're willing to prioritize the aggressor's wants over the victims. Even if it doesn't seem fair, that was NOT their call to make. I'm really not sure how people are justifying this.\n\nThey got involved--in the mother's favor, and now people are like surprised pikachu face that there are consequences for that.\n\nFinally, I really don't think people are being fair here regarding how he's treating his mother. He has made his choice. She has time and time again not respected it. She needed to write him a letter that expresses how sorry she is, that if the OP is ever willing to reconcile she is willing and ready and then let the ball be in his court. Then, she needed to leave him the f alone. Why is everyone glossing over this? Even if she has good intentions, she's still dismissing someone she hurt in favor of what feels best for her. She tried to bribe him with money. Hello?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I were being generous, I'd say NAH because I don't think, despite everything I said, that there were any *intended* AH here. But truthfully, I don't think it's much of a stretch to say that blatantly disregarding OP's wants in favor of the mother is a bit of an AH thing to do by his cousins, and an AH move by his mother not to respect his choice, no matter how sorry she is. Ultimately, what would make OP the AH is if he was the instigator. But he isn't. He is reactionary.",

(\"Having experienced abuse\" and \"being able to understand and articulate what happened\" are two different things.)

We lived in a small town so pretty quickly a lot of people knew. Then he started showing up to my events, sports games, etc. and I repeatedly told him not to because I needed time and space and it was a huge distraction emotionally and mentally. And like OP's mom, he never backed off, no matter how many times I asked or ignored him or told him I needed space. And you know what? I did not feel loved at all, I felt like what I wanted and needed didn't matter, because it really was more about him doing what he felt was \"right.\" People in his side of the family constantly told me I needed to get over it, forgive, and value that \"you only get one father,\" but that didn't make any of that happen and didn't lessen all the messed up things that *I knew* but other family didn't. Kids need to feel like their wants and needs are valued and I don't see where that ever happened for OP. I get the sense that OP's hurt is more than just \"this messed up parts of my life\" and more \"I had needs and wants and they didn't matter to all these people. I had all these feelings and they didn't matter to people. My mom did this, it messed up my life, it hurt, and after all that, it's more about what she wants than what I want.\" It seems like the frustration of constantly having that need for time and space violated, ignored, and dismissed is the root of OP's anger. Does therapy seem necessary? Absolutely.

And that's *why* it was so traumatic for OP.\n\nMom killed their family.\n\nHe had 12 years growing up in a single household, with two loving parents.  But - and this was almost certainly an ABRUPT shift - suddenly mom and dad are broken.  Suddenly someone's moving out and getting their own place.  Suddenly, the kitchen table will not have the same people sitting around it anymore.  Or ever again.\n\nIn pediatrics, we EXPECT parental divorce to be traumatic.  Not as traumatic, perhaps, as a parent dying or going to jail, but it's still a usually permanent schism through the very heart of the only world the kid has ever known.\n\nI agree that OP is punishing his mother far more than most children of adulterers blame their parents, when it results in divorce.  No one can deny that!  But he has a *reason* to.  His life was never the same again (not to mention he actually had to move on top of that, so goodbye rest of your support network).\n\nSometimes, a mistake causes damage you cannot fix, no matter how badly you want to.  That's reality.  It really sucks when you wish more than anything you could take it back, but it is life.\n\nNone of this means I don't empathize with mom.  I'm actually empathizing with her MORE than with OP right now!  My blood is actually running cold this minute at imagining being in a similar situation, where I do something unforgiveable and my husband leaves me forever, and I know that by my own actions I will never have him back.  Thank goodness that's fictional.  My heart breaks for mom, who very obviously has repented, but she can only ask for forgiveness - not demand it.  We can empathize with both sides here, and acknowledge the tragedy, without casting blame for the fact the damage was permanent.\n\nIt also doesn't mean therapy isn't a good step.  /u/lightbright123, you got a raw deal here, and I'm sorry.  NTA because your cousins were definitely out of line for their actions, but that's  whole 'nother kettle of fish that I don't really want to get into.  What I do want to say - it sounds like you may not yet have been guided in fully processing the trauma.  Very, very few people would be able to deal with something that horrible on their own, but if you didn't engage with your therapy, that's essentially what you did.  It's also not a bad idea, as you take the exciting first step to building your own family (congratulations!!!), to explore how your beliefs about family may have been altered by the divorce.  You DO have a responsibility to make sure that your suffering and anger do not afflict your wife or future children.",

And while it hurts my heart for her, she is in the wrong for not respecting his decision. \n\nAnd yes, thank you for saying this. I think the trauma was also heavily compounded by the bullying he got, on top of the divorce at a young age. I also think that it will be his responsibility to go to therapy, so that he doesn't negatively impact other people (like his fiance or future children) because of how this trauma has impacted him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill, I just logically think that he's NTA here.",

He was cheating on my mom, projected on her violently, and then only showed up to rub his affair partner in her face. Leading to my mom's suicide. He even brought his girlfriend (recently upgraded to fiancee) to my mom's funeral.

I wasn't wanted by my step mother and she abused my sister enough to give her PTSD, then convinced my father to kick her out at 13. Then she turned to me to shit on until I went NC as soon as I moved out. My dad pretended nothing was wrong with how I was raised.

Had to move, lost friends\u2026 the affair was with the father of one of OP\u2019s teammates, that must have placed OP in the middle of a lot of it (not between OP\u2019s parents, but between the families involved). If they had to change schools, it must have been pretty significant. So, they exerted control the only way they could \u2014 by distancing mom\u2026 and mom didn\u2019t give OP space, didn\u2019t let OP make any of the decisions. She kept on showing up, pressuring OP to forgive her. I\u2019m sure she thought she was doing the right thing, but in not giving OP time, she prevented OP from feeling they had any agency at all; the only thing they could control was whether or not they spoke, and even that she tried to push OP to do on her timeline. Adolescence is a time kids really need to be getting *more* agency, I don\u2019t doubt it was especially challenging developmentally to instead lose agency. \n\nAnd now they found out that even what agency they thought they had wasn\u2019t real. These cousins \u2014 the only maternal family they thought they could trust \u2014 were sharing information with their mom the whole time. It would be one thing if their father had said \u201cShe\u2019s your mother, she should have this information,\u201d but their cousins were some of the only people they trusted, and weren\u2019t the right people to make that decision.\n\nIdk, if I were in OP\u2019s shoes I suspect I would uninvite the cousins too. It\u2019s not about whether OP\u2019s reaction was proportionate back then, it\u2019s that OP\u2019s trust was repeatedly violated and they don\u2019t want to have to worry about that during their wedding. \n\nI\u2019m also baffled by people saying mom didn\u2019t cheat on OP; indirectly, she did. In cheating on her husband she was also betraying her family more broadly. She wasn\u2019t acting in OP\u2019s best interests, which is a parent\u2019s primary job. Her actions affected everything in OP\u2019s life. I would argue that OP was more of a victim of her actions than their father was. I agree that OP should get into therapy, I agree that aspects of their responses have been disproportionate, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t pretend that OP\u2019s father was the only real victim of the affair. While mom was off having an affair, she was actively deciding that having some fun on the side was more important than OP\u2019s needs. \n\n(And disclaimer in advance since mine seems to be an unpopular opinion: no, I\u2019ve never been cheated on, done the cheating, or had a parent cheat. And no, I don\u2019t work with any sort of divorce-related anything. I\u2019m not projecting, I\u2019m just thinking about this from a developmental psychology perspective and baffled by how people can treat OP like they were a barely-affected bystander.)",

Seriously, are they really suggesting that the cheating only affected his father?

His father is his coach, so I imagine he spends a great deal of his time with his father, probably more than most of us ever have. \n\nEverybody knows the bond that sports create, especially between father and son, so you go and sleep with your son's teammate's father? \n\nCan you imagine the period between finding out about it and them moving, if his mother kept showing up to his games, the environment that it must have created? How was he not going to walk past her? Did she really expect him to side with her in front of everyone? \n\nI mean, I don't want to pass any judgement, but at some point, you have to see it from that perspective, I think it's a valid one.\n\nAnd that's just one part of it. Now this child's life has literally been uprooted, and has to go perpetually back and forth between mom and dad, as a collateral of this tug of war just because it didn't work out between them. \n\nI just think that children are often treated as collateral when it comes to divorces, and people tend to underestimate the effect that separation can have on their lives. Honestly, I think it's a huge deal and it lends to the following debate:\n\nWhich is more important?\n\nThe child's right to have a functional family? Or the parents' right to find their happiness regardless of the circumstances?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's like that scene in Pulp Fiction, Vincent says \"well, you play with matches, you get burned\", then Jules says \"you don't think he overreacted?\" \n\n*\"Antoine probably didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but, he had to expect a reaction\"*\n\nI think it's hard to say if OP overreacted or not, because it's a difficult situation by nature, and everyone reacts to it differently, but I also think it sounds condescending to minimize the impact that it actually had on OP by pretending nothing happened and carrying on when everyone around you knows what happened.",

But even though we had the same thing happen you are still 100% the asshole. \n\nYou see, you never grew up, you never learned, you never tried, you never healed. It's fucking hard healing from something like that but you just never tried and now you are filled with so much hate and disgust that this isn't healthy. I'm not gonna say \"make amends you only have one parent\" but do heal for yourself. If you both decide to have a relationship and try keep moving forward go ahead, but you gotta first fix your relationship here before you commit to one for maybe your whole life.\n\nFrom one broken individual to another, you need to do better for you.",

I did the same as op, ignore her, don't reach out and make her leave my events. I was hurt and didn't know how to cope with the hate from everyone and knowing I don't have a famiy.\n\nBut I did reach out when my sister got really sick, my mom couldn't even react or eat. So I reached out and helped her eat, get well and even thought I'm still hurt by everyone and everything I learned to cope. I might never be 100% ok with what she did or be 100% ok mentally.

My mum cheated on my dad and was generally shitty at times, but I've never harboured this kind of abject hatred for her. I feel really sorry for your mum to be honest. You went absolutely nuclear on her, and while no one can tell you that you have to repair the relationship, I think you need to do some work to figure out WHY you reacted that way. I think cheating is an awful and immoral thing to do, but I'd be wary of someone's emotional maturity if they continued to react this way.",

She didn't listen. His mom put them in GROUP therapy to try to fix his relationship with his mom (you really think OP is going to open up to a therapist IN FRONT OF HIS MOM about how he felt after defending his mom for months and finding out his mom lied and she really did cheat). \n\nMaye if OP had a year of NC, like this poster did, their relationship would have recovered. Instead, the family kept trying to push them together. OP is finally done.\n\nMaybe this is bad for OP's mental health, but OP is the judge of that - not you and not his mom.",

She actively encouraged us to see him as often as possible.  We went together to therapy as a family so that my sibling and I could process the end of their relationship. The way I saw and still do see it was that  if my mom, the person who knew him best and who was betrayed by him, is telling me that he is still worthy as a father then I'm going to believe her. \n\nI also wonder how OP's dad would have felt about him excluding her from the funeral. It sounds like they developed a cordial relationship and were still in contact. Theyd been together since the were teenagers, as had my parents.  I'm 45 now, they're both in their sixties and speak fondly of each other. I'm glad that my mom didn't allow me to blow up my relationship with my dad's entire family.",
