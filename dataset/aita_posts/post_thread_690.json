  "post content": "before i should tell there are some problems with my brain: concentration, writing, fine motor skills, social interactions, etc.\n\nthis resulted in a very rough childhood, particular school. My childhood was that bad, that when i had a pregnancy scare with my first GF I got a vasectomie and had me tested to be 100%. i will not pass on my gene\u2019s, it\u2019s running in the family and it\u2019s getting worse with every generation.\n\ni don\u2019t like to talk about that part of my life, but when my GF and me were talking about kids I told her, this is the first reason i definitely don\u2019t want a kid to go true wat i went true. the second is that i personally believe that there are too much humans on the plannet and we are sucking it dry from it resources in a exponential growing rate. my GF told me she understood, from time to time the kids topic passed and i remembered here at my standpoints.\n\npassed holidays we were invited at my in laws. my GF here sis has 2 kids and the 3th is on the way, in a result the conversation is about kids, than they question me specific, i tell them that kids are not for me, but they keep insisting i so explain my second reason. still they keep insisting, (like i\u2019m said i\u2019m not the best in social interaction) i said strongly there will be no grandkids from me and to drop it.\n\nMy GF start crying, and my mother in law tells me (in a not so nice way) my GF is pregnant. a normal person probably had seen thins coming form a miles away, but not me. I lost it completely\u2026 , I was already uncomfortable from being put on the spot but this \u2026\n\nI told them they could all die for my part, that i had a vasectomie, that i was clear from the start that i don\u2019t want kids, and that she can collect her stuf and i don\u2019t want to have anything to do with here. (the house were we live is mine).\n\nI did get tested for the 2nd time and the doctor told me there is no chance i\u2019m the father\n\nwell 10 days later, i feel like shit. my GF is the best thing ever happen to me, all our friends think that i\u2019m a dick, my own mother said that i reacted very poorly.. my GF probably didn\u2019t had the guts to tell me so she asked here mom, and my reaction is proof of that\u2026\n\nso internet i\u2019m I an asshole for how i reacted, ?\n\ni don\u2019t know i\u2019m totally lost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit:\n\ni assume she cheated, i didn't told her about the vasectomie. she never asked and when we started dating she was on the pill, I assumed she still is/was",
