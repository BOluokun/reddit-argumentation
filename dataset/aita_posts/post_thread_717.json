  "post content": "My kids and husband are saying i was being a asshole/karen for being snarky and for quietly complaining to my family that the service sucked. What do yall think?\n\nWe went out to a late dinner at a all night breakfast place. The hostess asks us how many people and I tell her 4. She then turns toward the paper menus, licks her fingers and starts grabbing menus and counting them out. She turns back to me and asks do we need anything else. I told her some menus that didn't have her saliva all over them! We are in a global pandemic , you can't be doing stuff like that! \nThe hostess looked startled and a manager having seen her lick her fingers and heard my comment came running over and grabbed us new menus. A nearby waitress laughed out loud. \n\nWe were seated. Ordered quickly and when the food begins to come out , my daughter's meal is missing and none of the dressings are on the plates. The waitress asks if we need anything else. I just say, the missing meal, syrup, ketchup and ranch and we will be all good. \n\nThe waitress returns with ketchup and I again ask for ranch ,syrup and the missing meal. She returns with a cup of dipping sauce that I soon discover is tartar sauce. I flag her down again and again ask for ranch and tell her of the mistake.  She returns with the ranch. 20 mins later my last child gets her food. We ask for the check and to go containers. Having given up on syrup , we stole one from a departed table. She gives us the check but never gives us containers so we had to flag down the hostess from before. The hostess brings us the containers and tells me she's now wearing gloves and a mask and she's sorry about before. I just told her okay and turned into start packing up leftovers. \n\nSo Am I the asshole for being snarky and not thanking the hostess for putting on gloves and a mask?  We left a 15% tip and filed no complaints so I think I'm not the asshole.",
