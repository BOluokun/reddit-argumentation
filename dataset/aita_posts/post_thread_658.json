  "post content": "My best friend and I had opposite priorities during college. She was incredibly responsible and career-focused when we first met in college. She was a Resident Aide, did no partying, and focused on getting through nursing school\u2014 forfeiting any invitation to party or indulge in any standard early-20s debauchery. I was a fire-breathing hedonist.\n\nShe became a nurse at 22, shortly married her high school sweetheart, had a kid in our mid-20s, and second kid in our late-20s. I spent a majority of my 20s bartending/doing bottle service, and indulging in much of the life that comes with that.\n\nFlash forward to now (we are in our early 30s), she is divorced, and a single mother of two children. I, have barely established roots to my career but have grown so far from my former night-timing self, to a pretty disciplined adult. I don\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t party, I\u2019m in a healthy/stable relationship, in bed before 8:30, listen more and talk less\u2014 I am quite literally the opposite person I was in my 20s\u2014 a bore. For the past 5 years, I have always awoken at 3:30 am to go to the gym. More intently now, because I\u2019m training for an Ironman. (All of this she knows.)\n\nI feel like she\u2019s going through a weird Renaissance period\u2014 which, I understand a divorce may put you through. Any time we go out and she\u2019s without child(ren), she\u2019s always vying for attention from men. It makes me feel like those we\u2019re those pathetic old bags that are past their prime, hitting outside our weight class lol. It straight up makes me uncomfortable.\n\nSo, we got into a confrontation on the evening of her birthday. We were at dinner with our mutual best girlfriends and my bedtime was shortly approaching. As I announced my plan to leave, best friend proceeded to guilt me into staying as she wanted to have an impromptu night dancing at a nearby bar\u2014 \u201cfor old times sake.\u201d It did not help that our two other girlfriends (still stuck in their 20s), further goaded me, saying I sucked and was a killjoy. We got into it in front of everyone where I ended up giving her what sounded like a stern scolding from an angry parent to respect my boundaries and it should\u2019ve been enough that I came out this late already. It was just an awkward silence after I spoke, then bye.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s not like I started becoming like this overnight, I have always slept early and awaken even earlier. And I don\u2019t want to party anymore! Hang out with the other two to live out your 20s. 20s me was fun as hell at that time, but I could never go back to that, and I\u2019m sorry you straight up missed out. AITA for being a killjoy and not indulging her on this one day?",
