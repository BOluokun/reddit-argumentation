  "post content": "I (16 F) am a babysitter and I babysat for a family I have never babysat for before. They have a baby that\u2019s only a couple months old, a 4 year old boy & a 4 year old girl (and are paying me 12/hr) As you can imagine they are all on the smaller side and require lots of attention. when the parents were about to leave their friends came over and dropped of thier 4 year old. I am not getting paid extra and this was not communicated with me ahead of time. The parents brought her to me and said that she goes to bed at the same time as the others and gave me a quick smile before leaving. I babysat the kids for 6 hours. I was wondering if I should i bring it up to the parents or should i just let it go since it's only one extra kid? It just kinda seems unfair that there was no communication to me about it and im supposed to feed this extra kid, get her ready for bed, keep her entertained & put her to sleep. In the end i decided to do nothing about it and told myself that it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, my parents and friends have since said that i was being taken advantage of.. Yesterday the mother texted me asking if i would babysit for her kids again while she went out. I declined telling her that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable babysitting with her again because she didn\u2019t communicate with me last time and i felt blindsided. She snapped back by telling me that i was very rude and it was in the past. She said I should\u2019ve said something then and that it is my fault for not telling her how I felt. I feel really bad but my parents told me that she is trying to guilt trip me since I\u2019m only 16 and she thinks that she can. I haven\u2019t responded to her messages because I am unsure of if I am in the wrong. So am I the a hole here?",

You should have been paid more especially if you are caring for 3 kids. \\[in addition to having to babysit for a 4th unexpected child\\]. Shes the A for expecting you to babysit another kid and not communicating with you about it - big NO.\n\nDo NOT babysit for her. Do NOT let her guilt trip you. Do NOT tolerate her behaviour.\n\nIn the future, you shouldn't have to justify your reasoning as to why you can't babysit someone's children - eg. her children in this case. I feel like you should give her the reason of being uncomforable. Just tell her that you are unavailable. Block her number. \n\nI would also think about what prices you would charge for babysitting. I know that some people have a baseline price for 1 child and then an additional cost for multiple children (maybe a couple of dollars more added onto the baseline price per child\\] - this is completly up to you. For example maybe $12/hr for one child and then maybe a couple of more dollars \\[$2-5\\] extra per child.",

Which is actually an interesting insight, she did it to explain her side.  We say \"Eh, eat a dick!\" and don't even bother with the whole effort of getting into the why's and what for's and just politely dance around stuff to avoid the drama.  And then as we get more and more jaded, we're so used to \"politely\" dancing around shit that we go back to just blatantly saying what's on our mind and that's the ultimate sign of not giving a fuck anymore.\n\nFunny how the cycle goes full circle, innit?  I do think she genuinely thought these people might have the temerity to be ashamed of what they did though lol.  Lesson learned I suppose.  People can suck.  She did the right thing IMO, fuck em'.  Blatantly let them know what they did, and the only advice I have is to follow it up by blocking them and stick to the guns.  Took me until my 20s to start standing up for myself, so she done good!",
