  "post content": "I\u2019ve (M32) been with my girlfriend (F29) for over a year now. She\u2019s smart, funny, a bit quirky, and has a serious job with a good salary. We have a great time together and generally get along very well. The only thing is her choice in home \u2018decor\u2019 is bizarre, to put it frankly, and not something you think a normal, grown adult would be into. \n\nHer apartment is definitely a reflection of herself and interests. Not in the best way though. \n\nMy girlfriend has wall dedicated to animation in one room of her apartment, like Futurama pieces and etchings of some weird triangle guy. Then there\u2019s the wall of framed preserved insects in another room. But not insects like butterflies or moths. Instead she displays tarantulas, beetles, and large stick insects. Her bathroom has a subtle theme of the ocean-pretty common. But instead of starfish or shells, she has a little anglerfish nightlight, a small vampiric squid painting, and then a framed diagram of what apparently is a Goblin Shark right by the toilet. \n\nI would say a majority of her home decor and furnishings are okay. The apartment itself is very modern and sleek. It\u2019s just the random decor and juvenile-ish themes like cartoons, insects, and bizarre ocean creatures, is off putting.\n\nThis is where I might be the AH. I avoid bringing people over to her place, especially people from my job, because of how juvenile it looks. Everyone\u2019s impressed when they see the high rise, but that quickly fades once you enter. The one time I brought a work colleague over they ended up telling me after that they found her insect wall terrifying. I work in finance and appearances and first impressions are important.\n\nMy office will hold casual gatherings where we get together for a few drinks, good food, and we rotate hosts. And this time, it\u2019s my turn. The problem is my place is under some construction and not an ideal place to be right now, so I\u2019ve been staying with my girlfriend. My girlfriend suggested that we host my colleagues here since she has the space and thinks it\u2019ll be fun. I told her I planned on skipping my rotation and seeing if the next person would be okay with hosting early. She kept pressing on why I didn\u2019t want them over here, so I finally said it\u2019s because her home decor is strange and not something a grown woman would have, and also that her insect wall horrified the one colleague that did come over. \n\nMy girlfriend got mad and said at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my space and these things bring her joy. She also said that she is indeed an adult woman, which is exactly why her apartment is decorated in such a manner. \n\nI love my girlfriend, I do. And it\u2019s okay to have different interests. But does an adult really need to decorate with them besides a few things here and there? I mean, my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for telling my girlfriend her home decor is the reason I won\u2019t host a work gathering at her place?",

It's fine if you think her apartment's ambience isn't appropriate for a work event, but YTA for dating someone you don't actually like and then expecting them to dull who they are so your coworkers don't get the vapors. Yeah, I know you say you like her, and I'm sure you like her appearance and her money and her high-status building, but you clearly have nothing but disdain for her personality and interests. She doesn't have to beige herself down to satisfy your weird obsession with appearing \"adult\".",

The flat had two box rooms, my old flatmate and I used one for storage and one for a guest room and she'd initially sounded fine with that as a concept but on the second run it was all \"oh I think we'd need one each\". I'd previously expressed that the heating in the flat was a bit useless so I didn't bother putting it on very often - but she was welcome to as long as she paid more this became \"we'll see how it goes\".\n\nThe kicker though was the room had been advertised for one person or a couple, with the clear statement that if it was a couple although rent would still be split 50/50, all bills would be split 3 ways. She'd not mentioned a guy before but on the second visit was \"oh my boyfriend might want to move in in about 4 months\" - \"no bother, but bills will be split 3 ways\". Her response \"oh why don't we revisit that closer to\".\n\nAbsolutely not, get the fuck out of my house. \n\nShe also had a dog she was claiming lived with her mum and would just be over occasionally but I very much got the impression once the mask started to slip that she was trying to move a dog in without telling me!",

A ton of them have what I term an absence of taste, meaning they don't like anything, they only dislike things. They want everything to be boring and inoffensive so it just fades into the background. My husband is like this. When women stop caring about what men think they often start doing the things middle aged women are known for, like wearing \"loud\" clothing and jewelry, having \"eccentric\" home decor, etc. They've always enjoyed those things but were put off by men's disapproval, but by middle age they reach the point where they no longer care. Luckily, younger generations care much less about what others think of their style so this trend is fading away, and men like OP really hate it. \n\nI can say from personal experience that many of the things I love will get negative comments from my husband and my uncle (who I live with part time due to his failing health). I've got a black romper covered in skulls that I debuted recently and which was the object of much confusion from both of them. Likewise, a deep blue jumpsuit with gold cheetahs on that I get heaps of compliments on whenever I wear it. My husband came around to that one after about the fifth time someone stopped me in the street to compliment me on it. Luckily in my case both of these men adore and appreciate me, so the comments are not mean spirited and do not dampen my spirit or enjoyment of the things I love, but with men like OP that's not the case. They genuinely want to destroy their partner's enjoyment and crush their spirit until they conform. I hope his girlfriend sees this and finds someone who truly appreciates her, even if they don't understand her (frankly, amazing) taste.",

It's because he never bothered to get a real adult perspective of his own and so he just borrowed the perspective from other people. \n\nLike his colleagues or his mother. Mimicking their thoughts and opinions to seem like them. Like a child **playing** adult instead of a child who grew into an adult.\n\nI'm so sick of seeing people like OP. They get into a relationship with someone like this GF who is vibrant and alive and let's what they love fly out freely in a glorious defiance of the crap we have been force fed about how to be an adult or mature or happy. Someone who has found their own goddamn happiness instead of eating a pre-packaged version that was peddled as the answer to all problems. Someone who says f*** it to the bland hotel art and the grey walls and all the other pathetic trappings of what someone else told you is *success.*\n\nAnd then comes along this insecure, spineless little man. Of course he's attracted to her, she's happy and alive. It's magnetic, it's magical. But because he's insecure and spineless he wants her to turn it off for \"the right people\". The people he admires/fears/wants to impress. The same people his GF has already ignored the opinions of (which is why she's f****** happy and magnetic and he likes her)\n\nSo they do what they always do. They step down on them. Stop being quirky, stop being happy, stop being so *weird.*\n\nHe loved it. He still loves it. That weirdness, that spark.  much of a coward to end it with someone he doesn't like. That's why he's still here with her. But he fears the \"adults\" more than he loves her. He's a coward. He's a child. So he tells her to stop, stamping his foot in a little tantrum. Because \"what will the others think?\" Because \"my mom doesn't like it.\" \n\nGrow the fuck up and enjoy the happy woman you were first enthralled by. Or grow the fuck up and end it so you can find someone who makes everyone you are obsessed with happy instead. Be a grown man and choose between two rough choices, like a real grown up does.",
