(And the trip he took the day before)\n\nI told my mum, a few days later, that I really wanted to go to said location because I really want to get out of the house and do more things, I can't drive so I can't get to places. Buses don't reach any where particulary interesting either.\n\nSo today they both go to town and had been taking a while, so I called to find out when they were heading home so I know when to put dinner on.\nThey tell me they went out to the location ive been wanting to go to >.> \n\nI asked if they were joking and they went \"no\" and I said \"you know I've been really wanting to go\"\n\"Yea but we didn't think you were up to it, sorry\" my dad's apology was a half hearted one that was just said for the sake of it really.\nI said \"no it's fine. I'm used to it\" of which my dad continued to act as if I'm the ass hole for being disapointed.\n\nThey have done this in the past many times and each time acted like I'm the asshole when I've said that I'm upset that they go to places I've specifically asked to go only a few days prior.\n\nSo AITA for being upset that they do this?\n\nEdit to add: clarity here \ud83d\ude05 I've nothing against my parents doing things alone and I encourage them to have alone time as often as i can, even going out of my way so they can be alone.\nIt's just really hurtful when they pick locations to visit that I've asked to visit days after I've asked, if it was a few weeks it wouldn't be an issue \ud83d\ude05",

If they didn't want to take you there, how hard is it for them to tell you that instead of going through this weird passive aggressive blame shift?\n\nI'm also kind of confused by how dismissive people are being and telling you to go there by yourself: like, even if you did have a way to go there on your own, that doesn't make what they did any better?\n\nI will say though OP that i get the feeling you are clinging to your parents in a way that is harmful to yourself in the long term. This is not the first time they've done this, correct? They do not value your wants the same way you value theirs, and they do not see any issue in treating you this way. I feel like I am watching a puppy give big begging eyes for food and hoping it will not get kicked this time. in which case very soft TA for making yourself go through this knowing how it will likely end. take care of yourself: you deserve to surround yourself with people who care about how you feel.",
