  "post content": "My boyfriend (19M) and I (20F) have been dating for about three years and we've been making plans to get married and get our own place. (I currently live with his grandparents, and him with his parents.) Life happened and we've been struggling to get there and due to medical reasons I've been debating moving back in with my parents for my safety. My boyfriend was a little hesitant with it as I moved out to escape a toxic household but has come to the conclusion it's necessary for my physical health considering his grandparents aren't home when I am and they don't have the ability to help me medically if necessary.\n\nAfter coming to this agreement I went to talk to my parents as they had offered a place for me to come back to since I was having these medical issues, my mom (45F) even offered to help pay for a service dog as it was recommended by not only my doctor, but my therapist and psychiatrist. When I went over to discuss coming back, my dad (45M) pulled me aside and had a long conversation about how he felt that they should be helping my boyfriend out of his toxic situation. I completely agree that my boyfriend has a horrible living situation and I want him out of there too, but my dad said he'd be taking the room that was offered to me. I told him I was planning on moving back in, due to my medical problems, but he said he figured I'd be okay since I was \"getting help\".\n\nI was really frustrated and told my boyfriend about the situation. He was baffled and said, \"As much as I want out and as great as an offer that is, you need it more right now.\" And left it at that. He told me to tell my parents that he respectfully declines their offer, but I could tell he was at least a little bummed at not being able to leave. When I told my parents they told me they wanted to talk to him about it so I should ask him to come over. I told them that I didn't want to be a middle man for them and they should talk to them himself. They then told me they didn't want to make him feel like they were overstepping and I haven't really talked to them about it since.\n\nIt recently came up in conversation with a friend of mine and they called me and a**hole for guilting my boyfriend with my problems, and I should let him go live in a safe place where it was more affordable for him to save money. I tried to explain how I physically can't work right now because of my health problems but they said work didn't matter since my current rent was cheaper than his current rent, and he couldn't afford basic medical help due to the crazy amount of rent his parents charge. I never physically told him he couldn't move in with my parents (it's not my decision anyway), and I won't stop him if he wants to (even though I would prefer if he didn't), but he told me he doesn't want to. AITA here?\n\nEDIT: We can't move in together right now due to money, and parents won't let us live with them together unless we're married. Religion plays a part in the situation, but it isn't the big issue right now. His grandparents don't want him moving in with them due to wanting him to serve a religious mission. My grandparents are all out of state so they aren't options.",
