  "post content": " I (F33) am a proud owner of Peanut, my Yorkshire Terrier.  I took Peanut to the dog park today and Petsmart.  In the same complex is the grocery store I go to.  It was a warmer day and didn't want to leave Peanut in the car. So I leashed him up and took him in with me.  \n\nI had planned on a quick trip, no more than ten minutes. I went to the produce department to grab some stuff.  A guy, probably in his 30's, not an employee, rudely told me that pets aren't allowed in grocery stores and asked why I had my dog with me.  Before I could respond he told me it was gross as fuck to have my dog in the produce section.   I explained it was hot out and I planned to be quick in the store.  I apologized and said the most convenient thing for me was to come here with Peanut.  He told me to fuck off and not to be a lazy pet owner. Then he stormed off. It was a bit of a scene.  Feeling uncomfortable, I just left.  I thought it'd be no big deal, Peanut didn't misbehave or have an accident, And I didn't think I was being an asshole.",

The Yorkie lunged at my dog, MY MOBILITY SERVICE DOG. He tried to position himself so I could brace and the dog nipped my ankle and I fell. My dog was so distraught. After that, even after extensive rehab training, he was afraid to walk up stairs with me outside the house and he would try to body block if we encountered a small dog. He was done, washed out. I cannot afford another dog. A shitty dog owner just like you took away my ability to safely move about in public and ruined an irreplaceable medical aid that cost me over $20,000 and nearly 3 years to train.\n\nYTA.",
