We got married a few weeks ago and  my wife was a beautiful bride.\n\nMy  wife overheard from someone, that my stepfather \"Jake's\" mom (who was  not at our wedding) asked him if she was a beautiful bride, and without  skipping a beat he said no. My wife was obviously hurt and when I  confronted him he admitted he said that and told us to stop whining, he  doesn't have to lie and he isn't obligated to think everyone is  beautiful.\n\nI didn't totally know  what to do, because I do think the person who told my wife was just  stirring the shit. At the same time I'm not ok with anyone hurting or  disrespecting my wife. My wife wanted to ban him from our home, because  she didn't think she should have to have someone who felt that way (and  verbalized it) in her safe space.\n\nI  agreed and let Jake know he is banned. My mom is furious and says we  are being dramatic, and don't expect her to come without Jake. I said  while that sucks, I will back my wife. My mom isn't really talking to me  and thinks we are too sensitive",

You didn't need to confront your stepfather and blow the whole thing up, either. Whole bunch of needless and avoidable drama. ESH.",

While I think your wife is understandably upset, I personally would not take it to the point of banning family from the house. Stepfather sounds like a tool but it could also be how he was approached. I am the first to admit I have seen a bride and thought the dress was a no. I would never vocalize that, but I have thought it. You were right to side with your wife, especially when she is so upset. But she is being overly sensitive and knowing that banning your Stepfather means that your mom will not come over is way extreme.",

Just like OP's sticking up for his wife, stepfather may dislike OP and his wife because he thinks they're being rude to stepfather's wife. He doesn't like OP's wife and didn't think she looked pretty on the day. He didn't say it to her face. He mentioned it in a private conversation with someone else. That's not a crime. If stepfather said this deliberately in front of a known shit-stirrer, I'd call him an AH because he would have known that the shit-stirrer would have run to the bride with his opinion.",

He can not do better than this benchmark and you should remove all expectations.\n\nTo others points as well you absolutely need also to deal with this pot-stirring jackass too.
