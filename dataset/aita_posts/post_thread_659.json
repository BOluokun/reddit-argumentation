  "post content": "I am 28M and single. Now that covid has settled down a bit in my area, I have cautiously started dating again. I use dating apps mostly and don't really meet girls until we've talked for a week or two.  Recently I met up with a girl I've been talking with for a couple weeks and we had coffee. I thought we really hit it off so we set up a date a couple nights later for drinks. That went really well too so we set up a third date for dinner. \n\nWe decided on a fairly casual restaurant where we could sit outside and that wasn't too pricey. I arrived at the restaurant first and waited for her before getting a table. When we sit down she mentions that she forgot her wallet and asked if it was ok if I paid. We had paid for ourselves on our previous dates, but I didn't really think anything of it and agreed. It's not like the place was very expensive anyway.\n\nThe first red flag was when she immediately started being rude to the waitress. We hadn't even been sitting for 3 minutes and she made a comment about it \"taking long enough\" when the waitress came to offer us water and get a drink order. I honestly thought she was making a joke in poor taste because she hadn't behaved like this on our previous dates. She ordered a gin and tonic and when it arrived she took a sip and literally refused to believe it was a gin and tonic. I asked to take a sip and it was definitely a gin and tonic. She then accused the waitress of giving her the wrong drink to which the waitress apologized and offered to bring a new one.\n\nI honestly wouldn't be surprised if the waitress just brought back the exact same drink, but the second one was perfect according to my date. She then insisted on having an appetizer because she was starving. Ok, I like apps, lets do this. But then she ordered the most expensive entree on the menu and a little lightbulb went off in my head. She ate half her entree and then decided that it wasn't good and asked for a new one. At this point I had enough and decided I needed to do something. I excused myself to the bathroom, found our waitress, explained that this girl sucked and I was leaving but wanted to pay my half of the bill. I also told her that if she told my date that she has no idea where I went, that I would give her an extra $20 in addition to the tip. \n\nIt took about 20-minutes before my phone started blowing up. Text messages flowed in asking where I was, then when reality sunk in for her, she started asking how she was supposed to pay for her meal with no money. I blocked her after I got home and told the story to my roommate. She agrees the girl sucked but thinks I was a jerk for leaving like I did.",

Also you knew that she couldn't pay the bill, so leaving her there without any means of paying (regardless of her behaviour) was a bit shitty.",

Or do you think they gradually worked up to it?",

First story people said he was TA since he was the one who chose a fancy expensive restaurant and did not clarify upfront whether he was paying or they were splitting the bill. New version has him choosing a reasonably priced restaurant and her telling him upfront that she forgot her wallet. First version claims she was being rude and greedy because she ordered a $60 steak, however it was clarified in the comments that most of the meals were in the 50-60 price range, so what she ordered was an average meal for where he had brought her. In the new version she orders the most expensive thing on the menu. In the original version, he comments about how she kept complimenting the food and restaurant, like it was a bad thing. And people pointed that out to him too- like, so she was being appreciative and complimentary and that's a problem why? In the new version she complains about everything and is rude to the waitress. Both versions end with him ditching her and only paying for his half of the bill. He clarifies that in the comments of the original post too-- he only paid his half. In the first story he ditches while she's in the bathroom, in the second story he says he's going to the bathroom and ditches. The only extra detail I can see here is giving the waitress the extra $20. Perhaps that was added because people dogged him in the comments on the first post about how he potentially had screwed the waitress over as well in this scenario. It's so painfully obvious it's the same person/same story with details altered to make himself appear more sympathetic in the second version. As for the two accounts-- look at the user history. Both accounts have only the one post and no comments on any other posts than that story. And the posts were made a day apart.",

Read this before contacting the mod team\n\nSo I (22M) asked this girl (21F) I met on an app on a date.\n\nShe lived in the suburbs and I lived in the city, but she said she wanted to try a downtown restaurant.\n\nSo I ended up booking reservations at this steak restaurant that my company hosts a lot of dinners at.\n\nDate night comes and she starts saying how fancy the place is and how she\u2019s never experienced dining like this.\n\nI don\u2019t have an endless bank account so I asked what she was thinking of getting and she said she was still thinking because there were so many options.\n\nThen when the waitress comes my date is the one who asks if I\u2019m ready because she\u2019s ready and goes on to order an aged bone in ribeye which is $62 dollars. Meanwhile the steak I ordered was like 3/4 that cost.\n\nDuring our meal she then gets a hankering for a cosmopolitan and orders that too without really asking.\n\nAnd throughout the date the conversation was pretty mediocre and I felt like she just kept talking about the food.\n\nI subtly calculated the bill and it came out to like $200 dollars and her orders made out a much larger chunk of that.\n\nShe indicated that she wanted dessert but first needed to go \u201c freshen up.\u201d\n\nI felt really taken advantage of because she was ordering expensive stuff without any regard for me and called a waitress over for the bill.\n\nI ended up paying it and leaving because I didn\u2019t want to be used for a free meal or experience.\n\nI just started my job and my wallet isn\u2019t infinite. I felt the way she acted throughout the date was extremely entitled and I didn\u2019t want to see her again.\n\nAITA? My dad is saying that I\u2019m not being a \u201c gentleman\u201d but he\u2019s also the one who taught me never to order more than reasonably expensive things on other people\u2019s dime. I felt like my date was being greedy.\n\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.",
