  "post content": "So obviously this is a screwed up situation all around. My dad is 58 and a severe alcoholic. I am 22, I have a half sister who is 45 and a full brother who is 24. They live in different states. I did not stay behind to care for my dad but I\u2019ve really been his only support system.\n\nHe has been in and out of rehab, he\u2019s been arrested for public intoxication, public indecency, DUI well over 20 times and numerous other things that would probably break the rules to talk about them. This has been going on as long as I can remember. He is destitute, malnourished and has advanced ARD (alcohol related dementia) which is worse when he doesn\u2019t drink. He can\u2019t work, drive or care for himself in any meaningful way. I\u2019ve been there for all of it while my siblings left a long time ago and have done nothing other than an occasional check.\n\nMy sister arranged for him to be put in a long term care facility (she was not paying for it, state funded) fairly close to me. He was \u201csober\u201d but was caught several times stealing alcohol wipes to either suck on them. I visited him twice and it was like a horror show, I didn\u2019t realize places like this existed outside of the movies. During one of his coherent moments he begged me to take him out. I told him the second he had access to alcohol he\u2019ll drink again. He said he knew but he\u2019s ready to die and he\u2019s at peace with it.\n\nI talked it over with my husband and we hired a specialist to examine my dad and he said if he drinks he has maybe 6 months left. We did a quick remodel on our house so my dad will have easy access to a bathroom and we said we will buy him a 30 pack of cheap beer a day and he can stay with us until he\u2019s gone.\n\nYes it suck\u2019s but on one hand he has his family, he\u2019s not covered in bed bugs, hes clean and has entertainment. He\u2019s not stealing to fund his habit, he\u2019s not bothering the public and he won\u2019t get arrested. \n\nMy siblings think that he was going to get better in the facility and think Ive signed him up for a death sentence. I told them that they are welcome to move him to a facility closer to them so they can be the ones to visit him and see his food covered in roaches and his baths being wiped down with chemicals. My sister said she can\u2019t because of her \u201creputation as a real estate agent\u201d (my stomach hurt I laughed so hard) and my brother said he doesn\u2019t want his kids to see their grandpa like that. Both ridiculous excuses but they insist on being angry with me when I\u2019m the one who\u2019s borne all the stress and heartache of seeing this in person.\n\nTo me this allows a man who has made some terrible choices in his life the ability to at least not linger in some hell hole for the next 10 years and die as crappy as he lived\u2026but at least on his own terms \nAITA?\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t believe now this blew up. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t respond to everyone but such a sincere thank you to the first few comments and the threads with all the extremely helpful and critical information that my husband and I did not know.",

It doesn't have to be elaborate,  maybe just a walk around the block or sitting in the park watching the ducks for a while or coffee with a friend.

This is probably a good idea since it formalizes and legitimizes your care. It also prevents the appearance of elder abuse and/or neglect. Additionally, ask the doctor along with your dad about a Physician Order for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST). This is a simple one-page form that allows your dad to state what medically he wants and what he does *not* want as he declines. You should ask him to complete an Advanced Directive for Health Care (ADHC) to allow him to designate someone to make medical decisions for him when he becomes unable to do so for himself. These forms can be downloaded and (at least where I live) do not require an attorney. The POLST requires a physician signature and the ADHC probably ought to be notarized.\n\nIf he becomes a home hospice patient, the focus becomes medications and care to keep him comfortable as he dies at home. He may refuse food or fluids, but you yourself *cannot* withhold them.\n\nIf you are managing his money, accounts, social security or disability benefits or civilian or military pensions Do. Not. Commingle. Funds. (i.e. have his money in your account) It makes accountancy and budgeting difficult and it can have the appearance of embezzlement and fraud. If these funds involve the mail, mail fraud is a very serious crime with severe per offense penalties.\n\nSad to say, but if your siblings are unhappy with the plan you have described you need your dad, while he still can, to formalize his wishes and end of life care. Otherwise there is a real risk that an aggrieved family member could decide to press criminal and civil charges including elder abuse, elder neglect, manslaughter and embezzlement.",

They are adults and hopefully can make the decision to stick with you because they want to, not out of some sense of obligation. It might make them more sad to know you kicked them out in a sense to help them. \n\nBefore my grandpa passed last year, he had told me all my life that if he ever ended up like he did, he did not want me around to see him like that. He helped raise me as basically my dad, we were best friends. He ended up having a stroke and developed some form of vascular dementia, even developed aphasia basically while walking out of the grocery store. I stayed with him even when we had to make the terrible decision to not let him die at home and put him in an assisted living community as my family just couldn't give him the level of care he needed anymore and it was draining my grandma fast as well. \n\nI still visited him every week twice a week and one time he became lucid for a few minutes and asked me to go get his gun and let him go out to the field like he had always said he would do if he got to ve like that, but obviously I couldn't and he asked me to just not visit again as he didn't want me to see him like that. \n\nI just couldn't do it and eventually was in the room with him when he died. Even though I'm still a shithole wreck that others may not see, I'm still glad I stuck with him and didn't let him be alone even though he tried to push me away. \n\nI hope you might be able to give your cherished ones the chance to be with you and help uplift you as well.

Myself and pretty much every nurse I know that works in eldercare have plans on how to take ourselves out on our own terms when our health fails and we're faced with being trapped in places like that. \n\nBut, 30/day could realistically be his maintenance amount if he's drank as heavily and as long as op describes. Might as well give him the amount that keeps him from causing more harm trying to get more. I also really hope she looks into home health services. If he qualified for state funded live in care then he very likely qualifies for visits a few times a week as long as he isn't violent. I hope she gets help from as many services as she can.",

After years of being constantly hurt and disappointed, I had to pull away from them for my own mental well-being. \n\nPlease don\u2019t be so harsh in your judgment of OP\u2019s siblings. All three of them have obviously chosen to deal with their father\u2019s alcoholism and impending death in different ways. None of them are wrong for that. Dad has caused immense suffering for all of his family members that will probably be felt for generations to come. Why should any of them have to watch him kill himself, especially when he has already inflicted God only knows how much pain and trauma in each of his children\u2019s lives?  \n\nI\u2019m sorry OP has to be in the position to even make this decision. Siblings aren\u2019t around to fully appreciate how bad off their dad is, and may think there is still hope for recovery. That was MY knee jerk reaction when first reading this post. However, that was an emotional reaction not a logical, educated one. Maybe OP should do a virtual meeting with dad present so they can see for themselves how ill he is. Include his doctor and a SW or psychologist to help facilitate the conversation so that all his children are on the same page as far as what can be done to give dad a peaceful transition. Personally, I think the only AH here is alcoholism/addiction. OP, I applaud your loving, compassionate spirit and hope that you and your siblings can allow this experience to draw you closer to each other.

The excuse of not wanting the kids around that comes from many different places. I know with my grandmother it was because my dad had been told by her before she got sick that she hated my dad's kids because we weren't full Italian or full French. It was also around the same time that we also learned that when my dad was very young she had abandoned him, never came home, a few weeks later when his aunt hadn't seen him nor heard from them she came over to find him alone in the apartment. We would always ask why we can't go see her or why even when she got sick we couldn't see her, it was because my dad didn't want us to build a relationship with her and then be \"abandoned\" like he had. he was protecting us from something he had endured. \n\nIn this case with the brother, it sounds like it's the same thing; he doesn't want his children to feel what he felt growing up, even for a short period of time. Now, is it right, not necessarily, but parents will do anything to protect their kids from any form of harm, even if as an outsider looking in it seems so bullshit and cruel. The brother is probably not wanting the kids to make memories of their grandfather and have them be sad or upsetting memories. most people have good memories of their grandparents and of course those same people have the sad ones near the end, but they have the good ones to remember them by. The brother might not want them to have only bad or negative memories of their grandfather and only have those to remember him by. Maybe the brother doesn't want the kids to have a tainted view of him and simply know that they had a grandfather that loved them and was very ill and is now gone. In honest that's far better than having them go and see him while he's in the state he's in. \n\nEven if he leaves the kids at home and goes afterwards, the kids are going to get curious and start asking questions, and if not, they are going to figure it out on their own and then the kids have a choice to make: do they confront their father about it or do they hold resentment and anger over it? This is not something kids should have to deal with at a young age. Then what about the grandfather in this case? We have to ask ourselves if the brother knows that his father would never want his grandkids to see him like this, knowing full well that he has made terrible mistakes in his life with his own kids. The brother absolutely knows more about his father than we do and we can only assume things. Maybe the father had expressed previously not to bring the kids around to see him the way he is, or maybe he feels like he would just be a disappointment to them, much like he feels that his own children might view him as. \n\nIt's easy for you or anyone to label the situation as bullshit and move on because we don't know the intricacies of it, but what I do know is that it's not a simple open and shut response when it comes to dealing with this type of situation. We have to take into account the brother and what he's thinking, the kids and what they are thinking, and the father and what he's thinking. I have seen it time and again where I work and each family has made different choices in the exact same situation, because no one is the same and they know the others involved far better than I ever will.",

Buying your father alcohol to drink himself to death, especially after a doctor explicitly told you that he will die if he consumes alcohol, may well result in you being criminally charged and prosecuted for your dad's death.\n\nTaking in your dad likely means you have taken on a duty of care towards him. Buying him alcohol could be a violation of that duty. When that alcohol leads to his death, the legal conclusion may be that YOU killed him. So seriously, go see a criminal lawyer in your jurisdiction before you continue with this plan.",
