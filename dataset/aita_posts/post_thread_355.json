  "post content": "So me (26M) and my Girlfriend (22F) have been dating for around 2 years now. We've had our ups and downs but overall we have a great relationship, and I definitely see a future together! We really love and respect each other and connect well! But the thing is we come from different backgrounds. I come from a Muslim Background (I'm not 'that' religious tho) and she is White. However, we have still made it work and our similarities are much more than our differences.\r  \n\r  \nNow my gf does like wearing a bit short clothing when out and about, which used to bother me at first and made me uncomfortable and we did have a few minor fights over it, but eventually I came to terms with it.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, recently an embarrassing situation happened. There was a pool party at my cousin's house, and my parents were there too. I had recently introduced my gf to my parents as well, so this was a good time for to meet family and relatives. I specifically told her to please pack something more on the modest side, as my family would be there (and most women usually don't wear such revealing stuff in our culture). She didn't give much of a response and just nodded.\r  \n\r  \nBut what did I see in the pool? Her wearing a two piece bikini (with kinda cheeky bottoms too)! Even one piece would've been more better, but nah she went all in this time! She was probably the one the dressed most immodestly.\r  \n\r  \nNo one said anything but afterwards, I was so embarrassed I couldn't show my face to my parents and all.\r  \n\r  \nI did talk to her about it and scolded her a bit, and she told me \"She can wear whatever the hell she wants, whenever she wants.\"\r  \n\r  \nI couldn't say anything afterwards. We've been quiet to each other for a while but slowly making up now.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?",

Its a typical case of having your cake and eating it too. You discuss these things beforehand especially if you have a cultural difference. If your morals don't align you break up. This is not going to get any better when the relationship continuous. How are you going to raise the kids? It's not disrespecting them in their own home, it's values not aligning. \n\nAlso don't have a pool party if you don't wanna see skin.\n\nEdit: Both individuals are adults. You cannot change someone, you cannot force a concessions. This only happens because the other side is willing to do so. This is just as true for OP as for his GF. Every single comment in the thread, is true for both sides. Why isn't he respecting her or why isn't she respecting him. People think my immediate response is to break them up, which is not my intent. But it is time to have a good chat and to take a good look in the mirror about whether your values in life align. About how much of a concession both of you are willing to make - and yes this means both OP and his GF. Cause if both don't wanna make any then yeah ill say it, it's doomed to fail. What is normal for OP might not be normal for GF and the other way around, so communicate.",

Sure, she has freedom to technically wear what she wants, but that freedom is also to say, you know what, I don't want to have to feel bad about this when I'm around you or my potential in-laws, so maybe we shouldn't date anymore. \n\nNAH - sometimes cultural gaps can be hard to overcome and everyone has the right to feel what they feel and act accordingly. I honestly think OP and GF would be happier with other people long term. \n\nRandom note: some people here haven't been to pool parties where the code of modesty is so strict that people are basically dressed head to toe in the water.

If discussions are had, ground rules are set, and both parties uphold their shared value system (even in the face of unhappiness from others in the family / culture), everything can be fantastic.\n\nI saw a comment on a post the other day about someone's partner being grossed out by one of the cultural dishes they ate (baby birds IIRC). The commenter said that's why people should date within their own cultures. I called bullshit: I can eat all the meat I want, but I'm not going to serve steaks to my Hindu inlaws. I mostly quit eating beef in response to my inlaws (for many Indians, eating a cow would be the same as eating a dog for those of us in the west). If hamburgers were more important to me than keeping a good relationship with the family of my true partner in life... Then he could do better than me.\n\nOP's situation sounds like if my Hindu inlaws invited me for a potluck, and I brought rib eye steaks to grill. Am I wrong to eat steak? No. Is that immature, disrespectful, and invalidating beyond words? Absolutely.\n\nNTA. Find a partner who's willing to stand their ground on issues that matter to them, and follow your lead on issues that matter to you.",

We all have bodies, we all know what they look like. Bodies do not HAVE to be sexualized. Religion says you must cover up to not incite lust. But flesh is flesh. The flesh of my breast is no different than my arm. The only difference is how those on the outside choose to perceive them.

And feels very self conscious about that. I knew a heap of guts like him at uni - they all fucked around but ended up marrying \"good girls\" from their culture that hltheur mums chose or approved of. The friends I know who married outside their culture (myself included) all understand that you take someone ABD their culture and you ask your parents to accept that they do things differently.  \n\nAnd a realistically, relationships will ONLY work if you are prepared to respect your partner and put them before your parents' expectations.",
