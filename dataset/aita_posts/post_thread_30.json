  "post content": "Heyo,\nI'm a schizophrenic.  Started when I was 22, and will last till I die. I'm active in schizophrenic communities, go to groups,  the works but I am fairly private about it to most people to include friends. It's fairly common for people to think I'm eccentric (comes with the turf) due to some of my habits. Those habits include not going to parties or other places with lots of people, suddenly deciding not to do something (I have to be protective not to do or go to certain things if I think a delusion might be coming on), saying the occasional odd quip, normal schizophrenic stuff.\n\nSome friends thought it would be funny to make it seem like  I might be going crazy as a group. They would individually wear something silly like a wizard hat or dinosaur costume (TRex blow up costume) to a group event or say something totally out of the ordinary and pretend like it was normal (Police like to track people like you, covid is just a way to microchip you, etc). These are very real scary thoughts to me. I would ask members of the group if they had heard concerns about these conspiracies or weird garb from the other members, but they all acted like they had hung out with that particular member that day and I hadn't been involved.\n\nI was really, really scared that this could have been a massive delusion morphing into a full psychosis so I preemptively checked myself into a hospital to stop myself from potentially hurting myself or diving further into the rabbit hole(common in schizophrenic community). I was so scared my medications stopped working. No one heard from me for a few days while I was in the hospital, and when I checked out I confided in one of them about what had happened. I got a really long apology explaining what had happened and I blew up at them. \n\nI have ignored attempts from the others trying to apologize and have no desire to talk with them again.\n\nAITA for not previously stating that I am schizophrenic?\n\nEdit- People have been asking saying to post the length of the prank. Around 3 weeks.\n\nEdit 2- Thank you for the awards and stuff, but I really want to highlight some of the messages I have gotten. I'm at around 150 messages and counting and am trying to respond to the ones where I can hopefully offer insight.\n\nResources that I find helpful- r/schizophrenia \n\nFor groups just google schizophrenia support groups in my area, something will pop up and when you actually get there someone will have a further list. \n\nYou get what you put into groups. You don't have to talk your first couple of times. But no one will look at you with the batshit look if you say \"Reality check- is there a bird in the room or something in that regard\". That did happen once and the audible sigh of relief from 8 other people and the laughter that followed was hysterical. \n\nMedication helps so much. It's the difference between being able to go for a walk with my dog and staying in bed all day. But it takes time. So many people have asked what drug and dosage a loved on should go on. I cannot answer that. There are so many drugs out there and different dosages. I can tell you that you (probably) will not have a noticable difference in behavior in two weeks after trying a medication. You start small, and work your way up to a therapeutic effect (when it actually helps). It might take some time to actually get to feeling human again. Not every medication is meant for every person, but don't give up!",

Then I was thinking \"well it went on a long time,\" but there are people here talking about funny pranks that went for 6 months. \n\nI guess there is something about them sort of not admitting that weird shit was happening that goes a little off... Like if you spork someone's lawn, you agree that their lawn got sporked, you just don't admit to doing it. So the person doesn't know why or how, but doesn't question their sense of reality. \n\nAnd maybe that's the fine line? I mean, you have to know your target, too, and *not* prey on their known vulnerabilities (not saying OP's friends knew, OP says they didn't), so like if you know someone is terrified of sporks, you can't spork their lawn. But minor vulnerabilities, like someone can't do without their first cup of coffee so you hide the coffee, are ok, but you need to put the coffee somewhere findable, and only if you know the person won't go crazy looking for it...\n\nPranking is *such* a fine line. And a lot rests on how the prank comes out, so to some extent it's one of those things that's undertaken in a vacuum, then judged in hindsight with 20/20 vision. \n\nI'm at NAH. I honestly don't think the friends are assholes here, because they legit didn't think they were doing anything mean spirited or that wrong, certainly nothing that would drive anyone to check into a hospital. And you or me wouldn't have, they just accidentally happened onto a friend's previously-undisclosed weak point. But OP isn't wrong to be pissed as hell, either, because this prank didn't work and had serious life consequences for OP. \n\nThis is why I just don't prank people.",

They were confused as they clearly recognized the location, and snuck out to investigate\n\nPersonally, I think all surprise parties are technically pranks. But not all pranks are surprise parties. ;)",

We were friends because we did some of the same extracurricular activities, and at parties we\u2019d flirt sometimes, but he definitely was not interested in me and kind of kept his distance. I was desperately in need of the antidepressants I now take, and was just a whirlwind of bad decisions at the time, but this is one of my worst decisions of all time and I live with the regret to this day.\n\nThe other people in his \u201cpopular\u201d friend group were all *very* mean. They would say it was their sense of humor, that everyone was in on it so it wasn\u2019t a big deal, but they could be really cutting. One running joke was that this guy I had a crush on was fat. It couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, he was super athletic and ran marathons and shit, but he also partied pretty hard so he was like muscular and slim with just the tiniest bit of a soft belly, which I thought was soooo sexy. So it never even crossed my mind that he would *believe* what people were saying, and I joined in. The group loved me for it, and the guy would always laugh. I started doing it all the time, because it was the only time I felt accepted into the group, and I thought it was bringing me closer to this guy.\n\nWell, it turned out this guy had an eating disorder, and his \u201cfriends\u201d called him fat all the time on purpose. I don\u2019t know if they thought they could make him realize how *not* fat he was, like how silly it was to be hung up on that because it was so clearly not true, or if they just truly were evil and wanted to hurt him. I sure as hell felt evil when I found out, and to this day I can\u2019t believe I thought it was a good idea to *ridicule someone for months on end about their weight.* What the fuck??\n\nI made some serious, serious errors in judgment.

I\u2019m so sorry that you experienced the terrible actions of the people who bullied you, and I\u2019m so *endlessly* sorry that I have participated in that kind of bullying. It\u2019s not okay.",

A little back story, this was the first time I had ever had a bigger friend group. Up until this group I typically had one best friend or was kinda a loner... Also, I was the newest person to this friend group so most of the time I went along with what everyone else wanted thinking it was normal. Ugh. Whyyy.\n\nOne of the girls in our group broke up with her boyfriend (of a month) and proceeded to be very clingy, and negative. I'll call her Mary. Mary would invite us over to hang out and watch The Notebook on repeat and cry. She was constantly talking about her ex boyfriend and how much she missed him and how she thought they were going to end up together and eventually get married.  \n\nIt went on for about a month and a half when we all started getting annoyed by her behavior. One of the more outspoken(looking back she was just insecure and controlling) friends (I'll call her Jackie) talked to everyone(excluding Mary of course) and said that Mary has gone too far and we needed to confront her about it and ultimately kick her out of our friend group.  I remember looking around for anyone to disagree and when no one did I figured it must be just how groups of friends work so it was ok.  About a week later, Jackie told Mary to meet us at our usual spot by the lockers. Jackie then had everyone take turns telling Mary how annoying she has been and then ended it with \"So now you can't hang out with us anymore unless you can promise to be less depressing and whiny.\" \n\nLooking back it was so unbelievably cruel. In reality, Mary's parents were going through a really rough time (almost getting divorced), her older sibling was acting out because of it and her boyfriend dumped her after a month of dating but 4 years of being best friends/neighbors. I think about it often and still feel awful I didn't step up for Mary. \n\n  Out of curiosity, have you reached out to the guy and apologized?",

They probably started small, then once you didn\u2019t call them out on something they got more and more confused as to why you weren\u2019t pointing out the wizard hat or disagreed with the conspiracy theories. They probably thought you were gullible or oblivious and wanted to see how much you would ignore. Even if they knew you weren\u2019t that oblivious, you were acting like it and the rules of the prank are that you keep doing more and more extreme stuff until the person being pranked notices.   \nAgain, although the extent they went to seems like it became more and more extreme, this is a common prank. I have done this. Others have done this to me. In my experience, it is generally funny- Funny for people to do, then funny for you all to laugh about after.  \nThey clearly did not know you had schizophrenia and this genuinely just concerned you. That is awful and unfair and I am sorry you suffer from this. But how were your friends supposed to know? They were not trying to get you to check into a medical facility and genuinely think you were crazy\u2014 They clearly saw you as one of the guy and schizophrenia is uncommon enough I do not ask my friends if they are schizophrenic. If their apologies seem genuine, I would wait some time but probably forgive them. It is justified you feel upset, but this was one of the oldest pranks in the book. They did it in the office with seeing what Stanley wouldn\u2019t notice, and other versions of it have happened in other shows and comedy skits as well.   \nThis post in particular seems to have fallen victim to a sort of reddit echo chamber or inexperienced respondents. This prank is not an unforgivable offense to cut off all your friends for. It is a tragic misunderstanding and mistake on their part. If their apologies are genuine and you can find it within yourself to forgive, I would encourage it. But there are no TA people here.",

Even without schizophrenia in play, this was taken too far for too long. How is causing someone distress in any way for three weeks funny?  Maybe for you, but not for the OP.
