  "post content": "***Repost to comply with rules:***\n\nHi everyone,\n\nWhen I (33m) was younger, I was not the most popular kid in class. I did the musicals, and academic subjects. I wasn't much of a sportsperson, and not really very social. Toward the end of HS, I made quite a few friends and it got easier. But one of the \"popular kids\" - lets call him Jake - constantly taunted me - for my ethnicity, my body, my \"nerdiness\" and what have you. I have never forgotten it and constantly resented him for it.\n\nFast forward 15 years. Jake has done something very stupid and immature, and as a result, he has been in a coma for several years. I left my country when I graduated Uni, and now live in a major city abroad earning a pretty significant sum. I'm known in my field, and everyone I went to school with is aware of this. Quite frankly, the fat musical kid ended up the most successful graduate of his class.\n\nFor many years, the parents and friends of Jake paid his medical bills to keep him on a ventilator. I never really sympathised to be honest, and kind of thought he had it coming. Anyway, an old friend messages me the other day telling me that the gofundme is finished, and that the parents are almost bankrupt, and \"everyone\" would appreciate it if maybe i could kick 20-30k toward his medical bills. I laughed and said \"absolutely not, I work for my money and the last thing I want to do with it is give it to the person who made my last year at school a misery.\"\n\nNow I am being told I'm a selfish a\\*\\*hole for not helping because \"clearly I can afford it.\" This is despite the person asking knowing that I was mercilessly bullied by Jake. I kinda see it as Karma. I've made it in life and don't want to share the spoils with people who tried to belittle me.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: For all of you wonderful people suggesting therapy I appreciate you. But I\u2019m not that kid anymore, I\u2019m a successful professional, married to an amazing woman, with a beautiful daughter. I haven\u2019t thought about \u201cJake\u201d for many years - not since I saw the articles in the newspaper about his calamity. I am certain I needed therapy back then - but I\u2019ve matured and come into my own since that time. I\u2019m happy, healthy and satisfied. I love my life, I love my family, but most importantly, I love myself too. I don\u2019t dwell on the past, but when somebody calls you for 20-30 grand, memories can come back to you very quickly.**  \n\n\nSecond edit: WOW! Thank you to all the amazing people who have helped me feel a little less shitty this evening. I am trying to reply to everyone and I'm sorry I have not published exactly why \"Jake\" is in a coma but I am trying to reply to DMs that ask. This community is amazing, I felt really shitty today and all of you have done so much to make me feel better about it all. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. xxx",
