While the act of doing this is not hard and I love her fur babies, I\u2019m still giving up my time. I\u2019m not saying that I need monetary compensation necessarily but when I got there there was no food, anything to drink, nor did she leave me any money. To me, it makes me feel like she doesn\u2019t think that my time is valuable. I really want to say something because I don\u2019t want to have resentment about it but I don\u2019t know how to word it without sounding like an a hole if I do. I know she usually has family do it and prob doesn\u2019t comp them but I am currently out of a job and she knows this, so even stocking the fridge with some food would\u2019ve been nice so I didn\u2019t have to spend money on that while I came out here. Help!!! Ty in advance :)",

OP should just not agree to puppysit again if they don't want to do it without being compensated in some way. Alternatively, they could say \"I'd love to but I'm useless at organising food to bring with me and last time I spent a heap on takeaway food. My budget was very sad for weeks lol \". This gives the friend the opportunity to offer to put a few pizzas in the freezer and make sure there is bread, milk and cereal in the house. Or ask the friend to bring the dog to her place.",

A LOT of friends do favors for each other for free.  She may just assume you are that kind of friend and she'll get you back with a favor in the future.  It's definitely not out of line to ask to get paid, but you need to ask.",
