My sister-in-law\u2019s daughter came downstairs just as my son was finishing up and started crying because there were no more pancakes for her. \n\nI did try to comfort her but I have really bad morning sickness after I eat and I was starting to feel sick so I had to take her to her parents who were still sleeping.\n\nLong story short my sister-in-law was upset I only made pancakes for myself and my son when there were others in the house who also needed to eat breakfast. She said I was selfish and I should\u2019ve known my niece would\u2019ve wanted some too so I could\u2019ve made extra just in case.\n \nAITA?",

Wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal to have made extra but if everyone was asleep, I\u2019d have probably done the same depending on the hour and not knowing when everyone else would wake. I would however offer to make extra the next time now knowing that niece would have liked them, even if they aren\u2019t fresh off the griddle and is allowed to have them. Sounds more like this was just an impromptu thing, not done intentionally to slight anyone. \n\nWe personally try and limit sweet breakfasts in our home, so I would not have been thrilled about my kids being fed pancakes without my okay, though I also wouldn\u2019t complain over a nice gesture, esp since it would be my fault for not being up to see to my kid\u2019s meal.",

Whether you made just enough batter for your specific needs or made extra batter and placed it in the fridge because no one else was awake (on vacation I'd want my pancakes fresh and piping hot and not want rubbery reheated leftovers no matter how good they are with nutella) you are still NTA even without the addition of your morning sickness and I don't understand all those saying you are. \n\nI expected you'd be saying you and your son had this amazing pile and  ate them in front of her while refusing to make more even though you could have easily done so which is not the case at all and is actually beside the point.
