  "post content": "My mom always gets the best gifts. It has been a big point of contention in my marriage for years as my wife feels that my mom should be getting gifts for her kids partners as we are older and in relationships. It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize she was right because that was just so foreign to me and i felt super uncomfortable when my in laws gave me gifts.\n\nLast year I hinted at something my wife really wanted and hoped my mom would get it, but this year I decided to set a firm boundary and not accept any gifts from my mom unless she also has gifts for my family (wife and 1.5 year old son) Now I take full accountability here. I fucked up and didn't have the conversation with my mom. I really did mean to, but life just got in the way and it didn't cross my mind until we arrived. She had my dream gift. I've been wanting a snowmobile for a couple years now and she got me one. I knew it was going to suck but there was nothing for my wife or son, so I pulled her aside and said I couldn't accept it.\n\nShe seemed really confused and said she shouldn't have to buy gifts for my wife and called it weird. She said my son is only 1.5 and won't even notice. I told her I was sorry and it was an amazing gift but she was going to have to return it. She was frigid the rest of the night and wouldn't even say goodbye. Her brother's wife pulled me aside and told me I was completely inappropriate and she would never expect my grandma to buy her anything. My uncle married her. No one else in the family did. My uncle and grandma also begged me to go and apologize to my mom and it was hard, but I couldn't. Now apparently the whole family is talking shit about what an asshole I am.",
