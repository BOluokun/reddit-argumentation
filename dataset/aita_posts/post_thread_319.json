I recently got back to work and since I work nightshifts, I had to get the kids a babysitter (they're at school during the day and my sister stays with them) I was able to find a babysitter with the help of a co worker (actually they're related) and things have been going pretty well except for few days ago.\n\n\nThe babysitter called me while I was at work to tell me that my 9 year old daughter broke her glasses, I got home, heard both sides of the story and came to a conclusion that it was in fact an accident. but the babysitter said my daughter broke them intentionally after she refused to let her outside late in the evening. I asked my 11 year old daughter and she said the babysitter's story is accurate but since she and her sister have a beef then, I figured she lied to set her sister up. my 9 year old daughter cried and said she didn't mean it and it was an accident. I apologized to the babysitter for the misunderstanding but she insisted there was no misunderstanding and then asked me to pay her for a pair of new glasses. I was taken aback by her request and told her I thought we talked this out and rolled it out as an accident but she insisted it wasn't an accident. I apologized but refused and said it was unfair to expect me to pay, especially since she didn't pay attention to keep her glasses safe regardless of wether it was an accident or not. The babysitter argued with me then started crying swearing that my daughter broke them to get back at her. My 11 year old daughter sided with her but my 9 year old said she is only siding with the babysitter for her own benefits. The girls started fighting and I ended up telling the babysitter to leave. she got my co worker involved and she said I should take responsibility and pay the babysitter for new glasses since she can not afford them being a broke college student and in need for glasses. I apologized but refused to pay, my co worker got upset and shamed me for condoning my younger daughter's actions and treating the babysitter poorly when she's the victim in this situation.\n\n\nIt's been days and the babysitter is still wanting me to pay for new glasses but I feel like she's trying to use the fact that I'm in dire need of help and is hoping to get extra money out of my pocket.",

Just because she didn't 'mean' it doesn't mean it has no consequences.\n\nOP, YTA and massively.\n\n>I asked my 11 year old daughter and she said the babysitter's story is accurate but since she and her sister have a beef then, I figured she lied to set her sister up.\n\nThis reeks of favoritism. Two out of three people told the same story, and you choose to believe the other one? Your children should be equally credible in other situations, and the 11 year old is even more credible here because the babysitter backed up her story.\n\nThere's no basis for you to make that conclusion besides the fact that you obviously consider your youngest the golden child.\n\n>I apologized but refused and said it was unfair to expect me to pay, especially since she didn't pay attention to keep her glasses safe regardless of whether it was an accident or not.\n\nSo it's her fault *your child* broke it? Regardless of whether it was an accident or not, she shouldn't have to foresee the kid's tantrums.\n\n>I feel like she's trying to use the fact that I'm in dire need of help and is hoping to get extra money out of my pocket.\n\nOr maybe she's just a broke college student whose glasses - a medical accessory needed for *seeing* \\- your daughter damaged?\n\nOP, you're being a horrible father to both your children.\n\n1. You obviously favor your youngest over her sister, which I assume is a pattern and not just because it saves you money. Why are you so quick to assume that she's lying when her sister has a much more obvious, and valid, motive to lie?\n2. You're teaching the 9 year old some dangerous lessons. What your actions indicate is that, not only does damaging others' property (even accidentally, which I doubt) have no consequences, lying will also be tolerated as long as it serves you. Not good lessons to teach a 9 yo, are they?",

All of the comments are right on the money I hope you read them but there are some important things missing most importantly you're about to f up both your daughters for life if you don't cut this out\n\n\n2. As the other redditor said, if we're in a car accident and I say I'm sorry, would you just let me walk away and you'll pay the bill for fixing your own car? Whether it's an accident or deliberate, the person who did it is responsible for making the victim whole. As your daughter is a 9-year-old it is your responsibility as the parent to make the victim whole.  I am saying victim because this poor young lady is out a pair of medically necessary glasses, she needs to see properly to function!\n\n\n3. Way to go Dad of the year by marginalizing your 11-year-old because you suspect she's piling on because she's fighting with her sister. You don't think it's possible for somebody to tell the truth about a situation just because they are currently not getting along with one of the parties? Way to tell your daughter you don't respect her, way to tell your daughter you don't trust her. Good luck with that when she hits her teens, you better start praying now she never really needs you because she's not going to come to you with the truth on anything. You need to go back to your 11-year-old,  have a conversation with her, you need to say you respect her feedback and her observations and that you trust her. Because right now you have to told her publicly that you do not trust her over her 9-year-old sister.\n\n\n4. Way to go Dad teaching your 9-year-old and 11-year-old that there are no consequences if you didn't mean it and it was an accident. Guess what? Accidents happen, you took a great teachable moment and instead of raising up your daughters and teach them to be good adults, you chose to be punitive against the babysitter. This was a chance to teach your daughters that the truth is the most important thing, that it's okay in life if accidents happen, but when accidents happen the way you recover from them is by doing the right thing. People should be made whole if there's an accident, and you could have parlayed that right into setting expectations for as they get older and will begin to borrow things from each other. Daughters are notorious for borrowing each other's clothes, makeup, music and electronics... This was a chance to lay the foundation that while you might borrow things from others it's still your responsibility to return them in the same condition in which it was borrowed.\n\n\n5. Why are you digging your heels in so much over a pair of glasses? Not only are you being unfair, but this story will travel and it might impede your ability to find babysitters to fill in when you need help.\n\n\nI suggest you think about this entry and the responses of all the other redditors, on this situation you missed the ball completely.\n\nEdit.. grammar",

Definitely the AH.\n\nCommenting to also add that you are in what seems like a tough situation OP, and I'm sure everyone sympathizes, but it's not an excuse. You need someone at night that you can trust, and were fortunately helped by a colleague to watch your girls at night. Finding someone like that who is affordable and trustworthy  is not going to be easy, so accident or not, you should at least pay 50% of a new pair (but ideally 100% because as it's been mentioned, accident or not, your daughter was involved).\n\nIf you want to salvage the relationship with the babysitter, I would recommend calling them and apologizing sooner rather than later. Maybe explain you were taken aback by the situation, it was late, and you've had the opportunity to think about it and you're willing to help pay for the glasses (you can negotiate I suppose).\n\nThis is still a teachable moment as well. You can even talk to your daughters and get more from the story. Explain your not angry, but that accidents do happen and it's a person's responsibility to own up to their mistakes (accidental or not) and deal woth the consequences. \n\nI hope you decide to pay for the glasses, at least in part, and use this as a means to teach your daughters.\n\nMy sympathies for your loss and best of luck\n\nEdit: spelling/grammar",

I am pretty dependant on my glasses but I'm still nowhere near super expensive lens level.\n\nIn college I suffered a lot because I didn't have $100 to spare (not just for glasses but in general) and it would likely mean missed meals even if I went with much cheaper glasses (I think the lowest price I ever saw was $49 but things may have changed).
