  "post content": "I (M26) am a second generation French immigrant to the US. I speak French and most of my family lives in France, so I try to make a trip back to France once or twice a year.\n\nI have been dating an American girl (F24) for two years now. My girlfriend does not speak French at all. The actual events in question happened this winter.\n\nI usually go to France around Christmas time. The most recent Christmas, my girlfriend wanted to come with me. I said sure as she had never been to France before and we'd been dating almost two years so it seemed reasonable. \n\nMy family comes from the South West, but I also have family in Paris so we stopped in Paris first. My gf wanted to eat at a fancy French restaurant while we were there, something with Michelin stars. Expensive, but not really a problem since I make pretty good money.\n\nWe made a reservation for a good restaurant, not the best but still good. We had to make it months in advance because it's a restaurant that's high in demand. As a very upscale restaurant, there was also a dress code and things like that.\n\nWe showed up and everything was fine at first. They took our coats, we sat down, the restaurant was beautiful, etc. The waiter then gave us our menu. I had to do all the communication as my gf doesn't speak French.\n\nI was showing my gf something on my menu and she noticed that mine had prices and hers didn't. I had completely forgotten about this tradition because it's just not common at all in the US.\n\nShe asked me why mine had prices but not hers. I explained to her that it was just a tradition in many upscale French restaurants. She called it sexist and said it was ridiculous. I told her that it's just the way it is in these kinds of places, and that we shouldn't have come here if she was upset by this.\n\nShe wanted me to ask for a menu with prices for her. I refused because we already had the prices and I didn't want to make a scene. She demanded that I confront a waiter about it or she would walk out. I called her bluff and she ended up staying, but didn't talk to me for the whole meal, which was delicious by the way.\n\nWe've been back home for several months but she keeps bringing it up. I'm honestly considering ending the relationship over this because she will not stop talking about. She keeps accusing me of being sexist (I'm not) and has been making ridiculous comparisons.\n\nAITA?",

He's a waiter responsible for customer service. It may be tradition, but I highly doubt it's restaurant policy to refuse to share their prices with their female clientele.",

Also; I\u2019d like to say that while my experience in the industry is that this was a host menu, I am completely accepting that experiences may vary. Sexism is painfully real and is harmful to not just women but society as a whole. We all have our part to play in challenging harmful societal norms and if a menu is your chosen vector for that, then I support you entirely.",

Had you made a reservation for a group, you would have been the only one with the prices too; irrelevant of gender of the other people present.\n\nHere's the thing... I've been to Paris. I ate in at least 2 upscale restaurants while there (edit: that implemented this policy). I made ALL of the reservations because I am the planner in the relationship. And my husband was given the menu with the prices at both locations. \n\nI mean, It's fully possible that both restaurants made errors and that it's just a crazy coincidence, but since it happened at both places, I'm less inclined to believe that's true. The only source I have been able to find that this \"tradition\" is \"give the price menu to the person who made the reservation\" is in this thread. \n\nSo, I guess what I'm asking is, are you sure?",

In **practice** the restaurant staff doesn't look at the name on the reservation (or maybe they only have a last name on the reservation book, and the couple share the same last name) and just gives it to the man because of their personal \\[sexist\\] assumptions.  \n\nI'm curious since I've never heard of this tradition and you have some experience with it, were both reservations under your first and last name?  And if so, is your first name traditionally known to be a female name?  Meaning if the restaurant staff looked at the reservation name would they absolutely know you were the one who made it?",
