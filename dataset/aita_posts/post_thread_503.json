  "post content": "\n\nHello again reddit. Last time I was here I complained about my mother's and my relationship. This time I'm here to talk about my father. This happened just last week and I can't seem to get out of my mind. \n\nMy(15f) parents (38m and 38f) relationship has been a bit rough these past couple of days. They still very much love each other and there are no signs of divorce or anything jurassic but they have been arguing alot.  And last time they argued my dad took it too far. I was upstairs playing games on my pc while my sister (11f) was in hers.\n\n My parents went out to get supplies for a event we had the next day. I wasn't sure what happpend but my mom returned home by herself. She was pulling out supplies when she turned to me and said \"Papi is walking home. He jumped out of the car at the drive thru and told me he was walking home after a arguement\" \n\nI was shocked and she told me she had to leave again. There was one more place she needed to stop by. So she left again. She brought us food but I ate it so fast out of stress eating. Something about my dad is that he is narcissistic. He thinks he's indestructible but I know he isn't and yes our neighborhood is very good but my anxiety went throught the roof. \n\nI opened our garage and waited for him. After 10 mins I broke down Panicking. I wanted to leave to go look for him, I knew the general area of where he could be, but my sister was home and I knew I couldn't leave. I broke down crying pacing the garage and after another 20 mins he got home. I ran into his arms and hugged him. Then told him how stupid he was. Hers how the convo went. \n\n\"NEVER do that again you had me worried\" keep in mind I'm still bawling my eyes out\n\n\"Worried? About what it's me we are talking about cmom\" he said with a chuckle\n\n\"YOU NEVER FUCKING KNOW PAPI\" at this point I'm shouting\n\n\"(my name) you are crying for nothing\" He said at this point laughing. \n\nI told him I can't stand to look at him and ran upstairs. \n\nI can't forgive him. I've never felt fear like that before in my life. The next two days I gave him a bit of a cold shoulder and my moms telling me it's not my battle and I should forgive him and I'm being a jerk for holing a grudge that isn't mines. \n\nAm I?",

Based of information from my mom she told he he got out the car and that's it. he ignore her calls and her texts. When she told me it just put me into high panic mode. If he like just told her he needed to blow off steam then she told me then that's fine I wouldn't have been worried. But I know him well enough to know what he did was being petty. And I completely understand what your saying but I am in no way a narcissistic person. It's him and I dont want to like put all of our drama out but just know it's never been me its him. Also I'm not sure if this was kinda clear but I texted him and asked him where he was and if he was alright but he ignored all of my texts and left me on read which probably sent me into a large panic mode. Which may have been where I was over the top.",
