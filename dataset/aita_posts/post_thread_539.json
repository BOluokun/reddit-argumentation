She brought along my other best friend , her brother. For some reason i cant remember, he decided he was going to eat the crusts of the pizza bc hes vegan. My mom used to make the pizza dough with eggs in it, and I completely forgot at the time. He had just became vegan and we would sometimes forget. So he ate the pizza crusts and neither me nor his sister thought much of it bc we forgot there were eggs in the dough. A couple days later his sister and i got to talking and we realized that the dough at eggs. Now here\u2019s where i accept we might have been the a**holes. We decided not to tell him bc hes a very petty person and as much as i love the guy, he holds a grudge like no one else. And we did not do it on purpose. \nA couple months ago we told him bc somehow the conversation led there and he was very mad at us but he decided to talk to us after a couple of days.\nI told this story to my friend tonight and she says that we were the a**holes for forgetting he was vegan.\nSo AITA for forgetting my friend is vegan when eating pizza?",
