  "post content": "My twins (both 11m) have started this thing on the weekends where they wake up at the ass crack of dawn and wake me up because they\u2019re hungry. Most of the time, I get up and make them food but sometimes (like today) I don\u2019t feel very well and I tell them to make themselves some cereal, make something microwaveable, or grab a snack until I fully wake up. (I\u2019m a slow riser\u2014 I can\u2019t just get up and go) They refuse and keep demanding I get up and make them food. My partner believes that I\u2019m in the right when I do this and that they\u2019re 100% capable of feeding themselves. While I\u2019m honestly not sure. I understand that eating something cooked by your mom is special and an act of love and maybe that\u2019s why the boys are so pushy about it. I admittedly have a hard time finding the line between coddling my kids and pushing them to have more independence. So that is why I\u2019m here, looking for outside opinions.\n\nAdding a little edit: Had a talk with the kiddos. They were jealous that my sister does big buffet style breakfasts on the weekends when they stay over. I explained that she does that because 1.) They\u2019re there and 2.) Her kids are still small and NEED their mom to make them breakfast. They apologized for being A-holes. They\u2019re sick and not feeling good and wrongfully took those feelings out on me. I appreciate some of the tough love I\u2019ve got and got some inspiration on how to discuss this with them and I even appreciate the big AHs taking jabs at my parenting. I\u2019m not perfect and there\u2019s definitely things I can do better and now I feel happy with the outcome of this. We\u2019ll see how next weekend goes.",

It\u2019s normal for them to push back, but as they grow older they\u2019ll become more independent if you set them on the right track. Good luck!",

They're 11-- that's completely inappropriate. It's basic courtesy not to wake other people up, and they need to see you as a human being with feelings and needs. My kids knew by around 6yo that on weekends, they did not wake me or their dad up before 9, and they did not ask us for anything until we had drunk our coffee (barring emergencies). It's a matter of respect. I treat them the same way now that they're teens and starting to enjoy sleeping in. \n\nAre they insistent about other things?

Those are skills that develop over time through doing things where if they don\u2019t get it right, they don\u2019t burn down the house. Until those skills are sufficiently developed, the stove unsupervised is simply not safe even if they are a gourmet chef with it when supervised. Our kid wasn\u2019t really safe with it until he was 13 because he\u2019d just forget he had it on, etc. when he was younger.\n\nLack of a stove is also not a significant barrier to making plenty of tasty food items. It is not stopping these kids from making themselves breakfast.",
