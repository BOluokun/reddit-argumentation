  "post content": "So this needs some context. Disclaimer, the guy I\u2019ve been bringing home knows my ex exists and knows he stays at my place but I don\u2019t tell my ex anything. \nSo the background is that me and my ex were together for 3 years, we have a child together, and overall I think he\u2019s a good guy, he\u2019s intelligent and stable so a month ago we moved out for the very first time to a big city in an apartment. Neither one of us knowing anyone in the city, knowing he\u2019s from Indiana and I was moving from 40 minutes away, it was a dream to be in a city this big. \n\nHe works in food. And I get it, the time you come home always varies when you work a full time schedule and you close and work with shitty people. His job sucks and he works 30 minutes away so I try to not say anything to him when he comes home at 2:30 am. But when I would bring it up we would always fight because he has a history of cheating on me in the past multiple times so of course I worry and his argument is always \u201cwe just moved, I don\u2019t know anyone here.\u201d But then it kept happening. He\u2019s a recovering alcoholic. About 3 weeks ago he went back to how he use to be in the beginning of our relationship. Every time he stayed out late he\u2019d come home more drunk than the last night and I\u2019d be worried sick about him. \n\nI\u2019m not the obsessive type but I just can\u2019t sleep until he\u2019s home so I\u2019d stay up til 3-4 am sometimes when I work mornings. I started a new job and that was the night he decided to come home at 2:15 am when I had to be up in 5 hours for my first day. It was a big deal. So I looked it up and his work closed at 9. So there\u2019s no reason it\u2019d take that long. I worried so much that I had this horrible pain in my stomach and ran to the bathroom and there was a huge amount of blood. Come to find out I had a miscarriage. So I texted him I was bleeding and in pain and he ignored it and said sorry that his phone was on silent and that he\u2019ll be home soon. That was at 1:35 am so he shows up at 2:15 am. He said he was at a pub and that he was sorry and proceeded to ignore me and stumbled to the bathroom to get in the shower and then broke a shelf trying to get in and tripped and knocked all the shampoo in the bath. We had an argument and like every argument we\u2019ve ever had in the entirety of our relationship it\u2019s me trying to talk to him and then him turning into this person I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s been doing this new thing though where I get mad and his responses are \u201chm? WHat? I don\u2019t know what you said\u201d so I stormed into the bedroom and told myself I was over it and that to forget about it and go to sleep.\n\n I check Instagram and I\u2019m nosey so I\u2019m always checking to see what my friends are liking and I see he started following a stripper from a stripclub that is 3 minutes down the road from us. So I go back in the front room and confront him and he says it\u2019s not important and that I need to go to bed and I\u2019m the most annoying bitch he\u2019s ever met. So all the nights the past month he\u2019s been at \u201cpubs\u201d he was really at this stripclub. Granted I tried to let it go. He\u2019s 22, he has the right to be there and drink. But going alone to a stripclub let alone talk to a stripper enough to get her instagram is a entire different story to me. \nSo we fought and he pushed me for \u201cyelling\u201d because he\u2019s the type of person that thinks people are responsible for their emotions which is true to a point. \nSo fast forward to now. He never apologized or put some light on the topic. I\u2019ve considered myself single every since that day and I\u2019ve been going on dates with this guy. But my ex still lives with me. He comes home and acts like we\u2019re dating and I made it to where I didn\u2019t let him touch me or call me honey anymore and he slept on the couch for about a week before he came home drunk one night and came into my room and threw himself on me. I was really mad but I let him do what he wanted and then we slept together and the next morning I was happy. But I\u2019ve promised myself I\u2019m never going to date him again. \n\nMy best friend came over about 3 days ago and she knew everything and she hates my ex now. We were sitting on the couch so my ex does this thing where he\u2019s a smug asshole and says we\u2019re dating and expects things from me. He kept calling me honey in front of her and told me to be safe and have a good day with my other boyfriends and said if I didn\u2019t stop being sassy he\u2019d give me \u201ca finger later\u201d. Guy thinks he\u2019s a total comedian. So he stood and stared at me while me and my friend were putting makeup on (I\u2019m obviously ignoring him because he\u2019s leaving for work and wants something) so he bends down to kiss me and I let him without looking. I\u2019ve told him we\u2019re not dating. And he says we are and he won\u2019t move out so I play his game. I watch movies with him, I let him touch me, I let him do what he wants. But I\u2019ve been going on dates with this guy I really see something with. I haven\u2019t told my ex anything but I really want this guy to stay the night especially because he doesn\u2019t have a tv and there\u2019s some classics I want to watch with him but I\u2019m scared of the outcome. My friends say bring him over and tell my ex to fuck off but they\u2019re in college so I think they\u2019re just being dark about the situation. \nAlso: the apartment is in my name I think that\u2019s essential. \nAITA? There will probably be mixed answers but I expect it. ",
