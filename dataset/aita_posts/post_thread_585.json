So my mom called for dinner today (wasnt actually done, no biggie), I came into the kitchen and she was cooking what I assumed was fajitas, it smelled kinda like them but not really. So I come walk up to the pan with the fajita filling where she is and ask her if theres enough paprika and garlic in it (we spice everything in our house thats not sweet with a lot of those 2, so things seem off when we cant smell them). She replied to my statement with \"Why do you have to complain all the time?\" Her voice was raised and I wasnt sure why. I responded with \"that wasnt a complaint I was trying to help.\" To try to stop her from yelling. This didnt work as I just kept getting yelled at (I sat in silence) at the dinner table. So this is probably a biased story in some way, but I seriously dont get what the hell is going on, am I the a hole here?",
