  "post content": "I am 24M and I have a friend who is 21, she is really nice and we've known each other for a year. She is my sister's acquaintance and we met at my sister's birthday party. I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back.\n\nLast week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down. \n\nToday, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.\n\nWhen I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my \"friend\" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want?\n\n**EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed...\n\nBut the part where she says she\u2019s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she\u2019ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**",

Don't be surprised if you lose a friend over this.\n\nEdit- thank you for the silver! \n\nP.S. since some keep making mocking comments about toxic masculinity, I'll break it down. 'Only guys understand' implies that guys would obviously take the choice that gets them laid. He doesn't even really like the other girl, he just knows he stands a good chance at some action. That's a really gross way to view women. I hope the other girl does end your friendship, because she deserves better friends, that don't sexualize her.\n\nEdit 2. Holy crap, my inbox. Stop it. Thank you for all of the awards. To the 350 ppl in my inbox that called me a feminazi, you may think I'm full of crap, or your feelings are hurt, but 8k+ people show you're the minority and probably part of the problem.",

But if he's openly saying that he wants to date someone, and they do not reciprocate that feeling, then it's very realistic for him to say \"okay\" and move on.",

And if he was going to take a friend to the show it doesn\u2019t sound like this girl was a particularly close one anyway and he probably had closer friends who he would have had a better time going with.

I'm not saying you can't ask her out on a date, but including hotel reservations for a single room in a first date is YTA material for me.  You kind of turned these concert tickets to a band she loves into \"fuck me and you can live your dream.\"\n\nAs far as the secondary situation, she declined your offer and asked if you could go as friends.  I think you should have given her a clear yes/no to that before moving on, but I don't think that would make you an asshole in and of itself.\n\nAs for what your sister was saying, I disagree.  They are your tickets.  It would be nice if you to use them to help your friend see the band she loves, but it's not a duty.  Going to the concert with someone who wants to be there because she likes you is a valid decision.  Also the fact that she turned you down is a reason to not go with her.  That might make the concert very awkward for both of you and ruin the experience.  You are allowed to be hurt by her rejection of you and let it affect your friendship (but not allowed to retaliate against her for it or otherwise be an asshole to her because of it).\n\nLast, separate from the judgement about the specific situation, the way you write about this makes me think you are an asshole.  It doesn't sound like you care much about either woman you asked out except as people who might have sex with you.  I don't know you.  Maybe this is just an artifact of you trying to put the situation down bluntly.  I'm also not saying you can't have a relationship just about sex - I just think using concert tickets as a lever to achieve that is a pretty shitty thing to do.

If it was simply a matter of one girl not wanting it to be a date, so he asked another girl who did want to date him, then I think more people would have said NAH. His feelings on being rejected, the hotel situation, and his overall tone in the original post seem to have clouded over what could have been a straightforward question. Is he an asshole in general? Possibly. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole for wanting to bring a girl that is interested vs. a platonic friend.",

I really don't understand how this is \"toxic masculinity.\" He clearly asked her out on a date and she doesn't want to date him, he's not obligated to take her just because she really likes the band. I can see how having a hotel reservation near a concert would be really ideal (if you're going to have to drive to different city for the concert, planning on drinking, and given how late some concerts go). Also, some women and men like to get laid on the first date. Yup, women too. And there's nothing wrong with that. It seems like some people are almost slut-shamming the girl who's interested in him for saying yes. He probably should have first asked if she wanted to go to the concert with him as a date, waited for an answer, and if yes then offer to reserve a hotel room. But the way he asked doesn't make him TA here. Frankly, she's TA for asking to still go with him as friends. It just seems cruel to say no to a date and then expect to go as a friend, but maybe that's just me. I know I wouldn't want to go with a guy I asked as a date and he just wanted to go as friends. I think it would have the whole experience really awkward and less enjoyable. Just because a guy asks, a woman isn't obligated to yes to a date. And in return the guy isn't obligated to still take the woman out but just as friends. \n\nNTA, hope you have fun on the date.",

She didn\u2019t say \u201cyeah I\u2019d love to go as a date, just not comfortable sharing a hotel room,\u201d she said she did not want it to be a date in any form. If sharing a hotel room is really the concern, there\u2019s far better ways to express it.\n\n2. Sharing a hotel room doesn\u2019t automatically imply sex or even wanting sex. If the concert was far away, or if they were planning on drinking at the concert, a hotel might be a good option. Nothing in OPs post indicated that he specifically wanted to fuck her on the first date.\n\n3. From what it sounds like, OP has known this girl for a bit anyways. It\u2019s not like he just met this girl yesterday and asked her to go stay in a hotel with him. He said he\u2019s known her for a year prior, presumably hanging out with her as a friend and such. So yes it still would be a \u201cfirst date\u201d but it\u2019s FAR less weird sounding than people are making it out as.\n\n4. I find it strange that OP is being criticized for telling her she doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to date as a man. Women are literally *praised* for telling men \u201cyou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to go through child birth,\u201d or \u201cyou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be harassed as a woman,\u201d or \u201cyou don\u2019t know what we go through to get ready every day.\u201d But as soon as he says \u201cI\u2019m a dude, I think I know what it\u2019s like being a dude better than you,\u201d he\u2019s displaying toxic masculinity? Wtf is that?\n\n5. Most people would be annoyed after getting rejected. Are we really gonna pretend there\u2019s any sizable amount of people who don\u2019t get bothered by rejection? It sucks, and he\u2019s rightfully upset that she didn\u2019t want to go on a *date* with him. Nothing about his post implied that he was just pissed that she won\u2019t fuck him. Because again - she could have easily brought up her uncomfortableness with a hotel room and still gone on a date. He even said himself that he was fine with it in the edit.",

A guy can say one thing and be totally respectful, and then turn into a total \u201cniceguy\u201d later. As a girl sometimes you have to expect that the guy expects sex, and act accordingly for your own safety. \n\nYes, adults are capable to maturely share a room without sex a city over, but since he wanted it to be a date, it\u2019s not unreasonable to worry that he might change his mind and expect sex. Sometimes its hard to clearly communicate no when your basically stranded in a hotel room with a guy, you might even feel like you owe hime sex even if you don\u2019t want to. Her saying no to the date might have just been to cover her bases that absolutely nothing would happen in the hotel. \n\nHow ever everyone is right in saying there is nothing wrong in meeting up for sex between two consenting adults.
