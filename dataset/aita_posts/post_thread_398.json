  "post content": "I (M 39) have been married to my wife Stacey (F 30) for 5 years and we have 2 children together. I also share 3 children with my ex wife Hannah (F 37). Ever since Stacey and I got together she has made it very clear to me that my 3 children are mine and Hannah's responsibility, not hers. This has worked out well so far, but lately it has been taking a toll on me.\n\nI pay Hannah child support every month, ever since Stacey had our first child she has demanded that I give her the same amount of money each month to keep things \"fair\". In addition, I have to pay for half of our joint household expenses (ie mortgage, utilities, food) and my own car. Stacey pays for the majority of expenses for our children. \n\nHere lies the problem. Stacey has never taking issues with having to care for mine and Hannah's children. She picks them up from school, takes them to activities, and ensures they have everything they need. However, anytime she purchases anything for them, she immediately sends me a Venmo request and demands I cover all expenses related to children that are \"not hers\". We recently went on a family vacation and she demanded that I pay for half of the portion for our children and all of the portion for Hannah's. I told her that all theses expenses are taking a hit in my finances and she didn't seem to care. She reiterated that my children are my responsibility.\n\nTo add insult to injury, she recently started contributing money to college funds for her kids, while Hannah and I have nothing saved for our kids' college. Hannah found out and asked that I start funds for our kids. When I talked with Stacey about this, she said this was fine, but I had to put the same amount of money in the funds she has set up for our kids.\n\nI told Stacey I need her to start paying her fair share of expenses around our household. I cannot afford to pay child support, household expenses, and all these miscellaneous expenses that come up for my kids. It wouldn't hurt her financially, as she makes more than me and could easily spare some money. Stacey blew up and took our children to her parent's house and I haven't heard from her in a day and a half. Am I the asshole for demanding that she pay her fair share?",

One side will either \"nacho\" (not my kid not my problem), or one side will set a reasonable boundary like this one and the other will push it to inconvenience the other to see what they can get away with. \n\nReminds me of a recent one about stepkiddos needing dinner, the father demanding their stepmother make them something, she couldn't because she was working, he left them hungry and INSTRUCTED the kids to badger their stepmom for food, and he blew up on her when she got them take out. \n\nOP's wife set the boundary that she is NOT paying for stepkids activities/food/cloths/etc and that OP needs to contribute to HALF of their shared childrens activities/etc. OP AGREED to this arrangement (a fair one I might add) and is now pushing back because he's feeling the pressure. \n\nInstead of demanding she contribute, you both need to sit down and come up with a less stressful way to communicate about finances. Maybe a monthy budget for all kids activities. 250 for bio kids and 500 for step kiddos from OP. These are examples obviously, IDK what their extra curricular activities are, if they are in a HCOL area, many factors, yada yada.",

OP calls it \u201cchild support\u201d to make it sounds like Stacey is in the wrong, but essentially he is just contributing to his children\u2019s expenses. What OP wants is for Stacey to pay for *their* children and for him to only contribute to his kids with Hannah. That\u2019s what he thinks is \u201cfair.\u201d I get that he doesn\u2019t have very much money leftover after paying household expenses, child support etc, but no one forced him to have five kids. The only area I see wiggle room in is to split household expenses proportionally, as a lot of couples split expenses equitably and not equally, but it\u2019s not wrong for Stacey to want an equal split if that\u2019s what they agreed to.",

She's being awesome on not denying the step kids things in the moment, and is keeping OP honest behind the scenes. She's involved in the steps' lives and is supporting them in none financial ways.\n\nOP, though, he's got 5 kids. And it looks like though he sets aside the same amount of money for each child that's then given to the mother, Stacey is able to provide a more affluent lifestyle to her bio kids than Hannah is to hers. Hannah seems to resent this, because a college fund will most likely significantly change the trajectory of Stacey's bio kids compared to Hannah's bio kids. That's an understandable thing to feel envy over.\n\nSo Hannah asks why Stacey's bios have funds but her bios don't. Answer, neither Hannah nor OP ever opened one, but Stacey did. So OP and Hannah should do so now.\n\nTo which Stacey asks why OP should fund 3 of his children's educations, but not all 5? Also fair.\n\nOP, you have two ways out of this without violating your long standing agreement with Stacey. One, you tell Hannah that as Stacey is funding her bios' education on her own, Hannah will have to as well. Or, you contribute equally to all 5 educations.\n\nAnd if you can't keep up with expenses, it's time to re-evaluate either your lifestyle or your job. You either have to make cuts that are agreeable to Stacey or you need more income. You can't blame Stacey for the fact that raising 5 kids is expensive, you chose to have 5 kids.",

Your other three children are not her responsibility. \n\nShe already picks them up from school, watches them, and presumably feeds them. She's doing you a solid. \n\nIf you don't have the finances to make your prior three children college funds, you shouldn't have had five kids. Stacey is smart and looking out for her children's future.",
