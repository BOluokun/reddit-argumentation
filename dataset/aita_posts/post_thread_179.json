  "post content": "Please try not to spread this around elsewhere but if you really find it that amusing then I can't stop you Ig. This is embarrassing \n(also my English isn't that great, sorry about that) \n\n\nOk ok, so before you say anything, I know this sounds really weird but shit happends. Basically what happend was that my brother (18) and his friend ate some bad muffins and they started vomiting and uh... Pooping.. alot. His friend went home but when my brother tried to shower some kind of explosion happened \ud83d\udc80 For some reason our mom didn't ask him clean it up (she never makes us do anything) but she had a long day and really didn't feel like cleaning. I (15 f) really wanted/needed to shower (girl stuff, iykyk) but when I asked our mom about it she got mad at me for \"bossing her around\", I kept (nicely) asking if she could please just make him clean it but she kept insisting that it wasn't that bad. I went to look and I'll admit, it wasn't so bad. Just some splatter (I know \ud83e\udd22) on the wall and some dark stains here and there, but the thing is I CAN NOT handle stuff like that. At all. I almost vomited and I was begging my mom to clean it so i could shower, I thought it was a reasonable request to let me not have to shower in literal shit but apparently not. It turned into a fight, she kept yelling at me that she's tired and I'm being a crybaby and bossing her around. I was already in a bad mood and I *needed* the shower, so I started crying and yelling her to stop and that this was really mean (I'm really sensitive and can't handle being yelled at). She eventually cleaned it up, I don't know why she didn't make my brother do it, considering he was feeling ok. So, am I the ass hole for yelling back at her and not wanting to shower with literal shit?",

In that case, the brother should have cleaned it anyway and OP should have womaned up and tried to facilitate that. \nIf the above is the case, then OP\u2019s mom is NTA either. \n\nAssuming story and ages checked out, OP should have talked to her brother first and tried to solve issue. Or cared for him if he was that sick. Many kids would have talked to each other first. \n\nAs a parent and having adulted early myself, I can\u2019t imagine being 18 and NOT cleaning it up. I can\u2019t imagine being 16 and not dying of shame at the thought of leaving this mess for someone else. \nI can imagine my kids asking for help, but if a kid of mine came to me like this I\u2019d try to use it as a parenting opportunity to both kids. Lessons would be care for sick loved ones/ cleaning up after yourself from here on out and here\u2019s how/ how to ask things in a respectful manner and try to problem solve. \n\nYes OP\u2019s parent shouldn\u2019t make her clean it but honestly, I\u2019d like the mom\u2019s perspective. \nIt\u2019s possible mom is an insensitive jerk. But who knows how much of this is perception and misinterpretation or misrepresentation. \n\nI feel like there\u2019s not enough info about OP\u2019s contact or lack thereof w brother and the response she got. \n\nSo unlikely to be TAH, but if mom is single, slammed, beyond tired, and OP didn\u2019t go to brother first then OP is behaving in a distasteful manner. \nShe doesn\u2019t HAVE to shower. I\u2019ve been  in situations where I couldn\u2019t, and I made do w the sink and a towel in a pinch. Ideal world- every kid should have a clean shower always. Always. But sometimes life doesn\u2019t work that way for one evening. \n\nTLDR: I want to say NTA but there\u2019s not enough info really.",
