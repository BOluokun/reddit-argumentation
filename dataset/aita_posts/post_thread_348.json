  "post content": "Me (26m) and my wife (24f) have been married for 4 years. During those 4 years she had the same job which requires her to be away Friday to Sunday, so she leaves early on Friday and returns about 4-5pm on Sunday. Occasionally it would be leaving on Saturday and returning Sunday. She also has to work some of the school/public holidays.\n\nI work full time and get just a bit above minimum wage and tips, so our bills are split 60 (her) to 40(me). While I find myself struggling with money and having to have to borrow from the joint bank account, my wife never have this problem. I know she is getting paid more then I do as she works for a high profile client, but I'm not sure by how much more. She also wouldn't tell me what exactly she is doing, all I know is that it is connected to her degree and it is 100% not a sex work or nothing in that industry. The reason why she won't tell me is because she signed the contract and it is highly confidential so she is not allowed to go into details.\n\nShe does chores around the house but doesn't cook (she admits herself she is a bad cook and hates it), instead she would order either those premade healthy meals you then heat up for herself or takeaway. When I'm home and she hasn't ordered she will order for me too. So most of the day while I'm working she is either in our house chilling (watching TV, playing video games, reading or exercising) or shopping or in the gym.\n\nOver the years I got annoyed with this and have asked her to find another job so she has something to do while I'm working instead of wasting her day. She told me she is not wasting her day but relaxing and her job pays her enough so she can afford the lifestyle she wants. I said it is not fair on me, as I come home tired while she has done nothing all day, to which she said I can find another job or a different job but I am an asshole for wanting her to find another job because I feel tired when coming back from my work, when she has already got a job she loves.\n\nAfter she won't talk to me. I have spoken to my family and while my parents agree with me that she needs to work, my sisters took my wife's side and called me a massive asshole.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying she needs to quit the job she has. I'm saying she needs to find another job to do during her freetime, could be a part time one, since she doesn't really do much during the day.",

In fact, it makes it worse.",

Right now, OP is struggling to make ends meet, because he has a low-paying job. Meanwhile his partner can seemingly easily make ends meet, *and* has time to relax. Their stress levels aren't balanced.\n\nThis does *not* mean that OPs partner should find a new job, or a second job, or whatever. OPs struggles are valid, but his solution is nonsense. What they need to do is have a talk about their partnership. Maybe partner could pay even larger portion, maybe she could entirely support him while he looks for a better job, maybe just some realignment of values. Or maybe this relationship doesn't work at all and they should break up? But they need to talk.",
