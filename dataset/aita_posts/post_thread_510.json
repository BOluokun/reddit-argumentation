  "post content": "So, I am responsible for doing the shifts roster where I work. I'm not a manager, and I don't get extra money for doing this, it just has always been the rule here that the roster is done internally (i.e. by the employees themselves, not by the boss). We are only a small facility with a handful of employees (can't explain what we do exactly, as I don't want to risk being identified). One of the employees has moved on to another department in the same company, and she used to do the roster, so when she left, as the person who has been here longest and who knows how things work, it made sense for me to take over doing it.\n\nA new person is coming to replace her, and I messaged her to ask her to give me the dates she wants to go on leave. Now, an important part of this is that we used to be able to afford to have 2 people go on leave at the same time, but one of the other employees has been unwell and had to take indefinite leave. The powers that be have said he will not be replaced, so my boss has said that from now on, we can only have 1 person away on leave. I had submitted my leave to my boss a few days ago and he said it was fine (this was a verbal agreement, however, which I admit was a mistake on my part). Now the new girl is also requesting leave on the same dates. I explained the situation to her and she doesn't want to budge.\n\nShe said she is going on holiday, it's already booked (plane tickets, accommodation, everything) and all non-refundable, so she would lose a lot of money if she cancels. My plans for my time off are that I'm going to a friend's wedding. I have paid for plane tickets, but I'm staying with another friend, so no accommodation costs. The guy getting married is a childhood friend and my guy best friend, and I'm also friends with his fiancee (in fact, I introduced them), and I'm a groomslady (best man is our other best friend). \n\nI feel like an a\\*hole saying no to her, especially because I feel like I now have power as the person doing the roster, and I don't want to abuse it. In previous cases, when there was such an issue, the person doing the roster would sacrifice him/her self, because otherwise people comment that they are abusing their power, and I don't want to do that. On the other hand, I would feel absolutely awful not going to my friend's wedding. I don't want new girl to resent me forever, but I know if I give in and don't go to the wedding I will resent her instead.\n\nI could involve my boss, but he may very well say we should sort this out between us, or flip a coin, or something along those lines. So, would I be the A\\*hole if I told her she can't take that time off?\n\nPS Please don't say it should be up to our boss to figure this out, or it should be up to the higher ups to get a new hire to fill in for the person who is unwell and had to go on indefinite leave. I get that that is what *should* happen, but it's not going to. No, I cannot leave my job and find another one (for various reasons).",

But that's not the case, and working around a new hire's existing commitment she paid for is an onboarding issue, not so much a scheduling issue. Unless your boss makes you change your plans, I wouldn't do it, and I'd also bring it to them because if they think its worthwhile, they are the ones with the ability to make something work for the window when you both have commitments, because it's worth it to them in the longer term to have both of you on the roster.",

If she sprung the news as a sudden, unplanned request, then sucks for her.  Ultimately, it is up to management/HR to make the final determination & they're entirely inappropriate for placing you or anyone else in that position to begin with.  Frankly, if she made her request known beforehand & they also approved your leave, then you BOTH each should proceed with your individual plans & let HR/Management actually do THEIR job & suck it up.  \n\nIt can't be determined if you're an asshole or not, until those questions are answered.",

          "content": "So, I used the word \"company\" to describe it because I'm a bit unsure of the correct English word. It's more of a government agency (not sure if that is exactly the right term either). This job is part of training for a professional certification. We don't get hired by HR. We get assigned to different posts by our training body. So there is no interview (except the initial interview when you apply to be accepted to do this certification). Every person (depending on what specific certification they are doing) will get assigned to different posts, eg. 6 months in post A, 3 months in post B etc. They assign you based on what the requirements for your certification are and based on what posts are open at the time. There is an HR here but they don't really deal with people doing the certification training, except for certain specific things (for example, salaries, making sure our paperwork is correct, that we have clearance to work etc) but they don't deal with our rosters or our transfers. So first time anyone heard about her leave here was me when I asked her. The thing is, what usually happens (at least what most do when they transfer to a new place), people will start work first and then establish that their leave is secure and approved before booking stuff, like trips etc. Or if they are eager to book something, they will try to contact someone ahead of time to check. Not sure why she didn't do that.",

But she MAY also not be the asshole because it sounds like procedures are very loose & there is no proper hierarchy or accountability.
