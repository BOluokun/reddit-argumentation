  "post content": "I\u2019m 22 and she\u2019s 25. My sister (Mia)\u2019s son is 7 months old and the father is not in her baby\u2019s life at all. He basically dipped the week after the baby was born. I\u2019ve been supporting the both of them financially while my sister Mia gets back on her feet and looks for a job to pay the bills all on her own.\n\nFast forward to 2 days ago, she calls me excitedly, telling me she has big news. Deep down in my heart I already knew what she was about to say and my intuition was confirmed when she said she was pregnant again.\n\nShe went on and on about how she met a new guy she hadn\u2019t told me about and how nice he treats her and the baby. That she really feels like he\u2019s the one and how she can\u2019t wait for the family she was supposed to have.\n\nI basically laid it out straight to her. She hasn\u2019t been dating this guy for very long, and yet she\u2019s already pregnant and wanting to marry him simply because he treats her and the baby \u201cnicely\u201d. He isn\u2019t helping with bills, or providing in anyway. This was not likely to last and she\u2019ll be a single mom of 2. Not to mention how dangerous it is to get pregnant this soon after giving birth.\n\nShe told me I was being \u201cfake\u201d and that I wasn\u2019t acting like family. That I should support her like our mother is. Turns out, our mother is kissing her ass and only enforcing the rose colored glasses Mia has on the situation. Telling her stories of how our stepdad only knew her for 2 months before he married her and blah blah. \n\nI told her that I can\u2019t support her or any other children should she decide to go through with this. I essentially said \u201cI\u2019m not pressuring you into anything. This is your choice, but I refuse to be financing this choice. You\u2019re on your own Mia. I can\u2019t enable you digging yourself further in holes you can\u2019t climb out of cause of irresponsible unplanned pregnancies and I refuse to\u201d\n\nOf course, she didn\u2019t take that well. Started crying and saying how I just don\u2019t want her to be happy, how much of a bitch I am and hung up. Our mother isn\u2019t very happy with me now. I do feel bad. I don\u2019t think I worded it the best, nor should I have called her irresponsible. \n\nI\u2019m just at my breaking point. AITA?",

The mother is also delusional - it's nice that her own quick relationship actually worked out but if she wants the same thing for her daughter, she should be the one providing for her. I assume that's why she's angry at OP - she's eager to support Mia emotionally (because that costs nothing) but she doesn't want to spend her money on her.",

When she's just one year past being able to buy herself a drink? Not to mention that their mother is completely on board with Mia, and upset with OP for deciding to cut her off financially? Many other sisters would've completely lost it on her! It also sounds like Mia and the mother are probably closer and more alike, therefore I wouldn't be surprised if she always has Mia's back when she makes bonehead decisions. Their mother emphasizing that she also got married after 2 months while Mia is fantasizing about her new beau is completely irresponsible. Yes, meeting someone, falling in love, getting married after 3 weeks and having 40 years of wedded bliss does happen, but unions like this are the exception, not the rule, and everyone knows this. Heck, I got married at 19, closed escrow on my first home at 22 while my husband and I were expecting our first child, and have managed to have an absolutely wonderful 26 year marriage with 3 amazing children, but I would NEVER advocate for my children to attempt to follow in our footsteps...ever. My husband and I have been incredibly blessed, and I'm old enough to know how rare our love story is. The likelihood that our children will be able to repeat our good fortune with odds such as extreme youth and still being in college is slight, and the same is true for OP's sister Mia. I truly hope she will be the exception, but she is stacking the odds against herself on top of the one's life already has. Not to mention that she's doing all this will being financially supported by her little sister? Her audacity and lack of responsibility boggles the mind, frankly. I think she needs a wake up call and fast, because she seems to be forgetting one crucial factor: She is about to be responsible for the care and well-being of 2 children! She's got to start making better choices, yesterday, because children need money and stability, she doesn't have either, and she doesn't seem to be concerned about her lack of them. She's got mammoth issues to overcome and she seems completely clueless. Her poor children; I hope she gets her head out of the sand very soon...",
