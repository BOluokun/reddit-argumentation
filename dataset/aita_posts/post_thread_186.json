  "post content": "Last month while pregnant, I went to my  39 week checkup. The doctor had been concerned because the baby was not in the right position for birth. So I was told that they were going to do an \"external cephalic version\" (ECV), which is when the doctor uses her hands on the belly to cause pressure for the baby to move into the right position. While doing this, I was being monitored by their computer,  and the baby's heart was also being monitored.  It was very uncomfortable but I know the doctor was being safe. \n\nUltimately, it did not work, so they scheduled a c-section for the following week, but told me that if the baby had moved to the right position by then, they would induce me for a vaginal birth.\n\nThe day of the ECV, I told my extended family including my MIL. She is from Mexico and likes to do traditional home remedies and treatments for her ailments.  One of the traditions she has is visiting a \"sobadora\". Which is like a masseuse that claims to fix many problems using their herbal oils and chiropractic techniques. Well she suggested that I go to this woman to turn the baby, and that way I could avoid the c-section.\n\nI told her many times that day that I wouldn't trust someone to work on my belly without monitoring my baby's heart. I thought she understood that I was against this idea, but the following morning she knocked at my door and she had the sobadera lady with her.\n\nI tried to be nice to them and tried to explain how I wasn't comfortable letting her touch me, but they kept insisting.  It got to the point that i was so angry that I yelled at both of them to leave because the sobadera was not a doctor and she is not qualified to do any treatment on me. They left, but my MIL called me an ungrateful snob.\n\nThe following week my baby had still not moved, so I did end up getting a c-section. But my baby is healthy and I am grateful to the doctors who helped deliver her to me safely. \n\nBut now it's been a couple weeks since my argument with my MIL, and even though she loves on the baby, she is very short with me and she told me I should apologize for how rude I was to her. I don't want to apologize because I feel she was the one who was out of line. My husband was always supportive of my decision and was backing me up, but somehow,  my MIL still doesn't get that she was inappropriate in what she was asking me to do. My sister in laws both said that I should have given it a chance since it could have helped me avoid the c-section, and that I acted like a-hole to the sobadora my saying she wasn't a doctor.\n\nSo AITAH for the way I refused the traditional treatment?",

What else would they have wanted you to do to get rid of them \"more politely\" when they refused to leave? Politely and quietly call the police and request that they get physically dragged out and arrested?\n\nThere is a time and a place for traditional medicine. However, when there is such a significant possibility of harm to your unborn child that the doctor was monitoring the baby's heartbeat when he performed this procedure, there is no chance I would have allowed this unknown person to practice on me and my child in your situation. \n\nI assume your MIL meant well. However she is absolutely wrong. She refused to respect your boundaries, demanded that you allow her to risk harming you and your baby regardless of what you chose, and is throwing a rudeness tantrum because you defied her when you had every right and an obligation to do so. Her judgement is so far gone right now that I would not allow unsupervised contact with your child.\n\nI hope someone can explain this to her so that she understands.",

Now if one is in a village in Mexico with no doctors or hospitals, I\u2019m not gonna judge, but as the above terrifying account from u/MormorTrine clearly demonstrates, this is not a technique to be attempted without extreme care and under very specific medical conditions. \n\nOP: NTA. \n\nIn cases like these respect by submission to cultural practices is not warranted, you mama did well. Let\u2019s hope MIL can move on soon. Congratulations on your new addition! ( autocorrect said \u201cadventure\u201d- haha! ) \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc95",

I'm my mom's first child (she lacked experience in knowing how the birth should be like) and doctors treatment my mom horribly saying it was not time to start pushing. She kept saying the left side of her body felt numb. Doctors and nurses kept ignoring her.The result? My mom had a heart attack and they had to deal with both the heart issue and me being born. I didn't cry. No one told my mom what had happened to the baby. My godmother had to chase doctors around the hospital to find out what had happened. My mom only got to see me 9 hours after my birth and I was \"all covered in bruises\". Not actual bruises. There was an issue with the umbilical cord, it was too short and I nearly died. So did my mom. The c-section saved both our lives.",
