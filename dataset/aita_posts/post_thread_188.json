  "post content": " I 30F and my boyfriend 38M are having a disagreement and I need an outsiders viewpoint. My boyfriend is a single father of two children 17M and 4M. They are great kids and really don\u2019t have anything to do with the story. Just needed to be mentioned for context. I do not have any children.\nBeing a single father, he works two full-time jobs to support his kids. I also have two jobs, but I work significantly less as they are both rather well paying and have less expenses. As we both work a lot, you can imagine we don\u2019t get to spend a lot of time together. This definitely puts a strain on our relationship, but we have tried our best to make it work as we both love each other deeply.\n\nSince I have more free time, I tend to spend a lot of this free time with my two closest friends. Both of whom are stay at home wives. We like to go to brunches, spa days, movie nights, festivals. Basically, just having fun and enjoying life. My boyfriend often jokes about my \u201clife of frivolity\u201d and \u201cwishes he could have as much fun as I do\u201d\n\nLately, he\u2019s been trying to convince me to use some of my free time to get another job so he can take time off of work because he would like to do those things with me. He said, \u201cwith all my free time a part-time job making like a few hundred bucks a week shouldn\u2019t be so hard\u201d and he would be able to work less and spend more time with me. While I would love to spend more time with my boyfriend and can admit that secretly, sometimes I would prefer to be out doing these things with him. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s fair that I get another job to subsidize his income. He immediately got defensive and told me it wasn\u2019t like that I didn\u2019t understand because I don\u2019t have kids and that he needed to work as much as he did for his children.\n\nThis is where I may have been an A**hole. I told him it was ridiculous for him to expect me to pay to spend time with him. He told me I was being childish and not listening to the situation. Simply he could not afford to work less, and desperately wanted to spend more time with me. He figured since I could earn more money in less time than he could that I should work a little more so he could work a little less. I again told him I would not pay to spend time with him and the conversation and quickly deteriorated. \n\nI just need to know  AITA?\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nWe\u2019ve been together about a year and we live about 45 minutes apart \n\nHe does work 80 hours a week \nI work anywhere from 35-45 hours a week\n\nMe agreeing and working an extra 10-15 hours a week would mean he would only have to work around 60 hours.\n\nWe do not share finances\n\nHe is overall a great boyfriend, and I do see myself spending the rest of my life with him. \n\nWe have openly talked about the future together. \n\nEdit 2:\n\nHe is actively looking for ways to earn more and work less\n\nThis would be \u201ctemporary\u201d, but there\u2019s no saying how long ",

Let me get this straight; your boyfriend wants you to get a **third** job, **give him the money from said third job so he can work less,** and then spend what little free time you have left with him, thus cutting out your time spent pursuing your own interests and hobbies with your friends.  \n\nWhy would he even think you would, or should, do such a thing?  Your bf apparently thinks he hit the cash lottery with you.  Your bf is the AH.",

      "content": "NTA. You are being taken for granted.\n\nIn a relationship, it's important for both partners to support each other, but this doesn't necessarily mean taking on additional work to subsidize the other's income. Your time is valuable, and how you choose to spend it is up to you, especially since you've worked hard to be in a position where you can enjoy your free time as you see fit.Your boyfriend's situation is undoubtedly challenging, and his desire to spend more time with you is understandable. However, suggesting that you should get another job so he can work less places an unfair burden on you. It's not your responsibility to change your work-life balance to alleviate the pressures of his responsibilities, especially when it comes to financial matters and personal time.\n\nIt's also concerning that he labels your lifestyle as a \"life of frivolity\" and then asks you to alter it for his benefit. A more constructive approach would be for both of you to discuss ways to manage your time together within the current constraints of your lifestyles and work schedules, without expecting one another to make unilateral sacrifices.  \n\n\nThe conversation might have deteriorated, but it seems this was due to the strain of the situation rather than any intentional wrongdoing on your part. It's worth revisiting this discussion when both of you are calm and can talk about your needs and capabilities without judgment or unrealistic expectations.",
