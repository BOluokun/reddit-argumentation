  "post content": "So, I have a 20-year-old daughter who is currently living with me rent-free while she attends college. When she moved back home, we made a deal where she would cook and clean the house as a form of payment for her living here. She agreed to it, and we both thought it was fair.\n\nHowever, recently, she approached me and said that the cooking and cleaning are taking up too much of her time, making it hard for her to study and complete her homework. She asked if I could reduce the number of days she has to cook to give her more time for her studies.\n\nI told her that she should be grateful for the deal I offered her and that it's not that hard to do a few hours of chores compared to what many kids her age are going through. I pointed out that some of her peers are working 9-5 while going to school simultaneously, and I've given her the luxury of just handling some household chores in exchange for free housing.\n\nShe ended up calling her aunt(my sister) behind my back to complain about how I'm treating her, and my sister called me, and kind of went off on me, basically saying I'm being too strict and should listen to my daughter.\n\nHere's where I'm unsure if I'm being an asshole. I want to stick to the agreement we made, but my sister's words have me questioning my stance. AITA for not wanting to change the deal we initially made? I thought it was a fair deal.\n\nEdit: Well I wasn't expecting this post to blow up. Just to address some things. For one I'm my Daughter's Father, not stepmother. Her mother is no longer with us and I'm currently single. So this isn't a Cinderella story. Two, I'm not sexist for making my daughter cook for my son's who are only children. They don't know how to cook, let alone clean themselves. Three, I'm not trying to take advantage of my daughter. As I said in my post, a lot of people her age would die to be in the position she's in right now. I'm paying for her college and all I expect back from her is a homemade meal. I appreciate the feedback, but a lot of bad assumptions were made about me so I had to clear it up.\n\nEdit 2: After reading a lot of you guy's comments, I'm leaning towards making an ultimatum with my daughter. Either she can get a job and pay some of the rent, so she no longer has to consistently cook & clean anymore or she can continue with the deal I initially offered her. To compromise a little bit, I might change some of the days she has to cook & clean, to days where she has more free time to do so. I believe if she decides to take a 9-5, she will eventually realize just how good the offer I initially made with her was. Some may think I'm being harsh, but my stance is different on that, because at her age I was going to school and I paid full rent by myself with no help from my family. So I believe this to be a fair compromise. ",

She is overwhelmed with the sum of her duties right now. She is just asking you not to have to cook some days of the week, so that she may catch up on her school work. Is that so terribly unreasonable? I don't think so. You could let her not cook in the weekend, the whole arrangement to be evaluated in three months to see how it works for your family. That would be a reasonable arrangement.",

I think OP has a very unrealistic view of what college looks like for most people, especially those who are studying full-time toward a degree.\n\nYes, some college students *do* have full-time jobs as well, but there's almost always some area of life where college students are understandably slacking. It might even be at these full-time jobs OP is referring to. Most I knew definitely didn't cook for themselves on a regular basis and keep their space clean at nearly all times. I was in the same position, too.\n\nNot to mention that OP has clarified in a comment that their daughter is cooking for a whole family, namely two brothers and OP. It sounds like she might be expected to clean the *whole* house, too. So, those responsibilities are largely amplified in comparison to those of a student living on their own.",

I was working approximately 30 hours a week for two months while having a full-time online class load. Oh my god, it was *so* difficult. I ended up weeks behind in all the classes. I realize many people have to do that all the time, but it isn't *easy.* Fortunately me being behind in class was forgiven because in 2020 the professors were being lenient, but students don't have that in 2023.
