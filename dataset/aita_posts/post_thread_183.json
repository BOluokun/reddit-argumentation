And was the biggest supporter after. \n\n\nBut when she was 19 Amber got pregnant. The father wanted nothing to do with it and went completely off the map. \n\n\nAmber didn't want to have a abortion and decide she was going to have the baby. I agreed to help her every step of the way. \n\nBut she then found she was having twins.\n\nThis resulting in her having to drop out of college once she gave brith. \n\nI tried to help to the best of my abilities but I myself was a broke college student.\n\nBecause of this she fell in to a deep depression and treated it with alcohol and eventually drugs. And she start doing stupid thing that put her kids in harm's way. \n\n\nShe never internally hurt the kids  but her action due to her substance abuse have put the kids in extreme danger on mutiple occasions.\n\nShe eventually got reported to DCS by a anonymous party and her kid's were taken from her. \n\n She herself ask me to agree to take them so they wouldn't go into foster care. Which I did. \n\nShe was allowed visitation. But would show up drunk and or high.  This was not a pretty side of her. She say and donstuuf that scared the kids. Would tried to start physical fights with me and my fiancee and on mutiple occasion she down right insult us mostly using homophobic insult on us. \n\nThe she show up high out of her mind talking no sense and tried to run off with the kids and when we wouldn't let her she completely trashed our apartment. That was the last straw.\n\nWe called the cops and she was arrested. \n\n\nMe and my fiancee agree not to press charge if she agreed to give up her custody rights temporarily. \n\nShe agreed to sign the papers \n\nThis all happen over the span of 2 and half years\n\nShe also had a few drug charges that we had no contorl over.  But she ended up getting probation for those and is now posting about how we stole her kids. She still a heavy drug user and has completely converted to homophobia. She tells people we are corruption her children with our reationship. \n\n\nNow here's the part that might make me the asshole. I was the anonymous reporter. I reported her in the first places.  I never thought she lose her kids. As I wasn't aware of how bad she was in the hole with her drug use. I was just hoping the visted might get her to striaghten up her act. \n\n\nEdit: this post should of said temporarily parent rights. Meaning she had the option to get them back of she get sober.\n\n\nSo AITA for \"stealing\" my ex best friend's kids.",

You did the right thing.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: thank you kind people for the awards, this is the most I've ever gotten :,) so nice. I really thought this was gunna be an unpopular opinion and I'd be downvoted into oblivion. \n\n\n\nOP good luck and thank you for taking care of those kiddos. I'm sure birth mom will give you guys trouble for the rest of her life, but here's to hoping she can get clean and at least be something positive for her children.",
