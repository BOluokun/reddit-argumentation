  "post content": "My mom was a great mother. I had a really good childhood, especially considering how young she was and that my dad is a piece of shit. I really appreciate how she shielded me from all of that. \n\nMy mom is married to my former boss, and while it sucks for me, I do believe she did her duty as a mother and deserves to be happy. I used to work for \"Brandon\". This was one of those jobs where networking was everything, you really needed the boss to like you, and you had to present a certain image. i will admit I tried way too hard and to put it lightly, Brandon did not like me. He was a condescending ass, and my mom was aware as I vented to her about work. He wasn't outright abusive, but did laugh at me a lot and make a few comments that weren't cool. \n\nMy mom and Brandon met at our wedding. Now I don't believe in love at first sight, but they definitely had something there, and my first instinct was eww, but they got serious really fast and I have to say he makes her really happy, and she has never seemed truly happy before. I hate being around him, wish this never happened, but I am happy for them. My wife thinks my mom is a bad mother for putting herself first.\n\nRecently my five year old son asked why we don't see my mom as much as my in laws (about once a month vs once or twice a week) My wife said that while my in laws were the best parents, my mom was a bad mom because she married Brandon who had not been nice to me, and we don't spend much time with her because she was selfish. \n\nI was furious and told my son that was not true. I said we don't spend time together because my mom has a busier life, and because MIL doesn't work so they sometimes go over during the day. I said that it was wrong of my wife to say that, and my mom was a great mom. \n\nMy wife told our son I was wrong and a good mom would not have married someone like that. I snapped and told my son not to listen to his mother, and she just doesn't like my mom. I said that women with adult kids should put themselves first and maybe it isn't healthy how much we see MIL, but my mom is a great person and I won't hear anything more about it.\n\nwhen my son went to play, my wife confronted me and said I undermined her and was acting like a mama's boy. she said I should not have raised my voice (didn't yell, but did raise it) and that I shouldn't be confusing our son when what my mom did was objectively not ok",

It's ok not to answer that question fully.  Kids have diarrhea of the mouth and there is no reason to use him as an excuse to \"accidentally\" have him spout off the next time he sees his grandmother. Exactly what's he supposed to call your tormenter you don't say.  You also haven't said whether or not your former boss now stepfather was man enough to own his behavior and apologize. Need a little more data.\n\nI disagree with you that an adult parent has carte blanche to pursue a relationship with someone that tormented you.  You did give a subtle nod of approval for this guy by inviting him to your wedding. I think you made the right decision to avoid them as much as possible and bear in mind the tormenter could care less he's hurting your mom's relationships.  \n\nYou don't mention whether or not your mom has come up for air long enough to realize your absence. If she has, my guess is instead of being honest that you don't want any kind of relationship with him you're saying how busy you are. \n\nWife needs to close her mouth regarding your Mom. The future is unknown and there's no reason to poison your son's thoughts.\n\nEdited to say since your SF clearly loathes you and your wife it's unhealthy to spend ANY time in his proximity.  SF hates being sucked up to but he went to your wedding. Tells you he has a sixth sense about golddiggers and your obsessed with your mom's money? He's toxic AF. If Mom is insistent on him being present any time you see her she's drank the Kool aid. If she'll come to your house without him then you two might be able to have more frequent visitation. Your stance of \"I'm glad Mom is happy\" is mature and isolates the both of you. Your approach would be healthier had she chosen someone that isn't toxic. Mom blaming you for sucking up too much is her deflecting that she chose a man over her established family.  No, I don't respect that.
