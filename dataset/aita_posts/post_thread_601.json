I'd like to preface that her and I are both neurodivergent; I have ADHD and she is autistic. We are also mainly an online relationship, but we've been going steady for almost a year and we've known each other for longer.\n\nI do not know when this really started, but it's something I struggle with, really, every day. I'll be messaging my girlfriend, us both focused on a topic or something we're both doing (that I potentially have to hold up my end of) and then I'll look over at something else. Maybe it's something I'm watching on TV, maybe it's a hole of browsing through Wikipedia, maybe it's checking Twitter. Whatever it is I get distracted with, I only intend to check it for a minute before getting to what I'm meant to do. But then I get lost in this thing, sometimes to the point of spacing out. One minute turns to ten turns to fifteen, and by then I panic and scramble back to message her.\n\nThere's also times when we have something going on, but for one reason or another I don't focus on it. I spend time focusing on chatting with her and seemingly ignoring the thing we're working on, I message a group chat we're both in... Either way, I unintentionally blow off things we're working on for stretches of time that I only meant to be for a few minutes or so. \n\nThere's more examples that I'll probably remember, but this is mainly what happens. Me stepping away from our conversation or things that we're working on because of a distraction that I... don't really want to be distracted by.\n\nThis has caused a lot of stress for my girlfriend. She has many commitments in her own life, be they taking care of her pets, going to college and dealing with that immense workload, and many many other things. And yet, she still makes time to talk to me, even when she hasn't got time for anything else she enjoys. You can imagine how upset it makes her to seem me always go silent or have my messages to her be punctuated by 10-15 minute gaps, gaps that I don't intend to create. \n\nI'm trying to work on this, but there always seem to be moments where it gets really bad and she reaches a breaking point. It's made me feel like such an a-hole for not nipping it in the bud immediately. Am I the asshole here?",

It's just fundamentally not the same as being in a face-to-face conversation. Fifteen minutes is not that long to wait for a text response in any circumstance, whether someone has ADHD or no. \n\nI'd say you need to agree on what is 'we are doing this together, online/on text, now' and commit to not looking at other stuff in that time. Maybe those sessions need to be on facetime or discord or zoom or something live so you don't get distracted from talking to her.\n\nIf you're just texting back and forth, it doesn't have to be immediate response, and you both need to agree that if it's that setting, 15 minutes isn't disrepecting or ignoring her.",

If you're really trying to improve the situation and not just telling yourself you're trying and then settling back into the same habits you're on the right track.\n\nThat being said, it sounds like you and your girlfriend need to sit down and have some communication about your communication. I'm a bit older than you, but if I need an immediate response to something I'm not sending it over text. Ten to fifteen minutes to respond to a text message doesn't seem to be out of the realm of reasonability.\n\nIt might be a good idea to start setting aside times where you talk on the phone or video chat where you're setting aside time specifically to spend time talking to each other in a situation where you're less likely to be distracted.  \n\n\nEDIT: NAH is contingent on the idea that her being upset is attributable to her autism and that she is also willing to work on things from her end.",

We live in a world of technology where seeing a reminder takes zero time. All it takes is to say \u201chey Siri, remind me in 3 minutes to text Jordan back.\u201d",
