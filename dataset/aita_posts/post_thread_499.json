  "post content": "A while back I was invited to my younger cousin's wedding out of state and I originally had RSVP'd about a year plus in advance.\n\nSince then, life happened and I was going through a bitter breakup myself and allot of personal problems. \n\nBy now the wedding is a couple of months out and I inform her that I will no longer be attending because I was in such a deep dark depression that I didn't want to ruin her special day with my problems.\n\nAm I the @$$hole, here?\n\nEdit 1: The bride is completely innocent in this story. She did nothing wrong. This is based on my guilt of the feeling of selfishness brought on by the depression.\n\nEdit 2: Myself an only child and my two younger cousins (the bride in the story and her older brother) practically grew up together as my aunt would frequently babysit us kids as both my parents worked.",

It's not selfish, hell I'd even say you are a very caring person for thinking the way you are. If you need time off, take it. But I would advice you to inform her as soon as you can so she can do the proper preparations. I'm sure your cousin would understand. And two months is more than enough time to prepare. \n\n\nTo everyone else. Guys, the bride hasn't done anything. She isn't the asshole here either.",
