  "post content": "I (32m, white) am potentially in trouble at work, but I don't really think I deserve it.\n\nMy coworker, \"Anna\" (23-ish f, asian), is new at our office and she brings her own lunch on days we don't have a food truck. On Thursday (yesterday), she brought in a homemade stir fry and used our shared microwave in the break room to do it. I was in the room when she took it out of the microwave, and it smelled heavenly. I asked her about the recipe and she told me it was just a bunch of ingredients and spices thrown together as to not waste any veggies that might go bad soon. \n\nWhen I was telling her how good it smelled, I also mentioned that some other people at the office might think it would be too smelly or ethnic (as in, racist people tend to look down on \"ethnic\" things). I have read those kind of stories on here about microagressions when it comes to people of color and the food they bring in, and I wanted to warn her that she might not want to bring it in anymore so it doesn't happen to her. I emphasized that it smelled good to me personally, though.\n\nI guess a couple of the other co-workers in the room overheard our conversation, because after Anna left the room, some of them sort of quietly told me how it was inappropriate for me to have said that. I told them that it's true, that ethnic food gets ridiculed for smelling too strong and that I disagreed with that senitment, but I also think she would face less harassment if she didn't bring in that food anymore. One of my other coworkers then said that \"I was the only one harassing her\" and making insinuations that her food is problematic, plus the fact that she hasn't even been bringing in her own food that often since she just started last week, so there couldn't have been an opportunity to have had this hypothetical harassment happen to her. I just wanted people, yes, even the assholes, at the office to make her feel welcomed.\n\nI left work that day not thinking anything of it, until the following morning where I hear from a different coworker that Anna talked to our HR department about the conversation and how she was \"hurt\". I'm a bit frustrated as to why she didn't talk to me about it first since it was just a misunderstanding and that I'm looking out for her. I did notice that today she was trying to dodge me, which is unusual and a bit heartbreaking. I just want to work things out. I wanted to be a friend to her and help her out since this is one of her first jobs out of undergrad, but this has been blown of out proportion. Now my coworkers think I'm racist, but I really try my best to be an ally, but then again what do I know?\n\nSo, am I the asshole for telling her that her food might be a bit too much for other potentitally racist people in the office to handle?\n\nEDIT: Some people have said to edit this post to add this: yes, I get it, I'm the asshole. What I said was really stupid. If it means anything to you guys, I remember entering the workforce as a young man shadowing assholes and I didn't know how to express how shitty I was treated since I thought it was normal to be treated a certain way or overhear certain things. I just thought she was a sweet girl who didn't deserve to see the nasty side of corporate life so quick, but I guess I ended up being like the guys that made my earlier career so god awful. \n\nAnyway I want to apologize to her in the most HR-friendly way this Tuesday. Hopefully she doesn't quit, but I also don't want to be the one that gets fired. Fingers crossed. Thank you for opening my eyes and I hope to do my due diligence to be a real ally.",

We had 3 black people in my school. 2 were wildly popular, the 3 had deformities and was poor so they were bullied because of that but not race \"facepalm\". \nI was raised to treat everyone the same, color didn't matter. \n\nThen I moved to the deep south for school. It was awful. \n\nThe hardest and most frustrating part of trying to over come racism is getting through to people that don't think they are racist. \n\nWhat I didn't see and had to learn was everything I knew and was taught never once took into the account of the experiences of others. It's one thing to say \"I'm not racists\" when the only experience I had was a couple people with darker skin than mine that grew up in the same place with the same experience.  Wr didn't see them as different because they weren't. Culturally we were exactly the same. So it's easy to be offended that anyone would treat them different because they were one of us. \n\nBoy did I get a badly needed education! \nI get it now....as much as a white girl from the sticks can anyways...I learned to shut my mouth and listen. I learned my opinion doesn't matter.  I'll say it again for the cheap seats in the back...my thoughts and feelings on racism didn't matter..it's not for me to say \"it's not racist because I see everyone the same\". No\n Just no. I am not the gauge of what racism is. Those who are the ones feeling the hurt of it are the ones to decide if it's racist or not. \n\nThere is such an attitude of \"I'm not racist so anyone who says otherwise is just being dramatic and making a big deal out of nothing and need to get over it\" and I have found that us the hardest and most infuriating attitude to break. It totally discounts the experience of others and that is racism at its core. \"Everyone should think like me\"  uhg. \n\nAnyone who wants to be an ally needs to constantly check their own ideas/thought/behavior and be ready and willing to evolve and follow the lead of someone who knows first had. If someone gets upset, like Anna going to HR and the coworkers...the true allies...then clearly there is a problem and guess what op? It's you!",
