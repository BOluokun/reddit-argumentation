  "post content": "I'm very new , so excuse any mistakes.\n\nTomorrow is my eldest daughter's 19th birthday.\n\nShe's only ever wanted one thing for her birthday: concert tickets to see her favorite band, which is a korean band called BTS. I know she's been a big fan of theirs for a few years and has wanted to see them live for a long time. I kind of got sucked into the group a little myself, through our mother-daughter bonding time and decided that I would buy as tickets for her birthday.\n\nNow the twist was, that I had to give her her present beforehand, because the concert was going to be ON her birthday (so tomorrow).\n\nGetting the tickets was really hard and they weren't the best admittedly but when I gave them to her a few months ago, she was in tears and I've honestly never felt so happy seeing how happy the tickets made her. She was so elated, was dancing and singing and just so happy that I definitely knew I had made the right decision.\n\nNow as you can probably tell from the timing, it didn't work out. The concert got cancelled and my daughter was and still is completely devastated. She's been crying the entire weekend on and off and was inconsolable. I made it a point to sit down with her, have a talk, try to cheer her up and re-watch some of their DVDs with her but it only made her sadder.\n\nThis morning, her father and my ex-partner came by to bring some birthday presents and talk about our daughters birthday \"party\" - since we won't be traveling to the concert, we decided to have just a small gathering in the park, just my partner, my ex, I, the siblings and a few of my daughter's friends eating cake at a safe distance.\n\nHer father was apparently put off with how sad and dejected my daughter looked and asked her if she wasn't excited for her birthday. She just said not really and when he wanted to know why, she said she was sad about the concert being cancelled. He got mad and started mocking her about how priviledged she was, that she was too old to bis this hung up over a boyband and that she couldn't enjoy what everyone else was doing for her because she's so selfish etc.\n\nI blew up at him, threw him out and told him not to bother coming tomorrow. My family is telling me I overreacted and even my daughter tells me she wants her dad there but I told her he could come only if he apologized to her before that.\n\nSeemingly everyone thinks this is not a huge deal but I won't allow my ex to talk to his daughter like that, even if she permits it.\n\nAITA here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I thought I'd update since the \"party\" is starting soon. I was pretty upset all day yesterday about the situation but I ended up telling my daughter the decision was up to her. She decided he could come but thankfully insisted on an apology herself, which she has never done before and I'm incredibly proud of her for sticking up for herself. I talked to my ex-partner after they were done talking and apologized for my outburst but also told him that the way he treated our daughter and her hobbies needed to stop. I could tell he wasn't happy but did agree to either just accept or not comment on things that make her happy.\n\nJust as a last comment to some of the people who commented disparaging things about my daughter and her hobby: I don't appreciate it and I feel sad that some of you have apparently never had something you were truly passionate about. And for context: my daughter told me that the group is apparently going to disband soon because they have to go to the military so this might have been her only chance. ",

So I understand what you are doing by uninviting him, but please let your daughter make this decision for herself. \n\nPersonally I have a distant and melancholy relationship with my father that I am working out internally and the little interaction that I have brings me a little bit of comfort even though it can bring up negative feelings. It is possible that, like me, she hasn't sorted out her feelings or is focused on something bigger than the drama and guilt that would come with rejecting her father. Sometimes, in my case, younger people are resilient to these remarks and understand \"this is dad's problem, not who I am.\" Alternatively it may make her life harder if he's uninvited because family guilt is one hell of a thing to go through. You did right by kicking him out of your house, but if she says she wants her father there for a important day in HER life you should respect that. Listen to her about her feelings about him, be sad WITH her, be angry WITH her but ultimately this relationship is her choice and she should be trusted to navigate it how she thinks is best.",

They broke up when we were 16 before we got the chance to see them live.\n\nLast December, guess what - they\u2019re back touring and we got tickets! This week, the show got cancelled. It absolutely sucks. I\u2019ve been waiting for to see them live for NINE years. I\u2019m gutted. But there\u2019s a global pandemic. \n\nI do understand how your daughter feels, honestly. It\u2019s shit - and I\u2019m not defending what your ex said. Of course she\u2019s going to be sad. But she needs to learn to cope with her emotions. Frankly? If a concert being cancelled is the worst that happens to you right now, count yourself lucky. Sobbing over it for multiple days is an overreaction. Your daughter could\u2019ve guessed it would be cancelled and has had plenty of time to come to terms with it.",

The fact that she\u2019s inconsolable for days though is troubling for a 19 year old. Does she always have this inability to regulate her emotions or self soothe? If so, she might need some outside intervention like a therapist to teach her age appropriate coping techniques. My sisters wedding was cancelled this coming weekend....it\u2019s a sucky time for people- but she is adult enough to know that it will happen down the line when the world isn\u2019t in chaos...\n\nYes- her dad might have been harsh with her- but if your daughter is upset about that she needs to ask for an apology and have a talk with him herself. That\u2019s not your place. Again, if your daughter is having a hard time expressing her feelings about that- maybe seeing a professional would be a good idea for her. \n\nIt sounds like dad was being too harsh and you are perpetuating her immaturity.",
