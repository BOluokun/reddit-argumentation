  "post content": "I (24) got pregnant while I was taking a gap year traveling. I met an older guy, nothing gross, I was 19 he was 23. We had fun. I was working in a bar to make money while I explored his city. \n\nWhen I got pregnant he lost interest really quickly. I understood but I am pro choice. And I chose not to terminate. \n\nI went home and had my son. I also made sure to get child support. He could afford it. He did fight it though. I had to prove paternity and everything. \n\nThrough that his parents found out. They are well off. They have met my son and they truly do seem to love him. They have provided gifts for his birthday and Christmas. They helped me with extra money so I could complete my university without going into debt. They have taken us on vacation with them so they could spend time with him. They aren't my biggest fans but we are cordial to each other. \n\nThree months ago my son's father passed away. He got drunk at his bachelor party, tripped on the sidewalk, and hit his head. And that was all she wrote. \n\nMy son and I attended the funeral. We spent a week in that city so his grandparents could see him. \n\nThey approached me with an offer. They had no other children or grandchildren. Their son was only 28 so he had lots of time to provide them legitimate kids (they did not say this I'm just assuming) so they never thought about my son's name. \n\nThey said that if I changed his surname to theirs legally they would make him their primary heir. I think this is dumb. He is their only grandchild and they would deny him an inheritance because of his last name? \n\nI said I would consider it, to be polite, and have left it at that. I actually have a pretty good life as it is. My family has been very supportive. And because of the whole court thing my son's father had to have life insurance with him as the beneficiary. \n\nWould it be nice for my kid to get a big sum of money. Yes. Do I want him to have the surname of a man who didn't want him, see him, or love him? No. \n\nI have been talking to my family about it and a few of them think I'm being an asshole for giving up.this kind of money for my son. It is generational wealth and I'm making the decision based on emotion. I think they are assholes for thinking money is the only thing that matters. \n\nI think I will tell my son's grandparents that they can talk to him about it when he is 16. He will be old enough to understand the implications but young enough not to be tied professionally to his last name.",

The grandparents have really stepped up already, but people are saying they never loved OP and their grandchild if they're asking for a name change.\n\nEven if he was an asshole, these people lost their son 3 months ago. It's obvious their hearts aren't made of stone, so of course they're grieving him. I can't imagine that kind of pain and devastation. \n\nRight now, their words are tied to their grief. I don't think they should instantly be viewed as horrible because of it. It's also likely that their wealth being generational comes into play.\n\nAccidents happen, and there's no guarantee the grandparents will live until the child is old enough to make his own decision. I think OP could ask if they'd be okay with a hyphenated name, or make his current last name his middle name.",

Dangling generational wealth above ones head is kind of coercive or a form of emotional/financial blackmailing. They put the mother in the position to 'sell' his lastname or to be the person to deny him big money. But in reality **they** are TA for making such demands and conditions. I'd be extremely wary what this might lead to in the future.

No one here, even the ones firmly on the side of changing the name, are arguing for naming traditions and name based legacies. But the grandparents are. It is clearly their motivation. I work with the elderly, and depending on the generation of the grandparents, it's not unheard of to have weird and illogical feelings about your family name dying off. \n\nAlso, the man is dead. While it is objectively true that he wanted nothing to do with his son for 5 years, It won't change the son's curiosity and connection he has to his birth father through his grandparents. Their love and family and money are good enough to take free vacations on, why deny their grandson a close relationship to them by harping on the now dead father being a deadbeat?\n\nA hyphenated last name solves most of the logistical problems you are wholey imagining or keeping his original surname as his middle name. Of my 4 single parent friends, only 1 woman shares the same last name as their children, and no one denies them at the airport or school pickup, if that's the type of thing you mean.\n\nI know of a case at my job a long time ago, a rich couple had only daughters (I was the widowed dad's nurse in end stage dementia) and both daughters had kept their maiden name. Where it gets weird is I noticed that all the grandkids, and most of the great grandkids, also had the family name (their respective Mom's maiden name.) One day I was casually chatting to one son in law and I just asked him about it.\n\nHe laughed and said we weren't the first team of nurses to notice. You guessed it, these were men from middle class or poor backgrounds, and my client had been a legacy obsessed lunatic who dangled huge amounts of money in his daughters' faces to keep their names AND name their children that so he wouldn't end the family legacy. Is it crazy and wrong? Probably. But the SonIL kept laughing and told me that for the amount of money this family had, he would have named his first born Bozo the clown maiden name, and his BIL felt the same. And he reassured me they had been great in laws and phenomenal grandparents, but because of being the only ones from his large family to survive WW2, the name was an obvious sore spot before the girls' marriages even happened. \n\nSometimes, maturity is looking at the bigger picture and not just what is moral or technically correct. A lot of people starve alone in perfect morality and having done everything right. \n\nWhile I appreciate your point, it's more nuanced than \"teaching them a lesson in what family really means.\"\n\nStill, OP. it is technically your choice. NAH.\n\nBut when your son finds out at 18, you'll likely be made the asshole if you resist at least adding their last name and compromising with them maturely. Good luck, OP.",

If they\u2019re willing to leave it to him at all, it shouldn\u2019t be based on such weird conditions which immediately tells you it isn\u2019t about love or kindness. Not to mention, the fact this is only coming up now suggests they didn\u2019t really care before realising he was going to be their only \u2018heir\u2019 - they were absolutely counting on other grandchildren to come along. Suggest the 16 years of age thing and also consider if you\u2019d be happy with your son having a double barrelled name with theirs. \n\nPeople are accusing you of putting pride and ego above practicality (money) but they are putting pride and ego above family. Money isn\u2019t everything. If you think you and your own family are comfortable enough that your son will not struggle then imo you\u2019re all good. You don\u2019t need family with strings. If you bend on this, who knows how many other things they are going to push you on \u201cfor the good of your son\u201d in the future. \n\nSome people on this post seem to think a surname is meaningless but I disagree and I think particularly for women to share their name with their kids it can be a very significant feeling. Lots are saying your son will never forgive you. If I were your child, as someone who did not grow up with money at all, I would still rather have the name than the money.",

The Y T A responses are seeing dollar signs and not seeing how the grandparents are asking for something (a name change) by holding money over OP's head. That is financial control and it is generally a bad idea to let someone control you with money.\n\nThe grandparents should be recognizing their grandchild anyway. In any traditional family, you don't have the same name as two of your four grandparents and they would be assholes to deny you inheritance because you are a child of their daughter and don't have their surname. People aren't entitled to have their name pass on anyway - they can have all daughters and therefore traditionally the surname would not pass on. And what, are people saying they have the right to demand one of those grandkids to change their name or they'd be disinherited? That is ridiculous. The grandparents are asking this because it's their deadbeat son's child, and they are making a rather sexist assumption that they are entitled to have the kid take the surname of the male line. \n\nAnd further, the kid's actual father isn't involved in their life, OP is the single parent, so of course the kid will have OP's name. \n\nI say if the grandparents want to pull this maybe they need to learn that OP is the only legal guardian of OP's kid and their relationship is happening with OP's consent. And they're basically threatening to disinherit the child if OP doesn't do what they want. That'd be an interesting case if OP cuts them off: \"we want grandparents' rights after blackmailing OP and refusing to put the child in question in our will\".",
