  "post content": "My wife didn't like her job. I was telling her to look for a job while she was still in her current company. She wanted to take a break from work but we cannot afford it right now due to our accidental conception. She's 3 months pregnant. \n\nSo I made her a resume and applied her for a few interviews. However, she didn't attend any of them saying she doesn't feel like it. She said she wants to be a SAHM. I told her we weren't even planning this pregnancy and now we cannot afford for her to become unemployed as well. \nShe didn't listen and just quit her job without consulting with me. I was super mad at her. I told her I don't want to bust my ass while she relaxes at home. She cried and said that she doesn't want to work anymore. So I told her I'd be quitting my job as well and then we can both stay jobless and homeless with our child. \n\nI pretended to quit the job in front of her by sending an angry mail to \"my boss\" but instead sent it to my friend. \nShe was shocked and asked me why I'd do such a thing. I told her tough luck and went to sleep. The next morning onwards, she got ready for an interview and started attending interviews. I called my work and took a break of 1 week. \n\nToday, my wife got a job and she gave me the news at night while we were having dinner. I then told her the truth about my not quitting the job and about it being a way to make her go back to work. \n\nShe got mad at me and told me I was very petty and I should've just sucked it up and let her stay at home. Now she's not talking to me. \n\nAITA?",

Im currently on maternity leave. However I can safely say being a mother isn\u2019t \u201crelaxing at home\u201d. It\u2019s feeding and changing your baby. Recovering while also nourishing. It\u2019s playing the game of \u201cdo i get a nap myself or take a shower after not having one for three days\u201d. It\u2019s worrying about them but trying to not go insane. It\u2019s waking up every 2-3 hours to feed your child. It\u2019s also keeping up on the house, specifically laundry and cooking. Cleaning when you can. Eating meals separately because the baby woke up and needs one of you.\n\nYou clearly have no idea what your about to get into and I pray for that child\u2026and im not even religious. But yeah being a stay at home parent isn\u2019t a vacation from chores and responsibility. Good luck. Also got look into how much child care is gonna cost, is the cost of her working even gonna bring much in once you account for that?",

That will leave you with being the sole income and doing all the household chores. What will you do then? I was put on bed rest at 3 months until I delivered, with strict instructions to not get up for more than 5 mins at a time or risk a miscarriage. We went from a household that could barely make it on two incomes to me being sent from my doctors appointment straight to the hospital and then bed rest. Single income with a high risk pregnancy. I had to quit my job that day because I couldn\u2019t return and I couldn\u2019t get up to do chores either. My child was in the NICU for awhile and I couldn\u2019t work then either.

Like, ok how many times can you sit someone down, show them the budget, and explain why this won't work at all, before it becomes clear that you can't communicate facts to someone that doesn't want to hear them? how do you communicate more clearly than stating facts and pointing out your respective roles in the successful management of the household? she doesn't *want* to work anymore, and just wants OP to \"figure it out\".
