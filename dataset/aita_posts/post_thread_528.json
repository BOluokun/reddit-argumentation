Maybe your friend seems you too needy or is generally ready to move on. It really hurts but it can save you alot of grief to see where your friends head is. You may not get closure, especially if they just blow you off. If she does that, then you have your answer. Move on. You will grieve the friendship but its better than allowing yourself to wonder forever if you could have fixed it. Start investing in other friendships and activities. Gravitate toward what makes you happy to feel this void.",

I don\u2019t think you need to do a dramatic confrontation or anything. But maybe if you keep yourself busy, she will want to hang out occasionally still, and you won\u2019t feel like you are being ignored. Friendships sometimes go through periods of being close and being not so close. It can be normal. She may also just be maturing into a kind of mean person, so watch out for that.",
