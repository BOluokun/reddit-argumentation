  "post content": "My husband, our daughters (18, 16, 16, 12), and I live in a 4 bed 2 bath house. \n\nAll of the girls share a bathroom and they\u2019ve been complaining about it for a while. We\u2019ve been saying we\u2019ll convert the laundry room into a bathroom for the twins for a while. It\u2019s an expensive project so we\u2019ve never gotten to it. \n\nMy husband and I started working on our garage recently and turned it into a gym for him, a new laundry room, and an office for me. Then we came into some money and decided to renovate both bathrooms, remodel the kitchen, and do work on the backyard. \n\nThe girls were pissed when we told them about the work we were doing on the house. They were saying it\u2019s not fair that my husband gets a gym when the twins share a room and that we chose to work on the backyard instead of adding the third bathroom. \n\nThey\u2019ve been calling us selfish and even got our parents and siblings to give us a hard time for not giving the girls another bathroom or giving the twins their own rooms. They don\u2019t understand that now that the laundry room is done we have the space for the bathroom. The bathroom is next on our list. \n\nI wanted to get some outside opinions on this since our kids and our families have been giving us a hard time.",

YTA for springing for a luxury instead of choosing to make life easier for your kids.\n\nEditing because I keep getting the same comment over and over of people saying something along the lines of \"HOW DARE YOU! I live in a house of 6/9/12 and we share 1/2/a fraction of a bathroom! You are spoiled and icky!\", and I'm really tired of penning the same response over and over, so I'll just say here:\n\n1. I grew up the youngest of five. I shared a bathroom for eighteen years with siblings.\n2. I share an apartment with a few folks, and we share one bathroom.\n3. My point is that, if I had a bunch of money lying around, I'd spend it to make the lives of my kids a bit easier, rather than on something frivolous.\n4. For all of you crying out \"ENTITLEMENT AND LUXURY! UGH!\" Please take the time, whilst you redden your faces in rage at the prospect of two people sharing a bathroom instead of four, to also take your energy to defend OP's choice to redo the existing bathrooms, redo her kitchen, add a new gym, and redesign her backyard.\n5. You all like to skate over the fact that OP lied to her kids about a new bathroom, and has presumably been doing so for a while.\n\nHopefully that hits anything that anybody else who wants to hop on and complain into the internet void could possibly care about.\n\nEdit 2: Jesus Christ y'all, everyone here has probably had to share a bathroom. You are adding NOTHING to the discussion by spamming this thread with \"Me! Me! Me! I grew up sharing a bathroom and was fine!\" That's great but.... once again.... NOT THE POINT. YOU ARE SOMEHOW ENTIRELY MISSING THE POINT. \n\nThe new trend is for folks to say \"well, the older kids are gonna be gone soon, so it doesn't matter!\". No, they're not. OP has commented that the kids aren't gonna be moving out until at least after they're done with college. \n\nAaaaaaand finally, for you sexxxxxy edgelords who are commenting calling me and others dumb or derogatory things, I sincerely have to ask: what do you wish to accomplish? What special contribution do you think you're making to the internet? Do you think a nice, spicy \"fuck you\" is gonna change the mind of myself and others on here? All you're doing is making me chuckle at the fact that you're sitting with your phone or computer puffing in anger over something that, in abstract, doesn't effect you at all. I'm not gonna answer you, so you're wasting the precious energy of the joints of your phalanges. But do you :)",

This isn't about entitlement. This is about the parents not doing what they said they would.  If the additional bathroom was never going to be their top priority, then they should've been straightforward with their kids. \n\nAlso, I DO own a home and have a $4k/mo mortgage so I understand how much work goes into it.  I watched my parents work their way up from the floor and am very well aware of the value of hardwork.  I just spent $15k to add a full bathroom to my basement.  I also have never lived in a house with more than one bathroom until very recently, including a good part of my childhood living in an apartment with 8 people and only 1 bathroom.  My parents were honest and realistic with me and wouldn't tell me that they were going to do something for me if it wasn't something they were actually going to do.  \n\nThe parents had two simple options: 1) tell them they were going to add a bathroom for them and then DO IT, or 2) don't tell them they are going to add a bathroom and then not add one. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

If you need to be on the bus at 6:30, wake up at 6 and then the bathroom is taken up, it was your fault if you were late since you weren't up early enough. My parents also had to be at work for 7, so they had priority for the \"later\" times for the bathroom. It was on us to get up earlier to get ready, and we wouldn't take morning showers, we'd stagger them at night mostly. Granted only 4 of us were ever teenagers and home at a time, the little ones had later school so it wasn't as bad.",
