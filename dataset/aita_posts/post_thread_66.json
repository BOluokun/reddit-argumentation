  "post content": " My husband and I began looking at getting away from the city a few years ago. We had a small checklist: husband wanted permanent running water, I wanted a house. We looked at many properties before we stumbled across this one by a fluke. It has two permanent creeks and a small house and is absolutely perfect. The property runs adjacent to a national park so it will always remain secluded. We both instantly fell in love and even though it was quite out of our budget, our parents both loved it as well and helped us purchase it. The property itself is almost 100 acres and is the very last house on the dirt road. (Also, I should mention that the seller of the property was an elderly man who only used this place as a weekender and owned his permanent home in the city)\n\nOne of the main things that drew us to this place is the permanent creeks. They are full of swimming holes and one of the best ones even had a rope tied to the tree. Real estate agents said that a few local kids had used it because previous owner was never there and didn\u2019t mind. \n\nThe road turns into an easement to get to the national park entrance and the creek line is the boundary of our property to the national park. The swimming hole in question is about midway between the easement and our house. Over the years, this swimming hole has become well known to the locals and there is a path that has been made to get to this swimming hole that is on our property.  \n\nWe certainly didn\u2019t like the idea of strangers walking so near the house so Husband puts up a wire fence across the path and a no trespassing sign. Within days of putting it up, a woman walks around the fence and to our house to yell at us saying that she has been walking this path and swimming for 30 years. We politely tell her that it is private property and just because the old owners didn\u2019t mind doesn\u2019t mean we do as well. Less than a week after this incident, somebody posts about the fence in our local suburb Facebook group and while many people were angry, many understood as well. We\u2019re not asking people to not swim. We don\u2019t own the water, we\u2019re just asking people to go to the national park side to access the swimming hole (because we DO own right up to the waters edge). However, about another week later, our sign is stolen and the wire fence is cut. We have made it very clear what our reasoning is. We purchased this property for privacy and so far, people are more invasive than if we had purchased in the city. Just today, I was out mowing (we haven\u2019t replaced the sign or fence yet) and 3 girls come walking from this path and walk directly across the front paddock, essentially our front yard. Am I the A-hole for wanting to protect my privacy? \n\nTldr; The access to a really awesome swimming hole, that has been used for generations, is on our property and we don\u2019t want people trespassing to get to it.\n\nEdit: I tried to sketch the layout. Sorry it\u2019s not great \n[bad sketch](https://imgur.com/gallery/x1vaKkL) \n\nDidn\u2019t really want to say this but I am 26F and my husband works away for 2 weeks at a time. And there is no phone reception at all. Safety is a valid concern. We haven\u2019t sought any legal advice and I doubt we will. We\u2019ll try a few more peaceful resolves (signs, clearing a new path on the other side and planting plants on our on path) and if nothing works then that\u2019s it. They win. It\u2019s not a war I\u2019m willing to wage because I do actually want to continue living here.",

And depending on where they are, that entitlement might be justified. There's actually a big lawsuit going on in my area about a very similar issue, a ranch used to provide informal access to public land and allow camping in certain privately owned pastures for generations, then it was sold to new owners who cut off that access. It's a class-action suit filed against the landowners by a mix of recreational groups and private citizens, and they've got a good enough claim that one of the best real estate attorneys in the state took it and it made it past all the preliminary hearings and is supposed to go to trial in a few months.\n\nI sympathize with both sides, honestly.

That was actually a much more interesting case than what you're describing and has to do with a lot more than just access easements.\n\nBasically in California, anything between the mean high tide line and the surf is public property and can be accessed by the public. Furthermore, if there's a beach and the only way to get there from the public right of way is through your private property, you're required to provide an easement across your property to access that beach.\n\nBut in the case of Martin's Beach, the deed to the land, including the beach itself, predates California as a US state. There is a continuous path of private ownership dating back to the Spanish Alta California days. And what the property owner (co-founder of Sun Microsystems, billionaire and Disney villain Vinod Khosla) was arguing was that the State of California had no legal authority to nullify the ownership of the beach from that prior contract. And as a result that he should not have been required to provide an easement, as the beach itself was not public property.\n\nThankfully he lost.",

When it comes to city-life, it's perfectly reasonable to hunker down in your own flat or suburban house and protect your own interests to the fullest, if that's the kind of relationship to the wider community you're okay with. Rural life however has always been coming with a greater reliance on your neighbourhood, historically out of necessity and today often as a way of life. It's a give and take for the common good of the community, where the balancing towards everyones private interests of privacy and property has been settled through established practices and customs over the years. A well established path more than a football field away from your house is not an unreasonable expectation from the others in the given circumstances. Yet if you really feel it's a big no-no, consider reaching out to the your neighbours about organising the clearing of a good alternative path to the swimming hole. (if they don't wanna chip in, well, then their original claim is obviously less legitimate.)  \n\n\nMoving in as an outsider does come with a social and moral obligation to show some considerations for all of this, in a humble fashion. You should, obviously, over the time have a good say in what you're comfortable with in regards to your own property and your land but you can't disregard what others have built togheter in terms of community and established practices without being an asshole. It's not that different from how gentrification breaks up former urban-based communities. Although one might be perfectly fine within their legal rights to sweep in and change up everyones living condition in an area, consider their way of life might be one of the direct or indirect reasons to why the place was attractive to move into to begin with. If you can't comply with reasonable and established community expectations, don't buy up land which will significantly affect their settled way of living.",
