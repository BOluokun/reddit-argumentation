  "post content": "So, my daughter was born over 3 months early. She's doing ok but she still have periods where she Bradly desats (braddies) where she stops breathing, oxygen saturation drops in her body and goes bright blue. She does this at least once a day and because of this, she is still in the NICU with no current projection for when she's coming home. The only thing I can do to help her is to give her cuddles and provide her milk, which means expressing for 20 minutes minimum on each boob every 2 to 3 hours, including over night. \n\nI have also had problems with flees in my home (they've been awful for everyone in my area this year), so I've torn up all carpets and thrown away my sofa and mattress, so I'm currently sleeping on the floor on a blow up mattress with my fianc\u00e9. This means that any noise that I make, no matter how much I try to minimise it, carries downstairs to my neighbour.\n\nI express milk over night, once at 11:30pm, 1am and then at 6:30am. My neighbour downstairs knocked on my door this morning and complained about my 1am alarm waking him up. I apologised and told him that I can't turn that specific alarm off because it's the expression that impacts my milk flow and doing that expression will prompt me to produce more milk over the day. I'm already under enough stress that my milk flow has already been impacted ( I was producing around 100ml and I'm down to 50 to 70 ml). I need the alarms because I cannot miss my expressions, I already feel guilty enough that I'm not producing as much as I was.\n\n I explained all this to him and he still said that it wakes him up and that he can't sleep after it wakes him up. I again apologised and said to him that I can set my alarm between 1am and 3:30am, and he can choose from between those times. He said I should just turn the alarm off and I responded that I can't, because I can't afford to sleep through my expressions times. He then said that I should express after 5am, which isn't possible because the hormones that help produce more milk are at their peak at between 1am and 4am. \n\nHe complained about it waking him up again and I angrily responded that \"My daughter is premature, she needs my milk and I will do everything to make sure she's got as much as she needs, including waking you up at 1am because I need to express!  She is my priority, not your sleep.\" I closed the door in his face. \n\nI just spoke to one of my friends and she's telling me that I'm the asshole because my daughter is eating every 3 hours and I'm making just enough milk every time for at least one meal for her, so \"it won't hurt to not express the 1am expression\" but it honestly IS the most important expression for milk production.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not stopping expressing at 1am even though I know it wakes up my neighbour?\n\nETA: many people have suggested I put the phone on vibrate, which would be a fantastic solution if it wasn't for the fact that I have slept straight through having injections or having a cannula put in (I was awoken long enough to give permission to have it put in). I'm open to solutions, but putting my phone on vibrate isn't going to work.\n\nEta2: I gave him noise cancelling earplugs and explained the situation when I first came home from the hospital. We also pulled up the carpets 4 days before I went into labour, so it's not something that we could control, we have to leave the flea solution to work for 2 weeks and the firm has already been booked to have new flooring put in after that 2 weeks.\n\nEta3: I've been asked to add this because it gives context to my neighbour's view regarding noise.\n\"He apparently needs absolute silence, noise or vibration doesn't seem to matter. He made a noise complaint when I moved in because I flushed my toilet at night and then again when my cat jumped down from her cat tree to get food or water at night. I've learned every squeaky floorboard in my home because if I stand on one and the squeak wakes him up, he'll scream and bang on the ceiling.\"\n\nThis will be my last edit, I am no longer going to be reading comments here or via pm as there has been some pretty heinous messages sent to me. I get it Reddit I'm the asshole but to have people tell me my daughter should stop breathing and die is unacceptable and I have reported that specific message and blocked the user. This is quite enough internet for a while.",

On top of that he would have his daughter over on weekends and she would run back and forth all day against my wall until about 11 pm every night (after 11pm he would have enough and tell her bed time so the screaming and crying would last until 12 am). Sometimes I would go back to sleep, sometimes with the help of a joint in the middle of the night, or sometimes I would not sleep at all. \n\nI did not sleep without interruptions for a year, and the month after he moved out I started to realize my skin was more rosy, my eyes less sunken in, I had more energy at work, I didn't have the need to smoke as much weed, I was eating better.\n\nInterrupted sleep is a silent killer, which nobody seems to know.

This isn't coming through the walls, it's through the floor. And it's not just 'able to hear it clearly'. It's 'loud enough to wake him up'. It doesn't matter if it only goes off for a few seconds.

My mom could sleep like a rock most of the time, but if my sister was up just rolling around in her crib, that would wake her up. For clarity, my sister was born when I was 10, and our rooms shared a wall. My mom was further down the hall with the stairwell separating her from my sister's room. I have clear memories of being woken when my mom went in to see my sister, who wasn't crying or making a bunch of noise because that would have woken me (shared wall) but my mom heard her anyway. I think of it as \"parent ears\"",

She tried the vibrating alarm (which I use), but it doesn't work for her. He's living in a place with shared walls, so he can't control when other people need to come and go, when they need to wake up for work, or use the bathroom. If he can't handle living where he has to hear other people at night, then that's something that he will have to figure out. \n\nHer baby is her priority and she's doing what she was probably told to. His sleep is his priority and his problem to figure out. The carpet will be back soon, so the supposed magic noise cancelation that is going to help him sleep like a fairytale princess through the night will be back in place. Everyone is rightfully worried about his sleep deprivation, but his inability to go back to sleep is really not something she needs to dance around either. OP is also losing sleep, and she tried to give him a heads up and headphones to cancel the noise. That's 1000% more consideration than I would have given my neighbors if I was going through the same thing as OP. They wouldn't even be on my radar. I've lived with noisy neighbors in the past; I wouldn't even consider her nighttime routine a minor distrubance comparatively. \n\nI also can't get over the fact that he is trying to dictate her lactation. That conversation would have ended before it began if it were me.",
