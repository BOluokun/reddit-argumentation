  "post content": "I (38F) just got married to (45M) Jim. He has two children with his ex-wife, twin girls 15 years old who live 5 hours away. I have no children. I have a great job, I have a rental property, & I have two other side hustles that adds to my income. Jim works full time but doesn\u2019t make as much as me. He takes care of the kids & the mortgage. I take care of all bills, car notes/insurance, & major purchases. I have plenty left over to spoil myself & Jim. His relationship with the girls is great, & my relationship is pretty good. We get them for a weekend every month & most breaks. We also try our best to attend extracurricular events.\n\nJim pays child support half of extracurriculars & health insurance costs, but also gives allowance, purchases most of the girls\u2019 clothing, pays for their hair to get done, & more. Their mother does not think it is enough & constantly berates him. She says she barely makes ends meet. I believe her, she is on disability for her asthma, & refuses to work. She has two degrees but says that because she has not worked in 16 years she won\u2019t now.\n\nLately she has been commenting on my lifestyle. She tells Jim that I should help more financially with the girls. He lets her know that the girls aren\u2019t my responsibility finically & that I support them in other ways. He lets me know that he is fine with me doing the extras for the girls (gifts, vacations, nails & such when they are with us).\n\nFor xmas she wants to do as they \u201calways have\u201d where Jim provides $1000 & she buys xmas gifts \u201cfrom mom & dad\u201d. I let Jim know that this was not ok now that we are married & a family. We can take the $1000 & buy the girls gifts from him & I. He is on the fence & does not think she will have money to buy the girls gifts. I think it is not our problem. Note: the girls will be with us on Christmas\n\nAlso, their birthday is coming up & they are turning 16. Jim wants to buy them a car & put it in our name & on our insurance. I think it is a bad idea because there are 2 other adults in the mom\u2019s home that don\u2019t work /don\u2019t have a car. I think they will bully the girls into \u201cborrowing\u201d the car & it will be more of a communal car. I don\u2019t want Jim & I to be responsible for anything happening if anyone other than the girls drive it. Jim understands & shares my concerns. My compromise is if we could go half on a cash car & their mother pays the other half, put the car in her name & on her insurance. He does not think their mother will be able to come up with the money & he feels bad because if we don\u2019t buy the car, they won\u2019t get one.\n\nI am starting to think that I may the a-hole because I don\u2019t help financially with the girls needs only their wants when they are with us, & I keep saying no to Jim.\n\nAITA because I don\u2019t want Jim to give his ex-wife money for xmas gifts from \u201cMom & Dad\u201d Also, AITA because I don\u2019t think it is a good idea to buy the girls a car in which I would have to help pay for.\n\nUpdate:\n\nA lot of people are asking if I have a prenup, yes I do.  We are keeping finances separate at least until after the girls turn 18 and child support obligations are over.\n\nWe have talked about getting custody of the girls. They don\u2019t particularly care for their home life but they don\u2019t want to leave their friends, school and activities to \u201cstart over\u201d here when they only have two years of school left. They know that they are more than welcome here at anytime.\n\nChristmas money. A lot of people think I have an issue with the amount of money. I absolutely do not. I have a problem with Jim facilitating Xmas in another household.  And then Jim and/or I will still need to facilitate a Xmas here in our household as we will have the girls. I like the idea of the send $500 to their mom and keep $500 to get gifts from us.\n\nThose that say I should just let it be because this is the way it\u2019s been done. Well I usually go on a solo Christmas trip. Should I pack up and go on my trip, because it\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been done or should I change things because I have a new family?\n\nI am not trying to bash their mother. She does have really bad asthma. But she also refuses to work in any way shape or form to make sure her children have what they need. She truly thinks it is Jim\u2019s responsibility to take care of her household. I don\u2019t know and really don\u2019t care what she is going to do after the child support payments stop in two years. \n\nThe car, I\u2019ve pretty much told him that the car is a bad idea. Jim and I talked it over last night and settled on that if their mother isn\u2019t willing to insure the car then we would wait until they are 18 before getting them the car. ",

It's not like this is a tradition passed down through the generations, this was something Jim did so his ex-wife could save face to the kids, and he is more generous than I would have been about it.\n\nThose saying \"it's Jim's 1k, you don't have a dog in this fight if finances are separate\" don't make sense to me. OP pays a vast majority of the money in the household. Jim wouldn't have that 1k to give to baby mama if OP wasn't funding their life in majority. If they split everything 50/50, he wouldn't have that money to give, so yes, OP is paying for it.\n\nIt's like living with your parents and not giving them money for household expenses but then turning around and buying an expensive car. You wouldn't have that money to spend if it wasn't for the grace and kindness of others.",

It sounds like she could work, but prefers to milk what she can get.\nEDIT:  I wasn't trying to claim she doesn't have bad asthma.  However, with her education, I would think she is capable of some job that would not be physically strenuous and could be worked from home.\n\nI also see where buying the kids a car is likely to open up a whole can of worms.  The Christmas gift thing is tougher, but I could see room to split the largesse where $500 goes the traditional route and $500 goes the new route.  \n\nIs there a chance your husband could get full custody instead?  What would the kids prefer?\nEDIT:  I understand the kids not wanting to relocate schools so close to graduation.",

It is possible to keep the car in Jim's name only, have the girls covered on Jim's car insurance and specifically exclude all other drivers in the household the girls stay in while they are with their mother.  There could possibly be technology (biometrics) which would exclude others besides the girls from driving the vehicle.  It is worth exploring.  As far as Christmas, at almost 16 the twins are old enough to see through the 'mom and dad' Xmas gift lie.  Make sure Jim educates his ex that tradition is done.",
