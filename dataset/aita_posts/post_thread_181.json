  "post content": "I recently uploaded a ad on Facebook market place saying I\u2019ll build a custom pc. Couple hours later I get a new message, I open it and someone wants me to build a pc for him, simple enough. He sends a picture of a pc that\u2019s easily 5 grand, I inform him of this and he says can you build it for 1200? I said not in a million years which he replies with make me a cool pc with a 3090 for $1200. For those who don\u2019t know 3090s are around 1 grand. I told him that\u2019s not going to happen I could make you a cool looking Pc but it\u2019s not going to have a 3090. He gets really mad saying he\u2019s 13 and has been earning money by mowing lawns for 3 years and he deserves this pc. I congratulate him and say I still can\u2019t do it in which he demands i take money out of my own pocket and pay for the rest. Blocked him and thought that was over. I told my gf about it and she said I was the a-hole. Now I have around 170k in the bank and she said I could\u2019ve easy payed for it which is true but I have no reason to do it. AITA?",

I had steel toe shoes from work and cut proof pants I wore to deal with the flying debris. I'm not letting a kid back there to \"mow\", they'll get seriously hurt! \n\nMy current house has a landscaping service built into the HOA dues. We don't need to pay someone else, we already pay for it. Plus, it's super dry here, so the lawn doesn't actually grow all that much anyway, and is only not dormant for about 3 months of the year. \n\nMy neighbor growing up was really particular about how his lawn was mowed, and wouldn't let anyone else do it. \n\nOur house growing up had a decently large front yard, and a pool in the back, so my dad wouldn't have let a random kid mow. Front was too large to do by push mower in the heat/humidity, the riding mower wasn't kid friendly (short people like kids couldn't push the brake without setting off the dead man switch and making it backfire. Learned that the hard way), and the back was too risky cause large water filled hole. \n\nAnd those are just some examples I can think of off the top of my head!",
