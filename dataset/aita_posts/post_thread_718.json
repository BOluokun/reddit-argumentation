  "post content": "I think everyone sucks except for my cousin, but I'll leave that to you beautiful people.\n\nI (28f) am married to a Green Beret (29m; yes, he\u2019s fine with being called a Green Beret). He\u2019s deployed rather often. I\u2019m used to it, but it sucks sometimes, and I miss him when he\u2019s gone. Anyway, I have a very large family who considers family events, particularly weddings, bridal showers, and baby showers, *very* important. Several months ago, while my partner was deployed, my cousin (24f) announced her engagement. Me, my sister, several of our other cousins, and a few of her friends were chosen as bridesmaids, since she doesn\u2019t have any sisters. Of course, we were all excited and volunteered to help with the planning. We helped pick the flowers, the invitations, our dresses, and hers. Then, about four weeks before the wedding, I found out my partner would be coming home from \\[REDACTED\\] on the wedding date. While the wedding was important to me, I love my partner more than anything and want to be there to meet him at the airport. So I called my cousin and told her that I was sorry, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. She was actually really calm about it and asked why. I told her my partner was coming home, and she said that was okay. Alright, cool. I assumed everything would be fine. Unfortunately, I assumed too soon. I was suddenly bombarded with texts and calls from the rest of the family saying I was a complete asshole and how dare I miss the wedding. My aunt (cousin\u2019s mom) was by far the angriest. I told her why I was missing the wedding, and she said my partner would be deployed a thousand more times, but my cousin would only get married once. I said I was sorry, but my cousin said it was okay and that my husband was very important to me. My aunt called me a selfish jackass and said that some \u201ckilling machine prick\u201d was not more important than the wedding. I told her she had no right to call my partner that. She said, \u201cBut it\u2019s true. Now quit bitching about Rambo and come to the goddamn wedding.\u201d I called her a bitch and hung up. I haven\u2019t spoken with my family since, except for my cousin and her fianc\u00e9 apologizing for everyone else's behavior and saying it's fine if I can't go.\n\nSo...AITA?\n\n**EDIT: Ladies and gentlemen (and people who don't identify as either), we have an update.** [**https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomThrowaway3435/comments/mz8i49/update\\_aita\\_for\\_skipping\\_a\\_family\\_wedding\\_after/**](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomThrowaway3435/comments/mz8i49/update_aita_for_skipping_a_family_wedding_after/)",

If he were deploying and heading out, then I could see your point -- but he's coming home for some period of time, so couldn't you just wait to see him? It seems fairly selfish of you to forego the wedding entirely after initially committing. \n\nObviously the aunt's comments are preposterous and inexcusable.",

She is definitely not an A H. Having one less bridesmaid, or choosing someone else to do it, won\u2019t change her wedding one bit. The family members giving you a hard time about this are totally out of line. It\u2019s not their wedding, and the bride is the only one you have to answer to for your decision not to come. Your aunt is absolutely ridiculous for saying what she said, and I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you never spoke to her again. She is totally out of line.\n\nPeople make wayyyy too much of weddings, to the point that it seems insane to me. That includes some people in these comments. It\u2019s a wedding, not the end of the world. Obviously your cousin understands it is not some tragedy or a betrayal of your family bond or whatever if you can\u2019t be there. The craziness about weddings as some inviolable \u201cspecial day\u201d that the whole world should revolve around really needs to stop.",
