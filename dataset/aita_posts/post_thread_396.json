  "post content": "My son (4) had a sleepover last night with a friend. This friend's parents were doing my wife and I a huge favor, because my wife's father had surgery yesterday, and we needed to be there and didn't get home until after midnight. So yes, this story begins with us already in debt to them. Anyway, at naptime today my son started freaking out because he couldn't find sleepy Dumbo (his stuffed animal) and he *cannot* sleep without sleepy Dumbo.\n\nI remembered that when I picked him up I didn't see sleepy Dumbo. So I text the mom and dad of the friend. I get no response. My wife is a wreck, so I'm not bothering her with this, but my son is freaking out. So I tell him we will get in the car and go get sleepy Dumbo and he slightly calmed down. So we drive over and I try to call them both on the way.\n\nWhen we get there, I knock, and we wait a bit with no answer. At this point my son starts freaking out more because he is afraid something happened to sleepy Dumbo. I try to reassure him, but he starts crying. I knock again, and the wife of the couple answers. She says she is working and asks what I want. I explain about sleepy Dumbo.\n\nShe again says she is working, and she says she doesn't have time to look for Dumbo and tells us to come back later. My son starts freaking out more. I ask if we can look. She says she needs to focus. I promise to be fast. She lets me in.\n\nWe get to his friend's room, sleepy Dumbo is on the bed. My son gets him, and I hustle us out. I thank the mom, but she is glaring at me. On the way home he hugs sleepy Dumbo the whole time. I remind him to be more careful with sleepy Dumbo in the future, and at home naptime commences peacefully.\n\nAbout an hour ago my wife and I both got this text. I'm going to copy paste it:\n\n{Me} and {my wife} I really don't appreciate the way {me} barged into my house earlier today while I was working. I know you both have a lot going on right now but the world doesn't revolve around you. {Her husband} and I agreed to do you a favor but that doesn't mean you get to just walk all over us. In the future if you call and we don't answer that means it isn't a good time to come over.\n\nI felt very embarrassed and guilty after reading that. My wife, however, is furious. She called the wife of the other couple some indelicate names. I am really grateful to them for agreeing to babysit for us, and I accept that I am to blame for forgetting sleepy Dumbo the first time. I don't know if asking to come in and get him is quite as big a deal as she's making it out though, and my wife is pissed. I don't know how much of that is misplaced fear for her dad though. Am I an asshole, or was this just an unfortunate situation?",

My phone is on silent 90% of the time so I would have missed it entirely.\n\nDropping by to see if I am home is no problem (IDK why a lot of people think that is a problem and would love an explanation) and if I was really unavailable due to work or otherwise I would not have answered the door.\n\nWhere it goes to AH territory for me is when insisting even after explaining so verdict to OP is YTA and to apologize. EDIT: So here I am agreeing with everyone that OP went to far with keeping to knock after a first try and insisting on coming inside etc.\n\nI just don\u2019t understand why everyone is so upset by people dropping by their houses?",

Some parents are different, but I never allowed my kid to throw tantrums like this. I forcefully put a stop to tantrums when she was little because I felt it was important that she learn that the world didn't revolve around her and sometimes things couldn't be the way she wanted them. Parents today rush to solve every issue, but the kid develops unrealistic expectations based on that helicopter behavior. I understand parents do it because it shuts up the immediate crying, but so does redirection, communication and a lot of other things.

Finally found someone who had one buried in a box somewhere and they sent it to me.  I was so goddamn excited to have a second one. So excited to show my then-4 year old. I wanted him to know it existed so he could take the backup on vacation/in the car because we wouldn't allow the OG one to leave the house for fear of it getting damaged. \n\nThe backup had the tag cut off. FML.\n\nTurns out the toy somehow loses all magic if the tag is cut off. Same exact toy, but the tag on the butt is gone and so, naturally, backup toy has sat unloved for two years now because my kid wants nothing to do with it. OG toy is still around, actually it's right next to me, and I dread the day when it rips or gets lost. I need to pack it away, but my son absolutely adores it and sleeps with it every night and we all talk about this one specific $1.50 clearance toy as if it's a real thing.
