  "post content": "Married to my husband for just over a year now and I think we have an awesome thing going. He is in the military and is currently deployed overseas which really sucks since it's the first one I've been through but it's what I signed up for. So to be totally upfront, I guess like a lot of guys, my husbands number one fantasy is to be with two girls. We've \"pillow talked\" about it a lot and he has said clearly \"if you ever get the chance to fuck another girl, do it, even if I'm not there.\" \n\nI was at a party on Saturday and after some drinks I started dancing with just about everyone but a friend's sister really got aggressive with me and before I even really knew what was happening she had her hands literally all over me. At first I was playfully dancing back but it was one of those moments where I knew in my head that if I didn't leave something was going to go down and I've never had that with a girl before. She asked me if I wanted to go for a walk and after some heavy kissing in a park (where all I thought of how my husband would love this) next thing I knew we were in an uber heading for my house. I asked the driver to take a picture of me kissing her with my hand on her bare boob which he gladly did. So we got to our house and literally yada, yada, yada and in the morning she left with a kiss and if I ever wanted to do it again to call her. I told her maybe but wanted to make sure she knew I was married, she said she loved married women. \n\n\nI sent the picture to my husband and instead of being excited he texted back \"what the fuck is this?\" that pissed me off and was like \"what do you mean? isn't It obvious?\" then he asked who took the pic and who's car was I in so I thought maybe that was his issue that he though there was another guy there and I wasn't being safe, when I told him it was the uber driver he text back \"holy fucking shit Sam you cheated on me!\" He pretty much ghosted me all day yesterday and I was sick to my stomach.\nHe skyped me later that night and we got in a huge screaming match with him saying over and over that I cheated. I tried explaining to him that while I enjoyed it, I really did it for him and his fantasy and that I couldn't wait to describe it to him in detail and I said what about ALL the times he told me things like \"if you can ever fuck another girl, do it?\" he responded that I was an idiot for not understanding that was just pillow talk. I asked him if he would have been ok had he been there and to my TOTAL surprise he said no that I should know that monogamy is monogamy. I told him in that case I was really sorry and I misunderstood him. He said well my misunderstanding led to a situation he doesn't know how to deal with and he needs some time to sort things out.\n\nAm I the asshole here? I swear to god if he had never said those words, I wouldn't have done this. I'm not really a lesbian (no insult to lesbians at all) and while I enjoyed it, this wasn't something I was itching to do.",

And you shouldn't have done it on the basis of pillow talk without confirming he was okay with it.  Adding non-monogamy to a relationship without it seriously fucking things up is something that takes a ton of discussion and careful planning.  You two did none of that.  It's going to take some serious effort, from both of you, to repair what you fucked up with your carelessness.",

I don't care that you ladies were cool with it and apparently so was the driver: your husband could report it to Uber and that is the kind of thing that gets drivers fired. NOT COOL. \n\nSecond: I get that you didn't plan on having sex with this woman (or any woman) when you went out, so this wasn't premeditated in any way. And yes, your husband's \"pillow talk\" statements were not at all vague. BUT, as soon as you knew where things were heading, you should have shut the lady down and, in a sober and non-sexually charged situation, discussed this with your husband before moving forward. THEN you could move forward (or not) once you were both on the same page. \n\nBecause you did cheat on him, even though your motives were innocent. He obviously never thought his hypothetical scenario would ever come to pass. You don't mention telling him you'd be DTF another woman, either. \n\nFurther more and from a wholly practical angle: what if you got an STD/STI? I'm not implying anything about this woman, only that disease prevention changes from heterosexual to homosexual (to polysexual) intercourse and you likely aren't familiar enough with it to be fully informed about the appropriate safety precautions. Yet another reason to have worked out all the details ahead of time. \n\nYou're in a shitty situation, OP. Best of luck to you in finding a happy resolution.",
