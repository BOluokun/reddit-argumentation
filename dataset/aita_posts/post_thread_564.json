Not wrong for feeling it is gross, but yta for saying it to your grandfather in that way\n\nFirstly, with my older sisters and mum aging- having a large age gap makes a huge difference. Their eyesight is getting worse, and it takes effort to focus to look at details. \n\nCleanliness takes effort. Sometimes trying very hard to clean doesn\u2019t pay off as their body betray them and miss parts or make things dirty quickly. \n\nNo one likes staying in a dirty place, but it takes its toll on people. You need to put in effort to get clean. But you don\u2019t have the mental/physical strength to clean either. So you just stay put and justify that it\u2019s ok. \n\nMy suggestion (which is very very hard to do), is to get the place cleaned up, then basic maintenance will be less overwhelming for him. I\u2019m not sure where you are but there are people/organisations that can/will help.",
