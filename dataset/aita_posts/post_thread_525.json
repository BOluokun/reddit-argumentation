  "post content": "Last Friday I made plans with a girl that I met on Bumble to meet up and go kayaking as a first time hangout. There wasn't much prior discussion as to what either person was interested in or looking for out of the meetup. It's worth noting that both her profile and mine indicated the \"Don't know yet\" category as to why we were on the app.\u00a0\n\nSo we get around to hanging out and get on the water. Everything is good, things are very flirty but also fun. It certainly all felt normal, natural and cool. We made references to a show we both knew quite a bit of and initially bonded over when chatting through the app.\u00a0\n\nEventually, it starts to get dark and we decide to head back to land. As we're headed back over, the topic of \"well what are you looking for?\" finally rears its gnarly head out. She talks about how she had just gotten back on \"dating apps\" and realistically wasn't all that sure. I explain how I'm still relatively new to the area (like a year) and don't see my current situation as anything permanent. This goes over fine and just about offers to introduce me to her friends in the area.\u00a0\n\nAs we get back on land and begin to load up the kayaks on her car, the conversation comes back to being friends. She nearly blurts out \"what about friends with benefits?\" to which I indicate that I'm not opposed but wouldn't want it to conflict with anything further. Things get the awkward, first time meeting question of whether or not to kiss the other person. We share a clumsy kiss leading to a second.\n\nAfter that, we head our separate ways and I get back. The discussion shifts into a bit more of a hookup or certainly a fwb status. We exchange a nude each to which the response turns into how we should have gone home with one another that evening. Come the next morning, I play it cool but talk about trying to make plans to hangout again. She gets back to me a bit later in the day and proceeds to say \"I don't want to be friends, and I don't want to hook up, I think I want a relationship\".\u00a0\n\nNaturally, my instincts go to think that I've messed something up and so I ask if there's anything I've done wrong or the like. She tells me no and proceeds to say that everything that transpired was a way of her past that she was over and trying to move past. OK, I get that. I tell her that its cool but I don't understand why friends move off the table, after she explicitly said that \"it's always good to add more friends\".\u00a0\n\nNow, I should mention that meeting up with this girl was like striking gold. She was cool, genuine (or so I thought) and we had a lot of good stuff in common. So, while I wasn't fully open to the idea initially of dating, I extend the olive branch because I was genuinely wowed by her (for this, I'm sure I'm the A-hole). I get a \"lemme think about it\" which ultimately led to \"I don't want to pursue anything\".\u00a0\n\nSo now I'm sitting here, after a whirlwind weekend of all of this, asking myself AITA for just trying to be friends and things moving in a weird way?",
