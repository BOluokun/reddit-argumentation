  "post content": "So here\u2019s a little backstory. My mom has always been an amazing mother. She has always taken care of me and my siblings and done pretty much everything for us. Ever since she divorced my father, she started using her days off work (this is usually her only free time) to take us out and do literally anything. This could be going to the store, playing mini golf of bowling, or anything that isn\u2019t just staying indoors. At first, me and my siblings had no other option as we were fairly young, around 13 years old, but now that I\u2019m 19 and in college I don\u2019t feel like going out with her anymore. I have nothing against her, I would just rather stay at home and keep doing my own thing. Today, after she asked me to go out and \u201cdo something\u201d I rejected her offer and later saw her crying. I asked her why to which she responded, \u201cI spend 9-10 hours working almost everyday just so that I can finally maybe go out with you guys, but you guys don\u2019t seem to care.\u201d I can\u2019t help but feel like an a-hole for not wanting to go out with her, but I really would just rather stay at home since we\u2019ve been going out and doing random things for as long as I remember. So AITA?\n\nSorry if I messed anything up, this is my first time using reddit so I\u2019m not sure how everything works.",

I can definitely relate to your mindset of it not exactly being the most fun you can have that night. Spend time with your mother.
