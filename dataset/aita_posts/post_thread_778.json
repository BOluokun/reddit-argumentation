  "post content": "I (25M) am quickly rising in my industry and I've definitely been noticed in industry specific magazines/websites, to the point of becoming known in it. Can't exactly say what the industry is, but I'll say that it's NOT entertainment related. Regionally this industry is quite known and important.\n\nAnyway I was interviewed by one of the websites which would publish my interview in print too. They asked me many questions but one of them asked about my experience in High School.\n\nLong story short, I fucking hated High School. I was an Ugly Duckling so High School represented a tough time. I was picked on a bit. Well I said in the interview \"Honestly? My High School sucked. Teachers sucked, every student I came across there, except the 2 friends I had were cruel too. Terrible terrible people. I succeeded because of my own personal power and strength\"\n\nWell this interview got around my hometown and a girl (25F) I knew from High School, who was one of thr condescending girls to me and who would call me names messaged me on Facebook. She said that my interview was unfair and lies. I asked her how was my experience a lie, she said that my behaviour didn't exactly lend itself to kindness.\n\nSo I looked back at my old Facebook posts and it was true that I did come across as the iamverysmart annoying type, however that doesn't excuse or justify being mean to someone so I responded back to her \"I've noted your objections, but I ain't retracting or changing anything. Deal with it\" and she responded calling me fucking asshole.\n\nI looked at her profile and it doesn't seem she did much with her life. I just went on with my life but I got some more angry messages. I'm still not gonna change it. AITA?",

You describe high school as a tough time and how you didn\u2019t fit in and had a tough time. However, what you describe as responding during the interview is quite different. That account externalizes all of the blame for the time into others\u2019 actions and character. \n\nThere is a huge difference between \u201cI was picked on a bit\u201d and \u201ceveryone except two people were terribly cruel\u201d. A huge difference between \u201cit was a tough time for me\u201d and \u201call my teachers and classmates were terrible people\u201d. \n\nI think YTA for painting everyone in such a broad and uniformly bad light and making your comments about how they were bad rather than about how you felt about the time. You are free to discuss specific issues or incidents, but it simply isn\u2019t actually possible that everyone at your high school was \u201cterrible\u201d, or that absolutely everyone sucked. It is possible you feel this way, but that is an effect of your memories of the time\u2014your experiences of school\u2014not their reality of being terrible. \n\nLastly, you can describe your success as being your own (as being a response to how badly you felt in school, even) without tearing everyone else down. Furthermore, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly relevant how the people who have critiqued your description have lived their subsequent lives \u2014 especially with regard to your judgment of their level of \u201csuccess\u201d.
