  "post content": "My  mom is married to \"Rick\" not even going to call him my stepdad. He does  not like me, does not speak to me, and I recently learned doesn't  actually know which of my kids is which. That being said we can hang out  and be civil. He just will not talk to me.\n\nRecently  we went to a beach with Rick, my mom, and my aunt and uncle. The set up  kind of sucked because the sand area was very narrow, so we had to walk  pretty far to get a spot. Since we have kids we had a lot of stuff, and  had to go back to the car. I told my wife to stay with the kids and I'd  get it even if I had to make two trips.\n\nAt  this point I don't know where my aunt was. My mom took her dog for a  little walk, and my uncle was also making a trip back to get some stuff  for my one year old cousin. So Rick was the only person sitting. My wife  asked Rick if he would keep an eye on the kids while she went to the  car. He said no. She told him he was being childish and it would only be  a minute.\n\nI did see her in the  parking lot, but she told me Rick was watching the kids. When we  returned my aunt yelled at me that we are irresponsible and stupid, and  that she had to go in the water and get my kids. My wife asked Rick what  was going on and he said he told her no, and called us both fucking  idiots. He said the kids were fine and he wouldn't have let them drown  (I agree with my aunt that they shouldn't have been out there)\n\nMy  wife yelled at Rick, and my aunt began to berate us (she was mad  because she didn't have a good spot to put her baby) At this point my  mom came down and asked what was going on. My wife began to yell at my  mom that she never should have married Rick, and this is her fault for  bringing him into the family.\n\nI  snapped at my wife and told her she always treats my mom like shit for  the most minor things, but she was irresponsible and owes our kids,  Rick, and my aunt an apology. I said she put out kids in danger, so how  am i supposed to trust her again, and said she needed to use her head.\n\nShe  began to cry and said I was being mean. She asked if I was going to  yell at my aunt for being a bitch, or yell at my mom for marrying Rick  and I said no. Now she is angry with me, and saying she doesn't want to  be around my mom anymore for marrying Rick. For reference our kids are  all under 5 and two can't swim.",
