  "post content": "Hey everyone, throwaway for all the usual reasons.\n\nMy wife  (F45) and I (M44) are hosting Christmas Day this year. She is a successful lawyer, her sister who is coming from out of state with her family, is also a lawyer and her husband is some sort of high flying consultant for a mining company. \n\nThey have never said anything directly to me, but apparently the sister has often told my wife that they both think I am not good enough for her, presumably because I don't have some corporate job. I do just fine, but I do work a lot....I am working on Christmas eve, and then again on the 26th. On Christmas day I will probably get up around 5am to start cooking, since among other things, I'm going to BBQ a brisket and some pulled pork, which take a long time. I love firing up the smoker, and I've always been complimented on my BBQ, even by said inlaws.\n\nSo here's the thing. My wife told me the other night that the brother in law recently did a stint in rehab. It came up when she was talking to her sister the other night about Christmas she had mentioned organising alcohol for the day and did her sister want anything in particular. Her sister replied that BIL had just gone through rehab, so she wasn't going to be drinking. She also said it would be great if we could all have a \" dry Christmas\" to make it easier on him.\n\nMy wife was obviously nervous about asking me since I suspect she had a good idea of my answer,  but when she floated the idea I laughed and said there was absolutely zero chance of me not having a few drinks on my one day off when I'm going to be cooking all day. \n\nAs I said, I'm working the next day so it's not like I was planning some huge bender.\n\nWe had a huge fight about it. \n\nShe thinks I'm being difficult and it wouldn't be that hard. I reminded her that these people don't even particularly like me, and they're coming into our home, and if he couldn't handle being around alcohol at all, maybe he should still be in rehab.\n\nOn reflection the last bit was a pretty mean thing to say but I was quite emotional by then.\n\nTell me true Reddit....AITA?\n\nEdit after many comments. \n\nAs I said somewhere below, I am not a heavy drinker, and I was not planning on getting loaded. I won't need to hide alcohol in a different vessel or anything like that. I recognise my answer was more out of spite than any issues with going for a day without drinks.\n\nI said my wife was nervous about asking me, probably because she knows how much I like to chill with a beer or two while I'm bbqing. To the people who twisted this into her being scared of me....it's really not like that.\n\nI didn't provide extra details on the BIL and SIL since the stories on here are often long, but it isn't just a vague feeling that they look down on me. I  could provide many examples but one that comes to mind is last time they were here, he was talking about his new car and then said, 'what year is your truck from?'\nWhen I said it was a 2009 model he replied, \"Oh man, I can't believe that thing still runs. Must be like driving an antique. Do you need a special license?\"\n\nStuff like that is pretty constant when they visit.\n\nOnce when they were here I took him golfing. He kept trying to get me to bet with him on particular holes, which I refused. That evening when SIL asked him about our day, he said it was OK,  but could have been more 'interesting'....clearly referencing my non betting.\n\nI have apologised to my wife for the fight and acknowledged that I was out of line.",

BIL's alcoholism is his to manage, asking someone he views as inferior to him to manage his alcoholism for him is plain fucking ridiculous.
