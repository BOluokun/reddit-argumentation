  "post content": "My ex husband and I share custody of our 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son. We have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like I have the kids Friday after school and then he gets them Monday after school. I get them back Wednesday after school and then he gets them Friday after school and then the week flip flops. We've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. I'm a nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad. \n\nRecently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. My ex agreed if there was a weekend trip I wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but I honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips. \n\nI was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. My sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. My SIL seemed to understand where I was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever I was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the NYC shopping trip I had planned for December and my son would happily join me for my Saturday morning spin classes. I considered that but my SIL loves taking her kids everywhere so I don't know that she is aware of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever you go. They were really making me feel like an asshole though. AITA?",

It is sad that you'd prefer to do things on your own and not have obligations. Not gonna lie, it would make me really sad if my mom told me this. You just have to make do with the time that you do have and take into consideration your ex's schedule when planning stuff.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the platinum, gold, and silver kind strangers!",

That there are so few things as purely human and loving and without guile as a child who just wants to be held by you, and most everyone looks back on those moments as the best part of parenting and some of the best in their lives (and I have a demanding fulfilling career whose high points also go on that list.) And it\u2019s gone so fast, but you\u2019re still the same adult who got trained to love that way. But now there\u2019s no one who wants that love anymore. I feel for grandparents a lot more now.\n\nOP, 10 and 12 are almost to the point where they won\u2019t want or need you much anymore. You\u2019ll regret it. No one dies wishing they\u2019d shopped or gone to spin class more. Be grateful they even want alone time with you now, a lot of pre teens don\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s precious. Childfree time is great, but you aren\u2019t childfree. Don\u2019t give up the good parts of being a mom or you\u2019ll only be left with the bad parts.",

The welfare of the children should come first, no doubt about that, but parents need to take time for themselves, keep up a hobby(s) or interest(s) that do not revolve around the kids. I hate the perception that parents who maintain a life or personality outside of \\[child\\]'s mommy/daddy are selfish. They're *not* selfish. It's called self-care and it's healthy for both the parent and the children. \n\nWhen you make the children your identity and they eventually grow into independent adults, what will you do? Will you pick up the withered remains of the life you abandoned 2-3 decades ago? Or (more likely) will you cling to your children and view their every achievement as your own? Where will you find your pride or your purpose in life? Is it to badger your children to have grandchildren so you can start this whole cycle again? \n\nWhat about your husband/wife? After the children leave, will you still remember what it's like to be lovers? Or are you just parenting partners now? If it's the latter, you'll find yourself living with a stranger after the children leave. I witnessed so many divorces when my friends and I left for college.\n\nIt's a pathetic existence and it's not necessary if people like you would stop insisting that any mother/father that wants some time away from their kids are horrible unfit parents.",

My parents split when I was 2; my dad had full custody and I went to my mom\u2019s every other weekend, half the summer, and every holiday except Christmas. Sometimes my mom didn\u2019t pick me up on her weekends, and when I was at her house we never did anything together. I just watched TV or played alone with my toys. I only have two memories of doing fun things with my mom. We live 1,000 miles apart now and while we talk on the phone a few times a week, I haven\u2019t seen her in over 10 years.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, was the complete opposite. So many memories of fun things as a kid. He was a great dad, despite being so young and working all the time. That\u2019s why two years ago, when my dad got laid off from his job, my husband and I invited him to come live with us and start over in our state. My dad now lives less than a mile from us and he\u2019s enjoying his new life and being a grandpa. \n\nHow you treat your kids when they\u2019re young definitely impacts your relationship with them when they\u2019re an adult.",
