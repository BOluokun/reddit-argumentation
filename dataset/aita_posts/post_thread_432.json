  "post content": "A couple of weeks ago I accidentally left my car keys in my uniform pants at work, and left my pants in my locker (I don\u2019t wear my uniform home for multiple reasons. I just bring it home to wash - I have 2)\n\nI realized when I got to the subway station, where I\u2019d  parked, that I\u2019d left my keys back at work - a half hour train ride and no guarantee I\u2019d be able to get back in the building (it was after midnight).\n\nI called my husband to ask him to bring me the spare key. Twenty-two times. I tried my son, but he was asleep (he\u2019s 19 and has a car) and didn\u2019t wake up when I called a second time. And I tried a friend. I didn\u2019t want to call too many people because again, it was after midnight. \n\nI kept calling my husband hoping eventually he\u2019d hear his phone. \n\nI wound up taking an Uber home.\n\nI needed to go get my car because they ticket after 2 am usually. So, when I got home, and I was pretty upset that I\u2019d called 22 times and he hadn\u2019t answered. I continued trying to call him the whole way home in the Uber. \n\nWhen I got home, I went inside and up to the bedroom and woke him up.  I was pissed that had this been a serious emergency, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get through to him. \n\nHe kept saying he had my number in his \u201cfavourites\u201d so that if I called twice, the second time it would go through. But he had the phone on SILENT!  And then put it on top of something soft. So he didn\u2019t hear it vibrating. \n\nHe complained that I was mad at him for something I did. I replied that no, I was mad at ME for forgetting my keys. That was 100% on me. \n\nI was mad at HIM for not having his phone on and that he\u2019s unreliable in an emergency, which thankfully, this wasn\u2019t a huge one. \n\nSo, AITA for waking him up and being pissed that I couldn\u2019t reach him in what wasn\u2019t a big emergency, but what if it had been?",

I can't tell you the number of times I've accidently placed my phone on silent because I accidently keep pressing that damn down volume key when talking on my cellphone.  Good thing is my kids/family/friends can still reach me in case of an emergency at my Mom's number since she still have a landline with the same telephone number she's had for 35+ years and I live upstairs.",
