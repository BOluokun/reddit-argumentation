  "post content": "Non-native speaker here.\n\nThe title can be misleading but let me explain myself.\n\nMy gf (22F) an I (23F) have been together for 2 years. I have been dying my hair for 3 years now, and from the time we got together I always asked my gf, what color does she want for my hair. When I had ideas, that she didn't like, she always told me and I've never get them done, even tho, I wanted to. For some time now, I wanted to get a buzzcut, but she always told me in an insulting and really hurtful manner, that she wouldn't even hold my hands when we walk or she will walk beside me, because I'll look bad and she won't like my hair that way, etc. And she was dead serious about these comments. Her insults countinued, until I got rid of this idea all together, because she simply killed my joy and excitement.\n\nNow, she got this idea some months ago, that she wanted to dye her hair black and red. I honestly hated this from the get go, because I don't like red as a hair color, at all, and I told her in a respectfull manner, that I don't like this idea, and don't want her to have this type of colour. She told me, to suck it up, and that she will do it, no matter what I say. She knew, how my feelings were towards this topic, but she always brought it up at random points in our conversations, which escalated into arguments every time. At one time, she told me, she don't care, if I get a buzzcut, and she is sorry, but I think it's just a way to make me feel bad, for not liking her idea and asking her, not to do it, because she \"gave me permission.\"\n\nYesterday she got her hair done, and I feel really bad. I don't like how it looks, and frankly, she hurt my feeling as well, because If I respected her hurtful wishes, why couldn't she do the same thing?\n\nI told her, that after what she has done, she had no right, to be mad at me, and that I'm really angry, but she told me, that it's her hair, and she can do what she wants, despite her ongoing insulting.\n\nAITA for arguing with her on this topic?",

Although its cool to have preferences, it's not really cool to push it onto our partners. You were both doing that here in some way. \n\nI don't fault you for getting angry. Nobody should deal with their partner telling them what to do with their bodies. But if there is an issue, it needs to be actually addressed. It sounds like the issue is her controlling and manipulative behavior towards you. What do you think will be a way to approach this situation where both parties can stay calm, and you both can walk out with some sort of compromise? Is that even possible with her? If not, you should be running. \n\nI should clarify, the majority of my previous response wasn't about you. Do you believe your girlfriends behavior towards you regarding this subject is in any way healthy? I am honestly very concerned reading about how she treats you.",
