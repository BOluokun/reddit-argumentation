  "post content": "Alright, buckle up because this is embarrassing and kinda gross.\n\nI (20F) live with 3 other people (22M, 23M, 21F). We\u2019re not super close but we are all friendly and polite to one another. I\u2019m going to school for a biology degree and I currently intern at a wildlife sanctuary. This means I come in contact with a bunch of sick and injured wild animals. I am very diligent about hygiene and preventative measures but shit happens to the best of us.\n\nTo make a long story short, I contracted a common type of parasitic worm due to my job. Super gross but not as big of a deal as you\u2019d think. I went to my doctor, got prescribed meds to kill the worms, and in a few days I\u2019ll be worm-free. No big deal, I\u2019m not stressed over it. It\u2019s a risk I accepted when I took my job and it poses no significant risk to my health.\n\nI did not tell my roommates because 1) I don\u2019t think they need to know or are entitled to know my medical issues, 2) I made sure to quarantine to my room and avoid shared spaces as an extra precaution so there is almost no chance of cross-contamination. The only way you can spread this specific species in through feces so the risk is minimal, and I diligently wash my hands after using the bathroom, etc.\n\nWell, one of my roommates found my prescription bottle in the kitchen and looked up the medication name. She flipped her shit. She confronted me and told me that I need to disclose health issues like that with her and my other roommates, and that I\u2019m \u201cknowingly exposing them to disease\u201d by not telling them.\n\nI get it, the thought of worms is gross, it isn\u2019t fun to think about. But I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing my health issues with my roommates especially when there is basically no risk to them. They aren\u2019t entitled to that information imo. \n\nTwo of my roommates think I\u2019m a huge asshole and one is on my side (he\u2019s also a biology major, similar field of study). Mostly I\u2019m just kicking myself for accidentally leaving my meds in the kitchen.\n\nAITA here? Am I expected to tell my roommates about this kind of stuff?\n\nEDIT: My doctor was not concerned with me spreading it through my household, and it doesn\u2019t require my roommates to be treated since the risk is so low. It isn\u2019t pinworm.\n\nEDIT #2: I didn\u2019t come here to argue about my hygiene, I know I am careful and thorough, and that wasn\u2019t what I came here asking about. Also, you are spreading blatant misinformation about parasites. I can accept that I suck for not telling my roommates but stop making wild assumptions and calling me a gross unhygienic person :/",

Whether she doesn't wash long enough or doesn't scrub under her nails, OP has shown that her hygiene precautions aren't as reliable as she considers them to be.\n\nSecond, OP is making assumptions about roommates hygiene. All it would take is one of them touching a dirty item (doorknob, light switch, flusher) and not washing their hands. Perhaps the main washroom is occupied and one person desperately needs to pee, so s/he uses OP's bathroom in an emergency. And since OP hasn't warned them...the roommates won't be careful about washing up. \n\nSo, regardless of OP's claims that the roommates could never possibly be exposed, the chances of exposure are not that insignificant.
