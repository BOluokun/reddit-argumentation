He's moving on June 1st.\n\nHe didn't really help me move, except for driving things from my old apartment to the new one.\n\nHe asked me if I could help him move, and I say that I would check, since I have a pretty bad ankle that we're trying to heal and I'm working a lot ( I'm a medical worker). I work night shift, so I mostly sleep at daytime\n\nHe told me that his dad and few of his friends would help him move.\n\nWould I be a a--hole if I didn't help him move?",
