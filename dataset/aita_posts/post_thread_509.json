  "post content": "Hi r/AmITheAsshole. Longtime listener,  first time caller here. \n\nLong story short. My girlfriend and i currently rent a 3 bedroom house in a pretty expensive city in my state. Both of us make okay money but we would not be able to afford our house without roommates. Well one of our roommates left suddenly to take care of her dad who is in bad health. No big deal, we found another roommate who was willing to pay 100 more a month than the previous roommate, lowering mine, my girlfriend's and our second roommates rent. However our new roommate has kids. Now i work a lot, I'm in sales so i normally work a 40 hour a week job plus quite a bit of overtime so i wasn't really too involved in the search for a roommate. My girlfriend gets off arround 2-3pm and i get off arround 7 most days. Needless to say,  i really didn't get a say in who moved in. Not a huge fan of kids but my girlfriend let our new roommate move in due to some personal issues she was having that required her to move immediately and since they know each other from highschool, she let her move in without consulting me much on it but i did ultimately give her the go ahead to do so. I don't have a problem with helping someone in need who would otherwise be homeless. Been in that position before and it sucks. \n\nEarlier today,  I was cleaning the trash out and got excited because i found an extra box and was like \" fuck yeah! This box is gonna make things so much more convenient!\" ( I get excited easily, part of my ADHD I guess ) anyways, i said this in front of her kids ( i think ones 11 months and the others about 3 years old?) The mother didn't seem to care but my girlfriend whispered to me that need to watch my mouth now that there is a kid in the house. Now i normally swear like a sailor in casual conversation. My dad was a biker and a factory worker so i was very much raised with \"Fuck, shit and ass\" in my vocabulary and i see no problem with using those words in normal conversation. (Obviously not at work or around certain people)\nSo i dont see my language as a big deal, and it definitely seems like the mother doesn't care and until she comes forward and says something, I really don't care either. \n\n\nWould I be the ass hole if i had a conversation with my girlfriend later and tell her while i get where she is coming from, im not going to censor myself in my own home?",

I think it would be the kind thing to do to be more mindful of your language - I get where you're coming from, but it's really not that much of a burden to modify a little so you're not constantly streaming obscenities.",
