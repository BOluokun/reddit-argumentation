That is until it was, why are you married??? You're so young? Most young marriages fail! Why would you get married? Are you religous? There has to be some weird reason right? I got slightly defensive of my marriage, especially when it came to one of the people being like, i could never have handled being married that young! Like we are not anyone else and we are doing just fine. Im curious if im the A-hole here for being slightly defensive?",

It is not super common and very public if you wear wedding rings so people feel like it is acceptable to ask about and they are just taking an interest, or making conversation.  \n\nEither joke around with them and tell them you felt like you were on the fast track to crazy cat lady and you were trying to duck your destiny if it is a friend or in a casual setting. or I usually tell people \"it just felt like the right time\" or \"yeah pretty crazy right?\" if I don't want to have a conversation with them or it is someone I need to be professional with.  Don't let people bug you.  You make your own decisions and no matter what people are going to judge you.  If you think you did the right thing who cares what the bank teller thinks.  \n\nAlso start saving your money while you are young! DINK is the greatest time to get a house payment together.  Live off a single salary or as close to it as possible and bank the other one for a few years and you will set yourself up forever.",

The majority doesn't. \nAlso \"love\" is imo not enough reason to get married. I love my partner, I have no intention of ever leaving. Not enough reason to get married though. I realize that might be strange for you, I don't condemn marriage. I am just pointing out that marriage at your age seems strange to a lot of people.",

Most kids haven\u2019t even graduated high school before 18.
