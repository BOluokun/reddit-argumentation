  "post content": "For context I am mixed race but look \u201cwhite passing\u201d, although for the most part I am racially ambiguous. I grew up with my Jamaican family so some of my mannerisms are what would usually be associated with black culture. \n\nI was in a shopping mall when I got into an argument with another shopper who pushed me on the escalator. A black male security guard came over to see what was happening and as he did I happened to call the woman a common Jamaican insult. I usually try to refrain from doing this but there was a lot of give and take insults going on and my temper got the better of me and when it does, the Jamaican just comes out.\n\nThe situation finally de-escalated but as I was walking off the security guard stepped in front of me and told me \u201clittle white girls [I\u2019m 23] shouldn\u2019t be using Jamaican language\u201d and that it\u2019s a \u201cdisgusting insult to Jamaican culture\u201d because I \u201cdon\u2019t understand or respect the people\u201d and that I should leave the mall because I was racist.\n\nI told him I was actually mixed race and knew exactly what the words meant and that he should mind his business. My lock screen on my phone is a family photo which I held up to show him. I told him I would not be leaving if he didn\u2019t kick the other lady out also (although neither of us did anything worthy of being asked to leave, just a bit of an argument). I walked off without letting him say another word (he didn\u2019t try to stop me) and carried on my day. \n\nWhen I got home however the situation was nagging me. I feel like I was unfairly judged and that the security guard was actually the racist one. So I wrote a formal complaint to the mall and provided details of the guard that addressed me. I did accuse him of racism and of unfairly trying to kick me out. \n\nMy boyfriend thinks I overreacted and could cost him his job and because I don\u2019t look obviously black the security guard wasn\u2019t wrong to call me white. He thinks because he didn\u2019t actually kick me out I can\u2019t complain. AITA for complaining about him?\n\nEDIT: because people want to know how the argument happened. This wasn\u2019t the original basis of my question so I didn\u2019t put it in. I more wanted to know about the security guard but if y\u2019all find it important: \nShe put her hand on my back and pushed me forward two steps because I unintentionally stepped on the toe of her shoe (I just put my foot on the step behind me, didn\u2019t even know she was there). I admit I jumped the bat on getting a little angry but the woman had literally pushed me before I had a chance to apologise. She started the insults by asking if I was blind or \u201cjust fucking dumb\u201d and then I kind of lost my temper. She called me a fat whore, I called her a bitch and so on.\n\nEDIT 2: I called her a bumboclaat. Wasn\u2019t my classiest reaction, I\u2019ll admit. Didn\u2019t put it in the original post because I wasn\u2019t sure of Reddit\u2019s rules.\n\nFINAL EDIT: thank you everyone for your judgments and views. I am aware that I could have handled the argument with the lady better and I accept I suck for that but tbh it barely affected my day. After hearing from everyone I no longer feel bad for reporting the security guard; he was racist and a little bit sexist and he needs to know that\u2019s not okay. I feel better having talked about it and heard other people\u2019s stories, I\u2019m glad I came to AITA.",
