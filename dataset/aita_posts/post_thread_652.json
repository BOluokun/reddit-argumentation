  "post content": "Me (35f) and my husband (40m) have had a lot of ups and down these few years. My husband lost his mother to Covid. We had a baby. My husband was laid off. I was able to secure a new job and I am now the bread winner. \n\nWith everything that has happened my husband said he wanted to have a less stressful job as a server. He said he would still be able to make enough money to pay for his part of the bills but he didn\u2019t want to go back to a manager job. I said I am adamantly against this but if it\u2019s what you need to get your mind straight then so be it. \n\nNow every day he is coming home and complaining about how he is not getting enough tables and how he hates doing all the side work. He will also complain about how the other managers suck and they\u2019re not doing their job. He will go on for hours about how everyone is not following safety protocols and not doing the proper cleaning methods. \n\nToday I had enough and said honey this is what you picked, you wanted to be a server  and this is what a servers life is. He came back and said that I was mean and he didn\u2019t think the restaurant would be like this. I said no you want the restaurant to run the way you think is right and your mad that there not because your not a manager. Then I said you made your bed this is what you wanted to do so this is on you and you need to stop complaining. \n\nNow he is giving me the silent treatment. AITA?",

Go for it with my full support.  (Husband feels strong and supported and understood and valued)\n\nHusband says being a server is not all I thought it would be, there are problems and stressors and I don\u2019t like it.  Wife, I\u2019m so sorry to hear it\u2019s not what you hoped, I know you can find something that\u2019s the right fit for you (inspiring confidence).  How can I help and support you ? \n\nIn the above - The husband feels valued, heard and free to figure out his life and what feels better for him.  He\u2019s madly in love with his wife and adores her for being so supportive and for letting him be autonomous and for making him feel loved and supported when he admits he\u2019s thinking he made a mistake.\n\nWhen you struggle someday, make a mistake or have midlife crisis issues, or something else, how do you want him to treat you ? \n\nKindness and love are, to me, the best way.",
