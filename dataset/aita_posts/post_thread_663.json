  "post content": "hey AITA! i never thought i\u2019d be posting here, but here i am.\n\ni (30F) am currently 5 months pregnant and i recently learned that i am having a girl! i also have a 3 year old son, who is named after his father. now that we know we are having a girl, we are talking more in-depth about names. my husband was dead set on a Jr, so i didn\u2019t get to choose that name and i am enjoying thinking of possibilities.\n\nto complicate things, my family has a long standing tradition of naming the first born daughter \u201cAraminta\u201d or a similarly old-fashioned and uncommon, mouthful type of name. my mom, my grandma, both their grandmas and their grandma\u2019s grandmas are all \u201cAraminta\u201d. i am not the first born daughter, so my name is not Araminta, but my older sister died several years ago before she could pass along the name. while she was sick, we talked about the name and she said i should pass it down to my daughter should i have one.\n\nnow that the reality of the baby is looming, everyone is highly opinionated. my dad thinks that i promised my sister and i am therefore obligated to do as she asked. my mom is opposed, because she thinks my sister was the last Araminta and that i can\u2019t rightfully pass down the name. my grandma just thinks that the name sucks and that it will hold the baby back. Hubby agrees with grandma.\n\nlast night, at a dinner, my brother\u2019s wife suggested that we name the baby Ari, or some name that Ari can be a nickname for, since that was my sister\u2019s nickname. i loved this idea! \n\nbut of course, everyone has an opinion. my dad thought it was a great compromise, but it turns out my husband used to date a girl named Ariana, so it\u2019s absolutely poisoned and can\u2019t be used. cue the arguing between those two. my dad said i am TA for not honoring my sister\u2019s wishes. my husband thinks i am TA because i didn\u2019t abandon the idea second he voiced his opposition, never mind the fact he got the Jr he wanted. Mom thinks i am TA for not caring that she\u2019s still grieving and doesn\u2019t want a baby Araminta when her baby is gone.\n\ni lost my temper. i told everyone that i was starting to really not care what ANYONE thinks. stormed off, had my sister in law take me and my son to Baskin Robbins, then went home.\n\nmy husband has since apologized for not taking into consideration the significance of the name, my word to my sister, and how conflicted i felt. but he still thinks i\u2019m TA for not caring what he thinks.\n\ngrandma said i\u2019m TA because i didn\u2019t need to fly off the handle and disrespect my fragile mom.\n\nand my 3 year old said just name the baby Pudding.\n\ni feel generally terrible faced with the realization that i am going to hurt someone\u2018s feelings. and i\u2019m really feeling like i might really be TA if i can\u2019t figure out how to reconcile all of this.\n\nAITA?\n\nedit: thank you all for your insights and kindness! After sleeping on it and eating a good breakfast on it, i feel much more balanced and assured. it is a damned if i do/damned if i don\u2019t situation, and knowing my family after we\u2019ve been through what we\u2019ve been through, when the dust settles i think they\u2019ll see that.\n\nthis wasn\u2019t the first time this came up, but we haven\u2019t had a chance to really calmly talk about it - and i think that\u2019s our problem. my parents are grieving in two completely opposite ways - dad clings, mom represses - and they are working on that, themselves.\n\ni want to respect my mom, honor my sister, and give the baby a functional name (which the family name just ISNT). my husband and i both love the suggestion to use the name as a middle name and got a good laugh that it genuinely didn\u2019t even occur to us in the heat of the moment!\n\nmy son is actually HILARIOUS and what makes it even funnier is he\u2019s being 100% serious so he gets all offended if you laugh. My sonshine \ud83d\udc99\n\nall your great name ideas are adorable but alas, the name isn\u2019t actually Araminta!",

It\u2019s very different from the other thread for that reason. Also unlike the other post, the OP had a close relationship with the person she wants to name her child after. In the other post the sister used that name as a weapon against the OP, but in this one the OP desperately wants to honor her sister and her wishes, without hurting her mother if possible. Intentions matter when it comes to determining if someone is an AH. The Grandma is essentially saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care what my dying daughter wanted, or how my other daughter feels about losing her sister, only my grief matters.\u201d The grandma isn\u2019t an AH, but it doesn\u2019t make her right. She has the right to feel the way she does, but OP also has the right to grieve in her own way, including honoring her sister by giving that name to her daughter. If OP doesn\u2019t use her sister\u2019s name like she promised she may end up feeling guilty the rest of her life. Ten years from now when things aren\u2019t as raw as they are right now, even Grandma might regret not giving her blessing for the name, if her daughter doesn\u2019t use it.
