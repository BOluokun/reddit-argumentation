It is so difficult to discuss end of life situations with family and the fact that you had an anxiety attack shows that you care about your mom. I am sorry that you lost your dad and although it is important to recognize your mother has a lot of responsibilities right now, it needs to be made clear that your feelings are valid as well.",
