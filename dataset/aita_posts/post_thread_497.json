  "post content": "Okay, I normally never post but I would truly like to know if I am in the wrong here.\n\nWe are on vacation in Austria for a whole week (for those who do not know, they speak German there. I however do not...). We did some super fun activities including rafting and sledding (on those iron rails, super fun!), but in the end I mostly looked forward to going to a Stift (Abbey, or Monastery or however you want to translate this). \n\nI really love to learn so I was truly looking forward to this. The best part of my holiday always is going to Cathedrals, Castles or, in this case, an Abbey. I like to see those things and learn about these monuments, so I truly looked forward to going to the Abbey. I looked it up beforehand, there was a tour and I convinced my family to go!   \n\nWell, today we went. And when we got there, we were in that tour with two Frenchmen and a German. The tour guide asked us what language we would like the tour to be, and I asked it to be in English. She (the tour guide) speaks (as i know of) proper English, German, and French. The Frenchmen asked it to be in French, the German asked it to be in German (all logically...). She said she would not like to do the tour in three languages, but it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if she would have had to do it. It would just take a little longer. \n\nSo then my mom really quickly caved in and said only German and French is fine. My mother is sufficient in fluent, but not a sufficient interpreter. So that\u2019s that... The tour was only done in German and in French...\n\nThe thing I loved to do the most on holiday was for me a big disappointment because I was not able to understand a word in German. I really tried my best because I\u2019d have really loved to know what she said but it was just not possible for me to understand what she said. \n\nI became quite mad by the fact that I was not able to hear the tour, which I looked forward for quite some time (didn\u2019t do anything bad, I was just visibly mad). I said this to my mom, but she said that she\u2019s done all that she\u2019s can and that the tour guide really can\u2019t do it in three languages. I did not ask the tour guide again because my mom would have became mad if I did.\n\nDuring the tour, my mother told me to get over myself and that there was nothing she could have done to make sure the tour would also have been in English. \n\nI disagreed and became mad at my mom because this was the ONE thing I truly cared about this whole holiday, because to tell you all the truth - haven\u2019t told this to anyone because it seems ungrateful for this vacation - I\u2019d just as much would have loved to stay home this week EXCEPT for the abbey. \n\nSo, was I the A-hole for getting mad the tour was not in a (for me) understandable language? And for getting mad after my mom telling me to get over myself?\n\nEdit: \u2018I said this ... if I did\u2019\nI think the original post is still in the comments.\n\nMy mom knows I do not understand German\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll be going to sleep now. I\u2019ll reply in the morning if my WiFi is working (it\u2019s a bit wobbly here where I am staying.\n\nGood night!",
