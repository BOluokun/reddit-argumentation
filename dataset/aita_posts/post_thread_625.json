  "post content": "I (58m) have two daughters. One from a previous marriage and another from my wife's previous marriage. Both daughters are around the same age (think mid-twenties). My daughter Allie has never gotten along with her stepsister Johanna. If Johanna invited Allie to a movie, Allie was suddenly super busy and had no time. If Johanna wanted to come with Allie to a party, Johanna wasn't invited and there was no way she could bring her. She'd rip up Joanna's things and would blame Johanna when she'd be grounded. \n\nJust the run of the mill petty teenager bullstink. Johanna was a good sport and always seemed to take things on the chin. Her explanation was always that \"sisters fight\". Until about maybe three or four summers ago Allie was home from college and was going through a rough breakup that was causing her grades to tank which put her on academic probation. Allie was upset and was taking it out on everyone, especially Johanna. My wife and I told her to cut it out and she seemed to catch on that her behavior wasn't gonna be accepted. Come to find out after Allie leaves to go back to college that she'd completely destroyed Johanna's scrapbook with pictures of her dad and destroyed a lot of the shirts she had left of his. Johanna didn't make a stink about it in front of us but that night the house stunk of E6000 and mod podge. You could guess what she spent the night doing. After that incident Johanna had completely given up on Allie. Allie has a birthday coming up, Johanna wouldn't even sign the card. Allie is in town for the weekend, unless it's a holiday or family event, Johanna wasn't there. And honestly we didn't blame her.\n\nNow the issue is that Allie wants Johanna to let things go and let bygones be bygones. Johanna is getting married soon, and Allie wants an invite. It was brought up this past week at a family dinner (Johanna and her fiance as well as their son attended/Allie and her wife and two girls attended as well). Allie brought up how the kids were the same age and how it'd be cool after the wedding if the kids could hang out. Allie also asked what she should wear to Johanna's wedding and if she'd be a bridesmaid. Johanna pretty much laid it out for Allie that she wasn't coming and that the kids wouldn't be seeing each other outside of family events.The night was pretty tense afterwards and I asked Johanna if there was any way she could forgive Allie. She said she wanted nothing to do with her and I told her I fully understand that she carries a lot of hurt from how Allie treated her. Allie came to me after Johanna left and pretty much begged me to convince Johanna to move past things. I told her that had she been a more considerate and kind person back then that maybe she'd have a chance at a relationship with her stepsister. I told her that she made her bed and she needs to lay in it. She said I'm a a-hole and that any good father would want to see his kids reunite. \n\nAITA for telling her she deserves this?\n\nInfo: For everyone asking and making assumptions about my parenting, Allie was never allowed to slide with anything she did to her sister. She was grounded, she had things taken from her, we replaced the things we would that she broke and we made sure Johanna was supported and validated throughout the years. We never told Johanna to get over anything, we never told her she had to forgive Allie. When we offered Allie therapy, she was 14. We weren't going to force our daughter to go to therapy where chances were, she could just tell her therapist she didn't want to be there and be uncooperative, and most likely have the therapist stop seeing her as we can't and weren't gonna force a kid to be somewhere she didn't want to be, just for her to lash out at her sister even worse.\nWhen Allie destroyed those things she was banned from coming back until she apologized and made things right by Johanna. Johanna said herself she didn't want the apology and my wife and I did our best to surround her with love while she was grieving the loss of those things she cared for. Johanna moved out so the punishment was moot. We are aware Allie sucks, we did everything we could within reason. I didn't raise Allie to be this way,we didn't encourage this nor did we allow her to believe the behavior was acceptable.\n\nEdit: This thread is an absolute pit of people who don't seem to understand some kids just aren't receptive. I'm kind of done seeking internet help here, you all seem wonderful and I'll be sure that on the next go around I toss my kid to a psych ward and pit all blame on the Healthcare system for not fixing them. Jesus christ, never become parents.",

Good on Johanna for setting her boundaries.\n\nOP, you're both TA and NTA. You're TA for how you raised your daughters and the fact that you allowed the abuse to go on for so long. But you do get points for recognizing that Allie has gotten herself into this mess, and that Johanna wants nothing to do with her.

But the escalation of her behavior over time is where the parents had a serious responsibility to try something different because what they were doing wasn't working. \n\nI really appreciate that you mentioned 'to either child' because this didn't hurt only Johanna. Now that it is actively hurting his bio daughter and future generations, he sees how the combination of many years of implicit messages and actions across the entire family (he is not the only one to blame, for certain) has gone downhill.  I see parents/caregivers get really angry for someone pointing the things out all the time: \"I did the best I could!\"  No one is saying he didn't do anything but that truly good parenting needs to be more than just survival mode \"get them through the 'tough teen years' then everything will be fixed\".  \n\nAnd I very likely wouldn't label him TA if we time traveled 10 years back because of course there's a ton of info missing. And I feel for the big load of guilt that probably hit him after reading people's replies (his *externalizing* that anger towards others is, much like the daughter, not ok though). But he is TA in the exact situation he posted about because after everything he described he still made the conscious choice to go to Johanna and ask *her* to change (though I'm glad he respected the no for now) before setting the limit with bio daughter. \n\nIt's really amazing that someone who has been through similar to this story like you have been can still be empathetic towards others like OP and daughter.

That's why Allie's behavior hurt you and your wife *for years.* When she was cruel to Johnna, she didn't just hurt Johnna, she broke you and your wife's hearts. Parents want their children to be good people, and every parent dreads their child being the bully.\n\nExplain that for years Allie didn't just hurt Johanna, she hurt you and your wife, and she to this day makes you feel guilty and like a failure as a parent. It was your job to raise Allie into a decent person who treated others with kindness, and somehow you failed. You don't know exactly what you did wrong but you're sorry that you weren't able to guide her into being a good person. It is the biggest regret and disappointment of your life.\n\nDespite how Allie acted, your love for her is unconditional because you are her parent. You are hurt and disappointed to this day, but you still love her. And you do forgive her. You also accept that this is partly your own fault for having failed to raise her to be a good person.\n\nBut you can't make Joanna forgive her. Sibling's love isn't unconditional like a parent. When you treat people like crap, they don't like it, and then they don't like you. You've talked to Joanna and you don't think she'll ever want a relationship with Allie, which makes perfect sense, since Allie spent years being cruel to her. Of course you want your children to reunite, but you can't control that. Everyone involved is adults who make their own decisions. Allie made the decision to mistreat Johanna for years. Even when Allie was an adult. Just like you couldn't control Allie and make her act with kindness and respect towards Johanna you can't control Johanna and make her over it and suddenly like or love Allie after all these years.\n\nYes, this situation makes you sad. It's one of the many reasons her mother and you told her for years not to act this way. If Allie has really changed, then she should take full responsibility and apologize to Johanna without expecting anything in return (like forgiveness or a wedding invite). That would show she was caring about Johanna's feelings and not just her own. If she did that, you'd feel less disappointed in her and as yourself as a parent.",
