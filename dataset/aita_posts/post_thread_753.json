  "post content": "Am I the Asshole for getting my mentally abusive mother a flask that says f*ck you on it for Christmas??\n\n My mother never wanted kids, and she should have never had kids. She would constantly tell me that children ruin lives. She would always take me places so she could drink and party with friends. She would leave me at home during the summer with only cans of beans in the pantry and wouldn\u2019t let me go to my dads house. She would call me fat, but wouldn\u2019t buy me nutritional snacks because it \u201c wasn\u2019t in the budget\u201d and then go out to concerts, get wasted, and get tattoos. She would constantly say stuff like \u201c oh your cute clothes obviously aren\u2019t comfortable\u201d. When I told her I was depressed and felt like my life wasn\u2019t worth living anymore, she told me to suck it up. She said I was faking it for attention. She would constantly complain about having to take care of me like it was a chore. Keep in mind I\u2019m a 17 year old who doesn\u2019t need someone hovering over them every minute of the day. \n\nWith my mental health destroying my life, I decided to move out and live with my Dad full time. She was obviously hurt, but I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Living with her made me feel like absolute garbage. I tried to see her once a week and be civil, she would always try to guilt me into moving back in by making herself the victim.  On Thanksgiving, she accused me of not loving her in front of our whole entire family and then said \u201c I have all of your shit in boxes, what do you want me to do, throw it away?\u201d in a snarky tone. At this point, I have completely given up on being civil with my mother. I have tried and tried to just have a normal, functioning relationship with her. I wasn\u2019t going to get her anything for Christmas, but I saw a flask that said \u201c f*ck you\u201d on it, and decided that\u2019s what I was gonna get her.  I admit that I did stoop down to her level, but am I the asshole??",
