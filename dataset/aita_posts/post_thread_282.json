  "post content": "I 33M recently got hired at a large company in the south where me and my wife moved months ago.\n\nMy wife was excited for my new job and talked about preparing a surprise for me which got me excited but I didn't what it was til she showed up at my workplace 2 days ago with a meal she said she prepared specifically for me since it's my favorite. Apparently this was her surprise. I was little upset she brought it to my workplace. My co workers who are vicious and brutally honest and sarcastic got involved and kept teasing me about the meal. one of them \"Austin\" joked about how \"mommy\" is so supportive by bringing food to my workplace. I felt like shit as he and other co workers kept laughing at me.\n\nI went to work the next day and Austin\nkept making jokes about me saying shit like \"is mommy going to bring lunch today as well?\" And \"When is mommy coming to change your diaper?\" And some other shit. one of them who's someone I don't know well said \"oh you guys I can still smell the meal (my name's) mom brought yesterday. She's such great cook bless her heart!\" And the goddamned giggles kept on.\n\nI felt so awful I went home and just blew up at my wife telling her she flatout fucking embarrassed me and just torpedoed any goddamned prestige and respect I had among my co workers. I told her what Austin and others have been doing and asked if she was happy for giving him emmo to come at me like that. She argued that she was just trying to do something nice for me and didn't care about what people might say but I was a selfish jerk who only cares about what others think rather than how she felt by my constant berating over a meal she put effort money and time to make and bring to me. The argument escalated after I suggested that she could've waited til I got home to surprise me with this goddamned meal instead of showing up while I was working which made me seem unprofessional. she said she came during lunch break but I was still working during lunch break. She said at this point I clearly find it easier to blame her than stand up for myself against those childish bullies. I said I didn't appreciate what she said but she replied that I should be grateful she cared enough to bring me a home cooked meal then thanked me for showing her it's not worth wasting anymore of her time cooking for me after this. I told her to stop blaming me for something she caused and asked her to admit that maybe she should've consulted me before bringing the meal over so I could avoid being the goddamned butt of every joke my co workers told. I don't even know how long this is going to last. She told me to man up and either report them or quit then. I was floored by what she said I had to walk out becuase I couldn't take anymore of this and felt like she wasn't listening to how her behavior caused me an issue at work.\n\nEdit to say that I in no way don't appreciate my wife's effort but the only problem I have is that she didn't tell me beforehand about wether it was okay to bring the meal over to my workplace. I really prefered that she waited til I got home or we could've gone out later to eat. I agree that the main problem I have is my co workers but I lashed out because I felt overwhelmed with their hurtful remarks that offended my wife as well.",

I was maybe 10-12 years old, and having a hard time with bullies in school, but didn't even hesitate to say something like \"..that's our word for grandfather, and of course I love him, don't you love yours?\" I can't remember 100% of my words, but I 100% remember the look of embarrassment on his face and him saying \"sorry\".\n\nIf people have a hard time standing up for themselves or others, maybe don't think of it as standing up to anyone but just stating a fact: \"of course I love them!\" Or \"they really make me feel special\".  The only time one may need to use caution and not say that is in a dangerous hate situation and their life depends on keeping quiet about it.",

I'm typically mostly aware of his schedule on any given day so I'm good at gauging when it wouldn't be disruptive, and being that he was high in the ranks and a department commander in law enforcement, there were many times we had actual plans which got interrupted and I just quietly made my way out. So reading the OP, I'm thinking, do people think this is stupid? Yikes. I was relieved to see all the YTA comments. Whew!\n\nOP: my husband would NEVER EVER stand for anyone under any circumstance speak negatively of me. If people dared to make fun of him, he'd shrug it off because THEIR OPINIONS DON'T MATTER.

I cannot imagine people would dare to make fun of anything because of my husband's general badassery, so just manning up and commanding respect through your character and how you present yourself could've shut this down.  \n\nIt doesn't bode well for your marriage that you match your wife's kindness and generosity with such immature vitriol and illogical reactiveness. Even in elementary school our daughters knew how to manage bullying; I taught them to do what they aren't expecting. They're expecting to hurt your feelings? Laugh along with them, turn the joke into something neutral, but never be unkind to others, including the bully. The few times my girls had classmates tease them over something, my girls shut it down in short order--they didn't ignore it, because we know that 'just ignore them' doesn't work, but they proactively and positively turned the situation around (not to say they weren't hurt--they were--but the bullies don't need to know that). \n\nYour wife sounds delightful and from just what you've written, she's very intelligent and perceptive.
