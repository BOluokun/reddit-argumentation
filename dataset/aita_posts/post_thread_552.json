My father in law (who does not live with us) got a very large free Turkey and decided to that he will be cooking the Turkey for our gathering. I work full time and have a toddler so I am grateful for this.  And while I think this is a nice gesture on his part, I am a little worried because he wants to cook the Turkey the day before Thanksgiving (to get it out of the way), and then reheat it in the oven Thanksgiving day. He can cook but does not salt his food very much. This is an incredibly nice thing of him to do for us but I feel slightly insulted as the hostess that he didn't even ask if I was ok with it. But then again  I also FEEL like an a-hole because it will take a great burden/stress off of me to not have to deal with the Turkey and only the sides. I am trying to persuade my husband to get FIL to cook the bird on actual a Thanksgiving (we are eating in the evening so he has a lot of time to do so) but he's pretty set in his ways about it... \n\nAm I the a-hole here?",

No loss of quality. \n\nYou need to talk to him about seasoning or recipe.  Not a big deal.
