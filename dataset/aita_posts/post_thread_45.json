  "post content": "I (57M) own a small business. There\u2019s only about 20 employees that work for me but recently I hired someone new. She seemed like a great fit at first but she\u2019s started stirring up trouble mainly with one of my hardest working employees. I didn\u2019t know this but apparently he has an only fans. The new employee came to my office one day holding a folder, keep in mind she\u2019s been here for less then a month. \n\nShe dropped the folder on my desk and opened it up. She went into a spiel showing several pictures of him and other men doing things you\u2019d expect to see on a porn account. She started talking about how inappropriate and disgusting it was for him to be doing things like this. I felt like this was especially dumb because she was looking at porn and wanted to degrade people making it? \n\nShe said he was putting out a horrible representation of our company. I really felt like this wasn\u2019t fair cause it\u2019s entirely up to him what he wants to do outside of work and I don\u2019t control his body. She just got a lot angrier and started demanding me to fire him. I told her to just shut up and get out(probably what\u2019s making me wrong here) She went out and told everyone else and now they\u2019re demanding me to fire him too. I\u2019d get it if we were watching children or something similar but we literally just make drawings for games. \n\nSo am I the a-hole for not firing him? Was I in the wrong here?\n\nI posted the update to my profile so everyone can see it",

To my knowledge, it is also against OF rules to print pictures of the content, and it is definitely revenge porn for her to give those photos to you and others without his consent. Good for you for not firing him, and I would personally choose to fire her. She's toxic\n\nEdit: Wow!! Thanks so much for the awards, they're the first I've ever gotten!! I left for a wedding and didn't expect this post to blow up, much less for my comment to be at the top. Thanks to y'all and good luck to OP with damage control.",

So, for example, even if a grocery store is a \"union shop\", if hired, you can opt not to join the union. In non-\"Right to Work\" states, in a unionized store, membership can be a requirement for employment. 27 US states are currently \"Right to Work\" states.\n\n\"At-Will Employment\" - in essence, this means that either party (employer and employee) can end the working relationship at any time (i.e. at will), without cause. For employers, this means they can terminate an employee for any reason that is not a protected basis. 49 US states are \"at-will\" (Montana being the exception), but some do place certain restrictions on it.\n\nHope that helps.",

Tell him you're handling it, and if anyone harasses him about it to report it to you. \n\nI'd then talk to her, and explain (don't let her argue or respond, just explain) the following- you are the one who determines who is employed, not her. It is not an issue what he does on his personal  time, and he's not involving the company by doing it. If you're firing her, frankly I'd say that the reason is sexual harassment (because she brought his nudes in to the office, shared them with at least you, and shared his personal sexual activities with other employees creating an unsafe work environment for him, although you may want to check with a lawyer to get the best wording on this), and aside from that, its a job requirement to be professional, respect your coworkers and not disrupt regular business operations (and she is doing that by her actions). There's an argument for not firing her if she's a good performer so far, however I'd lean toward firing her if she's new because this shows absolutely terrible judgment. \n\nNot only that, but I'd fight against her unemployment as this could qualify as \"gross misconduct\", which is a disqualifier for unemployment in my worker-friendly state. Seeking out a coworker's explicit photos, bringing them in to the office, and sharing them/their existence with anyone is something that everyone should know not to do and is, in my mind, an example of gross misconduct in any field other than porn production (and even then, most of the time its still unacceptable).",
