  "post content": "I have been dating \"Elle\" for just under 10 months. Truly amazing relationship and I've fallen for her hard. I guess we've never formally talked about being exclusive (I honestly had to think back) but she always says things like \"when we get married...\" and \"our kids will be geniuses!\" that I think are sweet and I thought were a sign of us being in a committed/exclusive relationship. \n\nThe other night I went out to dinner with friends to a really cool bar/restaurant. I could see Elle inside but I don't think she could see me. She was with another guy. I know that she comes from a family where she has something like 42 cousins, all of whom live locally and she says she hangs out with them all the time. And the guy had more than a passing resemblance to her so I figured that must be the answer. I had planned on going over and saying hi when a lull happened at our table but in that time I saw the dude like pin her wrist to the table with his hand and she was trying to pull it away. Then he tried to really forcefully grab her behind the neck and pull her in for a kiss. I lost my shit and went charging inside and sort of grabbed the guys wrist and arm and told him to leave her the fuck alone. \n\nElle screamed something like holy shit what the fuck are you doing? I was like I'm helping you! She said she was just flirting with him and they were there together. At that point I was like what in the fuck are you talking about? We're dating! She said that yes we are dating but she's still dating other people. I was so freaking embarrassed because the entire restaurant was staring at us and I wanted to crawl into a hole and die. I left without paying the bill (I sent my friends money on apple pay so I didn't stiff anyone) and got an uber and went home and figured that was that and figured I'd never see her again. \n\nWell I had tickets to the Sharks game and Elle was supposed to go with me but I just wanted to wallow in self pity. But sure enough the showed up at the exact time we agreed decked out in blue and black complete with her shark pasties so she could flash the camera. She basically just said \"hey I need you to know I really like you but I'm still seeing other people\" I asked her I thought we were exclusive. She said if she choses me to be exclusive, I'll know it but I acted like a real asshole at the restaurant the previous night. I asked her what the deal with the grabbing was she said that was she and Ken's \"love language\" (great I know another guys name). She asked if I could be cool, so I said yes. The game was fun and she acted is if nothing whatsoever happened and was like the same, super cool, fun, loving girl she always had been. I felt like there was a 2000lb weight on my back. \n\nto help me find some clarity was I the asshole for assuming we were exlusive? Was I the asshole for how I acted at the restaurant?",

To me, (and I am willing to admit I could be wrong) this is usually why you are seeing multiple people: you\u2019re not ready to settle down with one just yet.

I think after 10 months there's a reasonable expectation of exclusivity and it does sound like (at least how you describe) the other guys' actions could be interpreted in a very shady light. \nI guess the question is after finding this out, why stay with her? I get that it's cute she says all the stuff about your future which is apparently her love language with you, but now you know that she has \"love languages\" with at least one other person. I don't think she did anything wrong but it's certainly something you don't have to put up with.",

And so if you assume that and you thought a guy was trying to molest her then yeah I get trying to protect her. I mean I never have had an \"exclusive\" talk it always was a given after a few months especially if kids and marriage are being discussed. I know you are going to get a lot of \"communication\" comments, but c'mon who wouldn't think it was exclusive.\n\nEdit: typo",
