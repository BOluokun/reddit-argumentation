  "post content": "Hi I (36f) have a brother (34m) who is getting married to his girlfriend now fianc\u00e9. They are planning a for next summer once hopefully the pandemic is over. They are planning to have a child free wedding and while I don\u2019t object to that (it\u2019s their wedding they get to do whatever makes them happy) I informed them that I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend due to my kids (8 month and 4 year old).  My brother got kind of defensive and said I couldn\u2019t just t get a babysitter. I tried to explain that I already work a demanding job and feel like I miss out a lot on my kids life\u2019s and it doesn\u2019t seem fair for me to got on 3 day vacation without them. My brother then went on to say this is why he is never having children because they make you unreliable and I got kinda defensive about comment. So I ended the conversation there. I understand why my brother would want me at his wedding, we don\u2019t have a huge family and our father passed away when I was 18 and he was 16. I get that but also have this commitment to my kids that I feel like I sometimes fail because I chose to have a more difficult job.So aita\n\nEdit:  So I think there is some confusion. I work a lot like my job is up to 45-50 hours weeks. I chose my profession, and it does make a relatively good income but in the Bay Area that just means middle class but I could get a sitter I\u2019m just not really comfortable with that. I work the whole week because my jobs doesn\u2019t really have a set schedule. I don\u2019t get to spend as much time with my kids as I like and that\u2019s on me but I can\u2019t justify (to myself) to not prioritize them. My brother and I have an okay relationship we used to be closer but grew apart once I got married and had my own family. My extended family doesn\u2019t see a problem with me not attending the wedding as long as I send a gift and I already planned on doing that.\n\nUpdate: so I ended up talking to my brother again on a shared video call with our mother. Mom staying out of this and staying neutral ( I get that we both kind of suck). I explained the guilt I feel and my brother said he kind of has resented and dislikes my children for a long time  and I don\u2019t know how I exactly feel about that. I asked why and he said they just made us grow apart faster. He started talking about how after I started graduate school I changed and he felt left out. I guess it had been building up for a decade. I think I want a relationship with my brother so I hoping we talk this out more but he said some things that me put in a weird position. I\u2019m going to try to have a walk in the park with him this week so that we can safely see each other and maybe work it out.",

You also don't need to not take them and miss 3 whole days. You can take them and arrange for child care at the hotel. You will be away from them for the rehearsal dinner, which would mostly be when they are asleep, and for the wedding itself, which is what, 7 or 8 hours at most including the reception?\n\nNow, if the real issue is that you don't think you can afford the trip or afford hiring a sitter, that is a different matter. But if it is just about feeling bad that you miss a weekend with your kids, you need to examine your priorities a bit.",
