  "post content": "I (25F) lived with my parents (50F and 55M) because it is very close to my service and it is a very expensive area.\n\n I can currently live alone, but I didn't because I never needed it and my parents didn't ask. \n\nAs time went on and I earned more, I put in air conditioning, made my room smart, as well as the house (Alexa), put a very good shower in the guest bathroom (which I eventually added to my bedroom) I bought quality furniture to my room etc. My room turned out to be the best in the house because of the changes I made. \n\nAnd yes, I paid rent to my parents (quite fat by the way). \n\nIt's been 3 months since they came to talk to me, saying it was time for me to change, because they wanted to have their moment alone now and I was able to live on my own. I agreed, after all I was just living there for ease and convenience. \n\nI found a house and I would need to make all the changes I planned, so in order not to have to buy it when I have it, I replaced all the sockets/bulbs/switches (smart) and the shower with common ones (I paid for them all and this increase in energy I paid too). I also removed the air conditioner and paid to plug the hole it leaves. Besides of course all the furniture in my room and Alexas scattered around the house. \n\nMy parents started complaining that I shouldn't take everything out, as they were in common use. They were planning to move his room to mine and that with these changes I made my room worse and the house in general too (it's just not smart, everything I bought was quality). \n\nI said that they asked me to move and I'm taking everything I bought, because I needed to have other expenses (I made a payment on the house) and these items were all bought by me and all the increase in energy I had was paid only by me too. And that if they wanted to buy, I can help search online, but I would take these items. \n\nThey called me selfish, because I made the house worse and removed the items in common use, as they were already used to the smart home. They complained even more when I didn't want to leave the 65' Smart TV in my room as a gift for them (I didn't leave it because it's new and it was too expensive). \n\nI moved a week ago, but they're still upset. \n\nAll items are brand new (most less than 1 year old) \n\nAdd: Yes it was cheaper for me to replace. Legally I can do this. It's not US, these things are very expensive in my country\n\nAITA?\n\n*Extra:  No replaced item made them lose money, all were replaced by the same (before smart) or better. It's because the Smart is twice the price of normal items  so obviously it's of a \"lesser\" quality compared to smart things.*\n\nExtra: About AC, I didn't put it in the text, they complained the least, because they don't use it, I took it mainly because it would gather dust in my parents' house.",

My parents even insisted on me taking a few pieces of furniture from the house so I wouldn't have to buy it all or do without.
