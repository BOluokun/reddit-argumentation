  "post content": "GF and I were having dinner at a restaurant when she got a text from her best friend (who recently gave birth), and she said \"omg she got a C section.\" she works as a nurse so she then explained to me the type of incision they make for that and how it'll leave a scar. I then, as a joke, said \"at least she'll still be tight down there.\" My GF looked confused and then said that was a weird comment to make about her friend. I then said it is a very normal joke to make and she disagreed. TLDR there was some back and forth, i asked her to drop it and she kept trying to talk about it. I said to her \"youre so insecure\" and she then goes \"does it make you feel good to call me that?\" so then I got really frustrated, got up, and walked out of the restaurant and drove home. She called me several times (I drove both of us there) but I was so frustrated and just wanted to get home so I turned my phone off. She showed up at our apartment 30min later and was really pissed called me an asshole and over reacted, and that she waited in the cold for 20 min for an uber. Am i the asshole for walking out on her and leaving her there for being frustated?",
