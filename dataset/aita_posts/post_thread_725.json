  "post content": "**warning...warning...** THIS IS NOT A VALIDATION POST. I KNOW WHO I AM. I do not need validation from strangers. I want to know if I SHOULD have done something different and as such IF I should do something different the next time this type of thing comes up. \n\n**preface:**\n\nSome background is in order. I am one of four sisters. I am the second oldest. I have always been a bit a black sheep in that my genetics take after my mom's side of the family and I am much heavier than my sisters who are all spectacularly gorgeous, thin and athletic. I am \"pretty\" but I also weight 250lbs (which I was ashamed of for a long time, now I try to accept who I am which is why I don't mind saying it here). \n\nEarlier in the year my dad mad a huge amount of money from selling some stock options at his work. His dream has always been taking a huge family vacation so my parents, myself, two of my sisters and their spouses and kids (all under 10) with my other single sister rounding it out are all on the trip. We were at an absolutely gorgeous beach resort for Christmas. \n\nI decided since I've accepted my weight as it is, I was also going to not be ashamed and \"cover up\" like I used to. In fact, I figured \"screw it, I'm 28 and was going to catch me a hot foreign dude on the trip. I'm showing some skin!\" So I got three new swimsuits, one is a full on thong one piece, the other two are very \"cheeky\" bikinis. \n\n**the incident:**\n\nMaybe four days in I finally felt confident enough to wear the one piece without a sarong. when I got down to the beach with the rest of the family I took off my robe and laid down, first on my back. I could see my older sister just staring daggers at me and when I turned over to get some sun on my bum, she said something like \"seriously Janey? There's kids here!\" I asked her what she was talking about and she said that it was totally inappropriate that my ass was \"hanging out.\" I told her I didn't appreciate her comment. She said she didn't appreciate me embarrassing her. I told her to take a look at our youngest sister (who is 19) and she was literally wearing a string bikini with mere inches of fabric that showed more of her ass than mine. \n\nMy oldest sister then told me that if I didn't understand the difference than there was something wrong with me. I asked her if it was because I was fat? She told me something really rude like \"Janey this is why we don't have a relationship, you make everything fucking difficult.\" She then packed up her husband and kids and left the beach and I didn't see them until dinner that night. \n\n**The fallout:** \n\nMy oldest sister didn't say a friendly word to me the entire rest of the trip. She has some wicked mean girl abilities and because of her I was pretty much isolated from my family from the rest of the trip. I did get to go to a few dinners but no one would tell me when they were going to the beach so for the rest of the trip I didn't see get to see or play with my nieces and nephews on the beach. It sucked and made me feel really sad, neglected and even guilty for standing my ground. \n\nWe all independently flew home and I have gotten emails from my oldest sister, my mom and my dad all saying that \"your clothing choices essentially ruined a family vacation and we are so disappointed.\" Just on a lark I called my youngest sister and said something like \"hey sis, crazy how our family is freaking out about thong swimwear, even though its the style everywhere now...huh!?\" she responded with \"what are you talking about? no one is freaking out about my swimwear.\"  So yeah...they are again freaking out because I'm a bigger girl. Skinny girls can show their ass, fat girls can't. \n\nWell to top all of this off, I just found out that my two sisters with kids are planning on meeting up in Destin for Spring Break because their kids had so much fun on the beach with each other. The trip has been mentioned to my younger sister, I don't think she's technically invited but I'm sure they wouldn't say no if she wanted to go. Guess who hasn't had the trip mentioned to them...even though I spoke with my other middle sister. Yup. \n\nSo did I cause all these by being the asshole by wearing the swimsuit of my choice? Or is this my family being shitty to me?\n\nAITA?\n",

I have seen just so, so many people skinny dipping (i paddle competitively and spend a lot of time on the river) in just about any body of water here, and we have a nude beach (maybe two?) within city limits. It's weird to see naked people but string bikinis won't raise any eyebrows. I see it a lot like men's athletic suits (interestingly, women's athletic suits are far more modest whereas men's athletic suits are dick-huggers). It leaves very little to the imagination, but it's contextually okay.\n\nAmerica is kind of unique for western countries with our \"hide your shame!\" culture around nudity. OP mentioning bagging a foreign guy makes me wonder if it was more appropriate in that setting than it would be in your average American beach. ",
