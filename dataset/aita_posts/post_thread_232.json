It will be around 100-150 people total. My husband and I are paying for this all ourselves, as well as my grandma who said she doesn't care one way or the other on this issue. She just loves weddings.\n\nWe have a lot of kids in our family so we decided against making it child-free but we did decide to make it dry. So there will be no alcohol of any kind at our wedding. Honestly, this doesn't have anything to do with there being kids there but due to the fact that my fianc\u00e9 and I don't drink. Nothing against people who do, it's just not for us and we don't want to. On top of that, we only really drink water. We rarely, if ever, drink soda so most of the time it's only water with the occasional juice and milk. We don't even drink coffee. \n\nSo obviously the food (which is a part my grandma is not paying for) is going to be expensive for that many people. We are having our wedding catered so everyone will have a good choice of food to choose from but to drink only water will be provided. We don't want to have to pay for alcohol or soda, it is just an large added expense when we can just do filtered water for a MUCH cheaper cost.\n\nWell, when family and friends found out being got angry. Some didn't really care but some are really upset about it. Saying that I can just have an open bar so I don't have to pay for drinks (we could, but still have to pay for the bartender and we just really don't want to bother with alcohol there). Or we should at least have soda because how can we expect everyone to drink ONLY water? The kids will be upset. The wedding will be boring. That this is not how weddings work. Etc.\n\nSo AITA? I didn't think this would be a problem! It's only water. I mean, don't most people drink water everyday anyway? Should we pay the extra to have soda to make the family happy?",

      "content": "I know that technically you could be in the right, but here\u2019s the thing about weddings, the marriage ceremony is for you and your fianc\u00e9. The wedding is for everyone you\u2019ve invited, it\u2019s an event you\u2019re hosting, and not providing any drinks other than water makes you a bad host/hostess. \n\nI\u2019ve been to dry weddings. There was a couple that put real thought and effort into designing mocktails themed around their relationship. It was delightful and everyone connected to the couple through it. Another couple had a sparkling cider tower in place of champagne and everyone cheered with cider in flutes. \n\nWhen you\u2019re hosting an event, your job as hostess is to take care of your guests. Just because it follows a marriage ceremony doesn\u2019t make you any less the host of an event. And that means providing more than one drink option, especially non alcoholic. Especially to an event your guests are incurring expenses to attend and bringing gifts to. \n\nYTA honestly. I fully support a dry wedding but only water as a beverage is being a cheap host.",

And the bigger events mentioned here are still on a scale where home can be the venue. When you need to rent a room it's water on every table, an assortment of sodas and juices, maybe alcohol (went to a dry funeral but most such events have at least beer and wine) though while that's socially expected I don't mind dry events, I usually abstain from alcohol anyways due to driving and rarely drink at home and after the meal and/or with cake coffee is served.",

We chose a few wines to pair with dinner and had a cash option if people wanted more than one cocktail. Granted we kept it under 50 people, but it felt weird to ask others to not drink. So we compromised on a less expensive option that didn\u2019t sacrifice enjoyment for others.",

(A tea or coffee in the morning.  Occasional wine or beer.  But soda only if I'm eating out, or doing take-out.)  I also have a lot of friends and work colleagues who, even if we go out to dinner, choose to stick with ice water for the meal, and not because of expense.  So I'm fine with \"we mostly drink just water\", that's me too.  I don't regard it a symptom of self-denial or anything, and it's often not really about spending, either.\n\nWhen you're putting on a wedding, of course there is a lot of room for \"this is our party and here is how we want it\".  Childfree wedding?  Fine.  Dry wedding?  Fine.  \n\nBut I have to agree with others here who say that just because the bride and groom don't want anything else to drink but water, you'd kind of being bad hosts by allowing the guests no other drink choices.  \n\nWe could get into a long discussion about how people should be able to attend a party that doesn't have alcohol, it's one party, etc., but why doesn't that apply to other drinks?

Unlike the rest of the family, she and her husband aren\u2019t big drinkers, but she made sure to purchase quite a large variety of alcohol and mixers. We drank wine out of red solos. It was nowhere near a \u2018traditional\u2019 wedding, but it was a lot of fun since it was low key and made it easier to interact.

Disappointing only because one of the grooms has an Indian mother and an Italian father, and I was secretly hoping a gay Indian-Italian wedding was going to be the most extra.\n* The one that was noticeably underattended because the groom was the one with the big family, and his hometown flooded two days before the wedding, so half of them couldn't make it.

Him and his wife drank occasionally but his church (who was pretty anti alcohol), were officiating the wedding so it was alcohol free. There was about 500 people at this event and plenty of non alcoholic options however. Me and my bf at the time went out for a cheeky cigarette and there were about 30 odd people coming and going in taxis to the off license to get booze and my uncle was basically running a free bar from the back of his car with plastic cups. My nephew found out and just thought it was funny but like, a lot of us had travelled a long way for this event (including abroad) and taken holidays so people wanted to party! Adults are gonna adult you know.",
