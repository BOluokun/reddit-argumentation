  "post content": "I'm a working student (27/M). I combine working FT with getting a uni-degree.\n\nA lot of my free time is consumed by going to classes and studying. I always have to find the right balance between time spend on working/studying and time spend with loved ones, most importantly my gf (26), who I have been living with for 2 years now in our small one bedroom apartment.\n\nMy gf has a hard time accepting I can't always spend as much time with her as she would like.\n\nSo in the beginning of this year I started getting up early (6 am) to be able to study for about 1h before having to go to work. This quickly became untenable for two reasons:\n\n1.\tMy gf is a big 'revenge bedtime procrastinator'. Which basically comes down to her wanting to stay up late during the week (until about 1am).\n\n2.\tI have sleeping issues. I have difficulties falling and staying asleep. This causes me to be unable to sleep before she's in the bed beside me. This sucks but I really can't help it. I just know that if I fall asleep, I'll wake right up the moment she enters the bedroom and then I won't be able to sleep for hours.\n\nGoing to bed at 1 AM and waking up at 6 AM results in about 5h of sleep. Exhausting and just plain unhealthy.\n\nA few weeks ago, I changed course and stopped the early morning studying. To compensate for that, I started studying at least one day of the weekend.\n\nThe first time I did this, I hadn't talked this through with my gf and she became upset when the weekend came and I told her I would be studying the entire day. So at that point I promised her I'd be more clear towards her about which day of the weekend would be spent on studying.\n\nLast week I told her I\u2019d be studying on Sunday. She's cool with that. Then Sunday comes along and she starts asking me if I want to go to the park with her. At first I refuse but then she starts getting really upset and tearing up. I felt like a dick.\n\nSo I came up with the following deal. I\u2019d stop studying, spend the day with her and spend more time with her during weekends. From her side, she had to promise me that we\u2019d be going to bed earlier, so that I could start studying in the mornings again. My deal included going to bed at 11 PM.\n\nShe agreed.\n\nWe spent the rest of Sunday together. Because I didn't have to work on Monday we didn't go to sleep at 11 PM that day.\n\nBut then Monday night (yesterday) came along. At 9:30 PM she wants to put on a movie and I tell her \"fine, but you remember our deal right? We'll probably not be able to finish this movie if we want to go to bed at 11 PM...\" She puts on the movie anyway.\n\nWhen the clock reaches 11 PM we get into a huge fight. She starts complaining about the fact that I'm \"treating her like a child\", that she's a grown up who can go to bed whenever she wants, that I'm being super unreasonable, that she never thought I would actually ask for her to go to bed at 11 PM. I feel cheated.\n\nThis argument is still going. AITA?",

A bed time? Really? \n\nStop putting your sleep issues on her. She has sleep issues too where she can't sleep until later and thay suits her. She shouldn't lay in bed wide awake to appease you. Get some ear plugs, a white noise machine, melatonin, weighted blanket, or separate bedrooms. It's not her responsibility to make your sleep better as she's not purposely sabtogage it. She simply has a different sleep schedule.\n\nShe however needs to stop saying yes when she means no just to get what she wants in the moment. That's straight up bs.\n\nThe studying schooling is temporary and I may have missed where you said how much longer this will continue for? \n\nPerhaps you need to rethink your quality time evaluate when you you make the effort for some real quality time. A bigger dinner and date night every week or 2. A daily 1 minute hug. Coffee together uninterrupted. Cooking together. Put on song and invite her to dance with you, then go back to studying - small doses of connection. It's not sexy to schedule it in, but plan it be intentional, and be aware of all the times you turn her down vs tell her yes.",

Be that on weekend studying, or sleeping 2 hours earlier. It also comes to respect when going to bed earlier when your partner has to wake up early. My boyfriend gets up at 5am when he works. I usually stay up until 1am. But because I know getting into bed and bed time rituals aren\u2019t a quiet thing, I also get into bed at the time he does. Because I\u2019m respecting his sleep schedule and I\u2019m respecting his needs. He does the same for me. \n\nA relationship is a compromise and believe it or not, that includes when it comes to sleeping. It\u2019s respect for your partner and their needs. Basic shit",

She's an adult, but she's an irresponsible and childish adult. You have no power here. She likely will not go to bed early enough for you to study. \n\nHowever, she didn't uphold a bargain.

I have a very demanding job, and specialty exams at the moment and literally all of my free time is spent trying to hold my relationship together.\n\nI also have the same sleeping issues, like when my othe half first moved in I would literally jump out of the bed in shock everytime he came to bed as he stays up far later than me.\n\nI can see youe point and understand it because you're compromising already and you're trying your hardest to make this work. Your girlfriend seems like she doesn't understand the time and emotional pressures of everything you have on and is missing the time you used to be able to spend together. And honestly, I don't have the answer. My partner and I actually started on a break 2 days ago because of this exact thing. \n\nWith the sleeping thing, I'm sorry but I think it's unreasonable to make someone go to bed at the same time as you. I ended up buying sleeping headphones and the shock factor got better the move I got used to it and over a few months 8 barely noticed anymore. But, I also think she handled this really poorly, you had a deal and a compromise and she didn't stick to that. Albeit because she wants to spend more time with you, she's also not treating you like an adult and respecting your boundaries. \n\nI hope you work out a solution (please tell me what it is if you do \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d)",
