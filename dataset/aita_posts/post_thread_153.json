  "post content": "Pretty straightforward I got a lock for my four year olds room. My son is only four but he\u2019s super in the collecting things. (He has autism) He has probably every single monster jam monster truck ever made, he has every single marvel/DC/superhero action figure you could think of, and he\u2019s really into setting up these huge marble runs. Everything is organized and put away nicely and my son likes to keep it that way. \n\nThe problem is that every time my best friends kids or my nephew comes over, they b-line it to his room and trash everything. Literally from ripping off legs to The action figures, ripping off tires to his monster trucks and just trashing every single toy that they can get their hands on in general. I\u2019m not even talking about just normal wear and tear these kids are fucking like destructive and they will destroy almost everything they put their hands on. \n\nThe marbles end up all over my house and lost. He also has a collection of those squishy toys and one of the kids literally will not keep their hands off of them and bites a hole in one every single time, ruining it. I used to go through his room and have to hide everything before they came over to try to avoid this but I have literally had it at this point so I told them they are no longer allowed in my sons room period. \n\nThey can play with the huge bin of toys that I have in the living room or one of the 100\u2019s of toys outside ect. Of course it didn\u2019t go over well and the kids started throwing a fit because they know what\u2019s in his room and the toys \u201caren\u2019t good enough and they\u2019re bored\u201d. and my sister and best friend are both saying that I\u2019m being too much and saying that they\u2019re just toys. But these toys are expensive, we spent hours building the marble run just for it to get torn down the absolute second they walk in the door. \n\nAnd after everyone\u2019s gone and the room is trashed and all his toys are broken and misplaced he\u2019s really upset over it. Rightfully IMO. They say I am teaching him not to share and to be greedy but I disagree. I think they need to teach their kids basic respect for other people stuff and to not throw a fit when they can\u2019t have something. I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with them going in there and playing with the stuff if they were even the least bit respectful about it but proven time and time again that they can\u2019t handle it. \n\nNow they don\u2019t want to come over with their kids because they think I\u2019m being an asshole and I honestly don\u2019t care. I also believe that you should teach your kids to share but not everything HAS to be shared you can have specific things to just keep for yourself. I\u2019m just curious as to what everyone else thinks am I the asshole or no??\n\n(Edit to add spacing)\n\nEdit UPDATE:\n\nI\u2019m just not gonna have them over anymore. I explain to them what everyone is saying in the comments and while they agreed, nothing will ever change. (With my best friend, my sister is 100% on board) \nThey came over (besties kids) two times since the incident and now that they\u2019re not allowed in the room they just find other shit to get into in the house.  Next best thing to get into this time it was the pantry. \n\n\nI just come to realize that these kids are monsters it doesn\u2019t matter what situation they\u2019re put in they will find away to be horrible. Everything they do is because she allows it at her own home. Claims she doesn\u2019t but the kids wouldn\u2019t act like that if she were telling the truth. I don\u2019t want to ruin my 15 year friendship because I do love my best friend I just hate her kids so I don\u2019t know what to do. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\n\nUPDATE: I haven\u2019t spoken to said bestie since November. Sucks a 15 year friendship ended but my life has never been more peaceful. My nephew is a lot better as well!",
