  "post content": "My uncle had a beautiful little girl 3 years ago, and both my uncle and aunt are still heads over heels about her.\n\nProblem is, they suck at parenting and won\u2019t let anyone tell them that they\u2019re wrong.\n\nFor starters, they\u2019re anti-vaxxers, and have refused to give her any shots; where I live, they\u2019re mandated by law and kids cannot legally attend school without a vaccination certificate, but they\u2019re homeschooling her. Loophole, I guess.\n\nSecondly, her daughter has a horrible behavior, screaming, talking over adults, throwing tantrums and constantly touching fragile objects even when repeatedly telling her not to.\n\nThe event that broke the camel\u2019s back was this:\nOne night, we were having a family gathering at my house, and while my mom was praying (she\u2019s very catholic) the kid farted really loudly.\n\nHer parents just laughed, and carried on like if nothing had happened.\n\nAfter this, I don\u2019t want her in my house anymore ever again, and I will let her parents know that she is not invited anymore, I don\u2019t care if it ruins my relationship with them at this point.\n\nMy mom doesn\u2019t want to do this, as she wants to keep our family very close (she\u2019s very traditional)\n\nWIBTA if I went against her wishes, and told them that she\u2019s not welcome here anymore?\n\nEdit: since so many people are asking why the farting ticked me off so much; it wasn\u2019t the farting itself, kids do that.\n\nWhat annoys me is the fact that they refuse to teach her why that is not okay, and don\u2019t make any effort to fix this behavior, in fact, they seem to encourage it with laughter, and this applies to many other things.\n\nWhen she has a tantrum they generally stick an IPad in front of her, and she calms down momentarily, but misbehaves shortly again.\n\nEdit#2: I should mention that she starts screaming, yelling, and sometimes crying when no one is paying attention to her. I mean, whenever her parents aren\u2019t focused on her, she starts yelling, whenever she\u2019s doing something and people aren\u2019t watching her, she yells and cries, it just keeps happening and her parents don\u2019t even try to do anything.\n\nEdit#3: I just realized I should mention that I\u2019m from Ecuador, and culture here is different. Farting is disrespectful in our culture, and we should at least say sorry when it happens. Kids are expected to be well behaved, and this is the case the majority of times.\n\nEdit#4: I shouldn\u2019t have said \u201cever again\u201d in the title, that\u2019s not what I meant, I was annoyed and made a mistake, sorry.\n\nEdit#5: I refer to her as my niece Bc my uncle is my cousin, he\u2019s older than me and he has a kid, so I refer to him as uncle and to her daughter as niece.\n\n*update*\n\nTalked with my mom, she agreed that the kid was making many guests uncomfortable, and we decided to tell her parents that until her behavior improves, she won\u2019t be invited here anymore.\n\nOf course, they\u2019re mad at us, but we have considered the pros and cons, and we have decided to take this course of action.\n\nThanks for all that replied to this post",

With my first child, I tried everything to control her when she was 2-3 -- positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement... Any attempt to control her just made things worse.  It turns out, she just needed to get a bit older.. around 4 or so she started understanding things like causality, right/wrong, and consequences.\n\nI'm not sure what about her behavior is unacceptable in your household... If you just \"don't like it,\" I would suggest maybe just being more patient and understanding.  Spend some time with the niece... Try to entertain her with some toys and understand how she works.\n\nIf you're worried about her safety or your property, that's a legitimate concern.  Just tell the parents you don't think your home is childproof enough and suggest some other places to meet up with them.  No need to call it a \"ban\"... More like a safety measure.",

Later on he edited in that the parents don't try to do anything, but that kind of contradicts the \"even when told repeatedly not to,\" so I'm not sure what to think.\n\nI'll add that I do think the parents are assholes for not vaccinating their kid, but that is not really the issue here from what I can tell, and I'm not sure why he mentioned it, except to try to stack judgments in his favor.",

I would say banning them is a step too dramatic right now but pointing out how her behavior is wildly out of the realm of acceptable and they are making no efforts to teach her otherwise will lead to them not being allowed in your home. While I'm not religious myself, I recognize that praying is a deeply personal thing to be respected. Parents need to be teaching the kid that 2 minutes of her not being the center of attention is ok, and she needs to be respectful of others. 3 year olds are very intelligent and can be reasoned with, and their methods of coddling her and just sticking an iPad in front of her face are setting her up for failure for dealing with her own feelings, and an escalation of behavioral issues later on that will be progressively harder and harder to deal with. They need to be snapped back to reality, and if they refuse to parent their child THEN let them know they are jo longer welcome.",
