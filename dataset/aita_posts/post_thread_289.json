  "post content": "My son is 8 years old and recently attended his friend's 8th birthday party. This friend is my best friend's son. I don't let my son have any/much junk food at all and usually he brings his own snacks (for this incident it was carrot sticks and ranch) to events that have a lot of sugary foods.\n\nMy best friend bakes a lot, and made a special chocolate cake for her son's birthday. When it comes to my son, I don't let him have cake. This is personal preference for his health, not for any allergy reasons, and he is not diabetic or gluten free. My son knows he isn't allowed to have cake because of the additives. When he told his best friend this at the party, his friend apparently got upset and told him it was \"good cake\", not bad like I say, because his mom made it, and it was his birthday cake. My son ate cake, got a sugar rush, and crashed, making him cranky for the rest of the day after we left the party. \n\nI told my friend she needs to have some kind of consequences for her son to teach him not to peer pressure other children into eating things they're not allowed to have. She said because it wasn't an issue of allergies or health, that she's sorry my son was cranky but she won't be punishing her son or talking to him about it on his birthday. She says also that she'll just that she'll watch more closely/make sure her husband does in the future, as well as have a chat with him on another day about respecting food habits. (I love my friend, but historically, her and her husband have always said 'yes' to their son and not given him any consequences for anything.)\n\nBoth of us were present at the party and did not see them sharing the cake (they were outside eating in the backyard with their fathers and some other parents supervising while we cleaned up) so it's not an issue of anyone going behind anyone's back, just teaching children boundaries and respect. \n\nI let my son stay for the rest of the party and be with his friend, so it's not like I ruined the day. \n\nAITA for being upset with my friend's son and the fact that she won't punish her son for pressuring my son into eating cake?",

They have been debunked many many many times by scientists and medical professionals.\n\nThat your son was irritable for the rest of the day was likely because, having had fun at a friend's birthday party, you pissed all over his enjoyment of the party with your ridiculous attitude and over-the-top indictment of the whole party.  I can only imagine your son's embarassment at you having the utter gall to  demand consequences for a kid, on his birthday, who shared his cake with your son (who, by your own admission has NO health issues that would be affected by said cake).    It wasn't the cake that made your son irritable, it was YOU.\n\nI seriously doubt that you being declared the asshole in this will in any way soften your views on such things.\n\nIts perfectly fine to want to make sure that your kids eat nutritiously.  You also shouldn't be a fascist about it.  In fact, the more you try to exert such iron control over it, the higher the likelyhood you will drive your son straight into an eating disorder.   There isn't a doubt in  my mind that your son has a stash of candy at various places.  Because of YOU.\n\n(edit - thank you all very much for the awards!)",

Which,  looking at it now, was detrimental to both my physical and mental health.\n\nSo yeah. OP, YTA. Stop this now before you lose your son.\n\nWhy are you so worried about ONE piece of cake? It's a homemade cake (so no additives) and there are no other health reasons for eating a little cake for affect his health. Yes, eating a lot of sugar and fat leads to health issues, but this was *a single piece* of cake on his friend's special day. I understand your concerns about nutritious food, but it seems like you're being a dictator about it.\n\n[Sugar crashes are a myth.](https://www.goodrx.com/well-being/diet-nutrition/are-sugar-high-sugar-crash-real)\n\nHere's the thing - it was never about being able to eat cake. It was so much more than that - having ALL your food controlled to the slightest bit, missing out on a central part of birthday fun every year, and now being stripped of that joy and normalcy the moment he let himself enjoy it. Which is exactly why you DID ruin the day for him.\n\nYou know what? This is the most likely path to eating disorders you could've chosen for your son. From personal experience, making ANY food 100% off-limits will only lead to an unhealthy relationship with that food and food in general. Even now, it's more than likely he's going behind your back for sweets. He's 8 - he isn't old enough to make ALL decisions for himself, sure, but at least give him some agency.",

I actually did a speech on it my senior year of high school\u2026 12 years ago, with plenty of sources. It basically boils down to hyperactivity actually being caused by:\n\n1. Their environment. Hmm kids being hyper at a party, who\u2019d have thought? Nonsense. Must be the sugar. \n\n2. Parents. Parents expect their children to be sugar high, so they attribute any signs of hyperactivity to their sugar. They also mentally exaggerate how hyper their child actually is, whether consciously or subconsciously. There is also a theory that parents make \u201csugar rushes\u201d happen by helicopter parenting after their child consumes sugar or in party situations, which alters the child\u2019s behavior in turn. \n\n3. Caffeine. Chocolate has caffeine in it. The amount varies throughout different chocolate products, some to the point that it is insignificant. However, the point remains that if you never give your child any caffeine and then let them have a ton of chocolate, they\u2019ll probably get an energy boost. It\u2019s pretty unlikely that a little bit of cake gave him enough of a caffeine boost to be noticeable. \n\nI can 100% guarantee it was because he\u2019s 8 and at a birthday party.
