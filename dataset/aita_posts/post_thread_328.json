  "post content": "My cousin lives a 6 hour drive from me and the rest of our family. A few months ago we all drove over there for his wedding. Due to limited space, no children were invited to the wedding except the bride's young nieces and nephews. \n\nMy baby was 10 months old at the time and I wasn't comfortable leaving him alone in an unfamiliar place with a stranger, which was a babysitter that my other cousins hired for their own kids. So I decided to bring him to the wedding. I wrote on the RSVP that I was bringing him but he would be sitting on my lap and I would bring my own food for him. My cousin didn't say anything so I assumed that he was OK with it.\n\nMy baby cried at the ceremony but I quickly took him out of the room. At the reception I had him with me the whole time in a body carrier. He didn't make much of a fuss and I thought everything was OK. \n\nAfter the wedding my aunt (groom's mom) confronted me and told me that I was rude for bringing my baby without permission. I explained that I wrote on the RSVP what I was planning to do but my cousin didn't object. She said that my cousin and his bride had a problem with it but the bride didn't want to start any drama because she doesn't know me well. \n\nMy other cousin's baby was 7 months old at the time and my aunt said that he had no problem leaving his baby with the \"certified\" babysitter and I should of done the same. And some of my cousins were upset because they thought that the groom gave me special treatment by letting me bring my baby and making them leave their kids with a babysitter. I didn't mean to start any drama. AITA?",

Common says if she had difficulties she should\u2019ve confirmed with the bride and groom via phone call, email or call BEFORE she went in. Her desire to be at the event trumped bride and groom\u2019s wishes. They paid for the wedding of their desires. No matter how you slice it this was poorly done on OP\u2019s part. Especially as she displays intelligence though apparently lacking respect and conscientiousness.",
