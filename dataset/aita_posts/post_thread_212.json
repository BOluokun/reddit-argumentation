  "post content": "for context, i (F18), have been working at this coffee shop for over two years now, i close 4 days a week with only me and one manager left to run the store from about 2pm to close. The other three days a kid (M16) closes with a different manager. This is about the only staff we have excluding the owner (who will never close), another kid (M19) who can only work day shifts do to collage, another kid (M18) also works days and does night classes, and a grown man who works in the back baking all morning and has another job in the after noon making him only available in the mornings. So they very clearly need me working there with them. \n\nI\u2019ve been there for a while now and i really don\u2019t mind the people, they can be a bit rude sometimes but i\u2019m super shy and don\u2019t talk much anyway so i stay out of everyone\u2019s way and just get all my work done. Anytime i\u2019ve worked with my manager she tells me about how i\u2019m the best employee she\u2019s worked with and she likes how i just get stuff done. \n\n\nFast forward to a week ago, i went inside of work on one of my off days to say hi order a coffee and get a sandwich, i am a vegetarian, i\u2019ve struggled a lot with food and being able to eat enough for my whole life and i always had a hard time not getting grossed out when eating meat, so i stopped and my relationship with food got much better, so i ordered a grilled cheese and got my coffee and left. \n\n\nI was driving away and i went to take a bite, i take one swallow and it\u2019s fine. When i went to take another i felt a super gross texture and i instantly spit out my food and pulled it apart, they put chicken in my sandwich,(they know my diet and what i normally order), i was so upset but thought it was a mistake so i took the loss on the 3$ sandwich felt a little gross and moved on.\n\nThe next day when i went into work, when i get there there is normally a shift change so i get to see my other coworkers as they leave. I was talking to a guy in the break room while getting ready to work and he was about to leave. I casually made a little joke about how i\u2019m never coming to this place after after they got my order wrong (just trying to mock rude costumers) and i told him about my grilled cheese i ordered and how it came with meat. He laughed and told me that it was actually our manager that made me that and it wasn\u2019t an accident, she wanted to \u201cpull a prank\u201d on me and make me try the chicken cause she said it\u2019s delicious and she even gave it to me free of change anyway.\n\nAfter he told me what she said, i packed up all my stuff took my hat and apron off and told the manager what i heard, how i\u2019m done, and how disrespectful that was to do. I\u2019m still getting calls and texts telling me how rude it was to leave with no two weeks notice and how much this shows that i\u2019m just petty and can\u2019t take a joke. They are so short staffed now they close early and i know it\u2019s affecting Business . \n\nSo am i the ass hole ?",

He knows when they've just picked the onion out of his dish because within half an hour the oil slicks in his eyes start and within an hour, he's throwing up and he literally cannot see due to the pain. \n\nMy sister is highly allergic to fish and shellfish - she let's them know, she asks whether the hot chips have been fried in the same oil as the fish because she's allergic. Usually they're pretty good with the oil and/or what's cooked on the hot plate, the thing she has the biggest problem with is if a dish had fish sauce in it. After one mouthful she knows because her lips start tingling and her throat starts to constrict.\n\nSo yeah, if someone's specifically made it known that they can't have a particular product, whether you think they're \"faking\" or just being fussy, respect their fucking order because they ordered that for a reason.\n\nEdit: sis is a her not a he",

They have to tell the owner, risk the owner finding out about what actually happened, hire somebody new, train them, and probably watch them bail because this is a poorly run business that will likely fail. \n\nOP, if you\u2019d like to own a coffee shop, you\u2019ll probably be able to get that space and the equipment for cheap in 6 months to a year.
