  "post content": "Our son is 22 and our daughter is 26. She bought a house in July. We know that moving into a new home always comes with unexpected costs, right after you've probably depleted most of your funds. So, for Christmas we gave her $4000. Our son we gave a few different gifts totaling somewhere around $800.\n\nOur daughter had to work Christmas, but we did Christmas on the 26th and she stayed with us for the holidays from then until yesterday. Our son still lives with us, and today he told us both that he didn't want to say anything while his sister was here, but his feelings were hurt by the disparity in the value of the gifts. We explained that the gifts we got him were tailored to his interests, but his sister has just passed a big life milestone where money is more important to her right now than sentiment. He said it's still hurtful because it feels like we are more proud of her than him.\n\nMy wife got really frustrated when he said that and asked why he would choose the least charitable interpretation of our actions. He said that's just how he felt and he couldn't control it. I said that we didn't give her money because we were more proud, but because we had experience being new homeowners and knowing that something always breaks in that first six months and it's always expensive. He said that was all fine and good, but it still hurt to get a worse present and feel like an afterthought.\n\nMy wife asked if he expected us to get him four thousand dollars worth of gifts. He said no, but he expected the gifts between him and his sister to be equal. My wife said that's the same thing, and my son said it isn't. He said we could have given her the monetary equivalent of what we gave him. I told him that it isn't really fair for him to decide how much we spend on someone else's gift. Furthermore, cash is less personal than gifts, so giving her a cash equivalent to what he got would be her getting the \"worse\" gift.\n\nHe said we weren't listening to him, just justifying. My wife said we didn't need to justify anything, and he was being entitled. At that point he said he didn't want to talk unless everyone was civil and he went to his room. He skipped lunch (breakfast for him) today, and when he left for work he didn't say goodbye even though I was right by the door.\n\nMy wife is irritated, and my son is clearly resenting us. I can't really decide if we're in the wrong here. On the one hand, we should be able to give our money to whoever we want. On the other, I never want to hurt my son's feelings. Were we wrong?",

Things like wedding money, housewarming gifts/money, graduation gifts obviously came at different times for each of us and were not tied to group holidays like Xmas. \n\nYou could have given your daughter an $800 check or gift for Xmas, and $3200 for closing on the house at a different time/setting. Then you could tell your son \"we will be so excited to give you a gift of money to help out when you buy your first home!\" Instead, now it is a very disproportional Xmas gift, which is sure to raise some jealousy.\n\nEdit: My judgement is very light and you seem like very generous parents who want to help both of your kids get ahead in life. I definitely don't think you \"owe\" your son more now than an explanation and an apology for timing and reaction to his concerns. In the future I would just keep shared gift opening times \"in kind\" for both kids, and stick to milestone gifts timed with the milestone.\n\nEdit: Also getting a lot of \"rent free\" comments about the son. From OPs comments it seems like the daughter lived at home until the house purchase to save up money, and they have no issues with the son living at home now and want the same opportunity for him, so I don't really see it as an applicable factor in the judgement.",

I already bought a house 3 times and never had bad things happening that tanned my experience. It's called budgeting for the house. You don't buy a house without having some extra on the side for some unexpected event. I'm not saying my experience is everyone's experience, but OP is assuming that something bad will happen, but he and his wife could have waited to see if it happens or not. If it does, they could have stepped out and helped. Nonetheless, they should put the same amount aside, for when their son buys or rents a house.",

He described his feelings, where he feels like he hasn't achieved as much as his sister and he feels crummy about that.

Does he feel stuck in some way, like in employment or financially or with his relationships? Parenting doesn't end when he turns 18. Jealousy and inadequacy are feelings we deal with our whole lives.

Your son got 800 dollars worth of gifts, works, and lives at home for free.  That 4000 dollars will absolutely go into that house , for something not as fun as the gifts he got I bet.  Like a broken water heater, shitty electric , so on and so forth.  Your son doesn't need that money right now.   Maybe next year gift him money on a down payment of an apartment and he can decide if he really needed that 4000 dollars in Christmas.\n\nEdit becasue comments are locked:. If the 22 years posted his pov , I'm willing to bet people would be calling him TA.  The fact of the matter is he is a GROWN MAN.  He is living rent free at his parents house. Fact of the matter is someone who just bought a house and paying their own bills, will probably need that 4000 dollars more , than someone who is living at home.  Something will break, and the parents gave her a little best egg to help with those fixes.  People are calling out the parents for not explaining that it's also a house warming gifts.  But at 22 years old he should realize that she'll need that money.  Let's say the be parents decided ok let me write you a check now to make it even. Do you think he'll regret that when he moves out to his own house and can't get that extra money then.  Or if they gave it to him and said you have thirty days to be figure out a place to live.  Becasue the ONLY way it would be considered not equal is if the son was moved out and paying his in own bills.  I'm sure he'll be sad while using those 800 dollar gifts.",
