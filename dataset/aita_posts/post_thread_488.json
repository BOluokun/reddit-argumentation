  "post content": "First off, I'm definitely not implying that anyone else would be the AH in this situation so it's kind of YTA vs. NAH...\n\nI (18F) recently finished my first year of University and made a new friend group with two Indian girls and an Indian guy. Both of the girls really like BTS, and one of them has a poster of them on her wall. I'm not interested in BTS for two reasons: a) I like to know all the lyrics and sing along in my head when I listen to music so I only listen to music in English (yeah I know parts of a lot of their songs have some English but I also don't really like those lyrics) and b) I'm usually not a fan of pop in general.\n\nWe were in the girl with the poster's room and talking about BTS. At one point we were talking about the poster and she asked me who I thought was the hottest. I looked at the poster for a couple seconds, and without thinking I said \"They all look the same\". Instantly regretted it. I know this is a very common stereotype for east Asian people and I really don't want to be contributing to it (I am white). I could tell by the look on their faces I'd said something lowkey offensive but as I told them, I'd never seen BTS other than this poster and I'm not that good with faces.\n\nEdit: When I say not that good with faces, I mean reallyyy bad with faces. I work in a deli and very regularly have people order sliced meat and step away, and 30 seconds later I'll forget what they looked like and who tf this meat is for. I may be digging myself into more of a hole here but honestly, most people look the same.",
