  "post content": "\n\nMe (F.) and My ex husband (M.) are divorced. We have a 16 yo son together \"Mason\". I got remarried to my husband (M.) Nathan.\n\n\nMy ex husband and I used to argue on who should get Mason for the holidays back when he was little. As he got older we started letting him decide. Last year he spend Christmas with me, Nathan and my inlaws and he complained that the experience was \"terrible\" because he said Nathan and his family had little to no accomodation for his food choices (I'm not defending them but my inlaws are quite traditional when it comes to food and a bit ignorant to what types of foods Mason eats). He also said he didn't feel as welcom as the other kids in the family and that Nathan forced him to share his personal stuff like his phone so that his stepnephews could watch christmas movies.\n\n\nYesterday, during breakfast we were talking about christmas and what we were planning this year but hem out of nowhere announced that he'll be spending this Christmas with his dad at a rental christmas cottage in his favorite town. I was stunned, so was Nathan. I asked Mason when and how he agreed to this arrangement but he pointed back to what happened last christmas and said he didn't want to basically \"have another shitty holiday and be miserable\" I told him that his dad should've come to me first but he argued that he's already okayed it and so he saw no need for my opinion. We started arguing and he started complaining about me trying to ruin the experience but in response I told him that he has already ruined christmas for me and his stepdad the minhte he agreed to this arrangement. He got up and walked away after saying that I was being \"overdramatic\". Nathan just sat there and looked down.\n\n\nI had a huge argument on the phone with Mason's dad and he kept giving me an attitude and laughjng and saying that I sounded pathetic. When I told him I'd have my lawyer call him, he bbackpaddeled and said he woukdn't have done this if Mason didn't like it. He urged me to drop it and let Mason have this experience or he'll resent me for missing it. Now Mason isn't speaking to me. Nathan is trying to convince him to stay with us because without him, our christmas is ruined but he won't budge from the looks of it.\n\n\nAITA for not dropping it as well? What I meant by \"why didn't his dad come to me first\" is that he planned to take Mason out of town which is a big deal to me. There's going to be traveling.",

Start thinking of your son.\n\nYou did nothing to make his holiday a good one last year. You let him be miserable and just defended your in-laws. Instead of supporting your son's choice, you throw a tantrum and threaten your ex. Some parent you're being. You're acting more like a kid than your own kid.",

We're going this year and our kids are 7 & 4.  We have a more relaxed dining style with our children (eldest has ADHD, so we have clear expectations for dinner time, but they don't involve staying seated until everyone is done, it involves staying seating while HE'S eating and then he's allowed to leave the table so long as he goes somewhere else to play, and doesn't hang around the room trying to talk to and distract his brother and everyone else.  So there's a standard of behavior for when you're AT the table, and if you don't want to stay seated, you can go do something else.  Because he usually likes being around everyone, it makes it so HE wants to sit down as long as he can, instead of us trying to force him to...  self-motivation does wonders!  But if it's one of those days where he just can't do it, he doesn't get punished for it, he has an opportunity to evaluate himself in that moment and make a choice to do something else.)\n\nMy Sister in law is much more formal with her children and will sit at the table fighting with them to stay seated (sometimes resulting in NEITHER her or her kid eating anything)...  I'm pretty sure this whole dynamic might be...  difficult...  for everyone, so I've already talked to my mother in law, who lives closer and will be driving, not flying, and she's going to bring their favorite ramen, and a few other foods that are quick to prepare and that my son ALWAYS is willing to eat, to make sure that if we have issues around meals, I know my sons will have foods they will eat without complaint.  Because the last thing we need is my kids deciding to be fussy about food, meanwhile her kids are being fussy about sitting down, and then the whole house is chaos!  Or my kids just being so distracted by it all at the dinner table that they don't eat enough, and then are hungry later.\n\nObviously I don't want my kids to eat nothing but ramen and nutella for 5 days, but if that's what it takes to keep them fed, and the drama down, over the holidays I'm going to do it, because my kids getting enough food is more important than whatever my sister in law thinks when I say \"Hey, I'm just going to take the kids into the kitchen and have them eat ramen!\"\n\nEven though the kid in this situation was 15 and not 7, it's still the parent's responsibility to make sure their children's needs are being met in new situations, like their in-law's or step-family's house.  OP just completely failed last year and doesn't even realize it!",

Step mother forced my dad to have me at their house on Christmas day just for me to watch her kids open copious amounts of presents while I got one or two (that my mom would drop off so I had something to open). I'll never forget the year I was 11 - 12y/o  and my step mother made these amazing stockings for my 2 step- and 2 half siblings,  no stocking for me. The next morning there was a stocking with my name on it,  in (obviously) my dad's terrible handwriting, and 1 gift inside, a lovely ring.  She shot daggers at me and him as I opened it.  \nI blame my dad for being whipped just as much as I blame her for being awful.\nThe last Christmas I spent with them was a disaster (i was 13),  ended with my mom picking me up on Christmas eve after a fight with my step brother over a basket ball game.  I grabbed the gifts I had brought for everyone and headed out to the street to wait for my mom.  As i was gathering the gifts from the tree my dad said, \"get your stuff and don't come back\". And i didn't,  not for a couple years at least,  but never for Christmas - I'm 38 now!\n\nThis mom is definitely the AH. I hesitate to believe this is real because I can't believe someone could type this out and not see the error of their ways, but then I also acknowledge there are these types of people out there.\n\nEdit to add: my kids are 12 and 16 now,  and Christmas has always been about spending time/ making memories with our family (me, hubby,  kids,  and my mom + step dad), not about gifts. We share a few meaningful gifts and that's it - no mountains of presents or counting who got how many and who had the better gift.  I only want my kids to have magical holiday memories!",
