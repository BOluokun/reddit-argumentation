  "post content": "Some background...my cousin was married about 3 weeks ago. She is on her honey moon so we agreed to take her daughter on vacation with us. I love my niece, and she is stunningly beautiful, very sensitive and smart but also boy crazy as any other 17 year old. I'm only 25 so I feel I have more in common with her than I do my cousin.\n\nWe went to the pool at the resort the first day and she wore a one piece with a sarong on the way but when she took off the sarong the bottom was a dental floss thong. I mean her entire butt was out. There must be a huge cultural shift in the 8 years between us because she swam and she walked around with no fear. She has several bikinis that are even more revealing.\n\nAs we were laying I sort of brought up the discussion of was she sure that she was comfortable with the attention she was getting. She said it wasn't a big deal to her and it was the style now. She even showed me tons of pics on Instagram to back it up. And I felt like a real old lady when my 17 head old niece talked me into buying 3 thing \"kinis\" of my own that will get here before we leave...so I may be prancing around with my butt out (yikes but fun...I guess?)\n\nAll was fine until my husband's freind who lives in town came over for the day yesterday. He's the friend that I tolerate but will never like because he's never got over not being in college. I could see him checking out Alicia's butt which was really weirding me out. He had a few beers and both me and Alicia are sure he said  \"do you like asshole behind thong pics? because that's how you get asshole behind thong pics\" As she was walking by his chair. Alicia grabbed her towel and took off for the room. I told the friend that was an awful thing to say and he gave me the \"what, I was just being honest\" and then \"what I was just joking\" and then the nerve to say \"what, I was just looking out for her from the pervs around here.\" I told him to get the fuck away from us and tried of catch up with Alicia. Oh the way I ran into my husband coming back from the bar and told him his friend had to leave and don't you dare argue with me about it.\n\nI caught up with Alicia in the room and we had a long talk about how that wasn't her fault and how he was just a jerk and jerks are everywhere. She handled it very well but I suggested that maybe until my swimsuits get here, she should should wear her competition suits or I'd buy her somthing with more coverage. She got really mad at me and said I was making it sound like it was her fault what he said. I was like no, I'm not saying that at all but maybe when I have my equally revealing suits all the \"pressure\" won't be on her since they'll be another woman dressed similar. She said I wasn't making any sense and I sounded just like her mom. I told her I was really sorry, I'm trying to do my best since I'm not usually responsible for a minor. She got very insulted when I said that and hasn't really spoken to me.\n\nI feel bad but was I the asshole ?\n\nEdit: I think people are really misunderstanding and thinking I\u2019m \u201cblaming the victim.\u201d  I don\u2019t feel that way, I feel I\u2019m saying \u201cwait one day and we\u2019ll be dressed alike and we can deal with the shitty comments together.\u201d\n\nEdit: people are still installing their own narrative here, I\u2019m sorry but you are. If you aren\u2019t reading what I actually wrote then I\u2019m really not inclined to listen to your judgment.\n\nEdit: well I\u2019m out folks, either I suck at explaining or there\u2019s a whole lot of agendas being pushed and/or forcing hours own narrative on my situation. If im telling you you\u2019re wrong in the way you\u2019re interpreting my actions, then you\u2019re wrong. You didn\u2019t hear the conversation, you don\u2019t know me, you don\u2019t know my niece. Anything other than what I\u2019m telling you is your narrative. I\u2019m not checking this thread again so spit into the fan all you like and tear me down, I\u2019m done. I gotta tan my ass in my new \u201ckini\u201d with my bomb ass niece who understands the world far better than a lot of you. Bye",

This isn't her first time being sexually harassed and it won't be her last.\n\nI completely agree with this. The niece doesn\u2019t need to change her behavior, the creep does. Telling him to get to fuck was well handled. But OP overstepped by suggesting the niece change her clothes. She can wear whatever she wants. She was uncomfortable with his creepy comments, not with what she was wearing. ESH except the niece.\n\nHaving her not wear something revealing until you get your revealing swimsuit also doesn\u2019t make much sense. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cLet\u2019s wait until we can be harassed in solidarity.\u201d How does that improve the situation in any way?",

So they sat in the kitchen and Caitlin threw random insults that a white van man might shout out the window as they passed and her daughter had to shout back comebacks. It allowed them to broach the subject, discuss it openly and let the daughter decide if she still wanted to go out wearing whatever without feeling insecure.

Putting it on the men feels nice and proper (it\u2019s true, they are the assholes here), but it doesn\u2019t do anything to stop her niece from being harassed and feeling like shit. You can\u2019t just hope it goes away. If they\u2019re both wearing similar stuff and can defend each other, maybe something changes. I just want there to less harassment, and this seems like a good avenue for that.\n\nEdit: The point is the niece is being harassed. She is struggling at shrugging off the harassment, which is understandable (she shouldn\u2019t be being harassed). Expecting to go out and for everyone to have their mind changed on the topic & her never to be harassed is a pipe dream at this moment; it\u2019s going to take time for perception to change. In the meantime, giving her a supportive environment (OP wearing something similar & defending her while doing so) and telling her it\u2019s not her fault seems to be the best option. In the meantime, preventing the harassment from ever coming about seems to be the best choice for the niece. It\u2019s not fair or right, but I think it\u2019s the best solution to the issue.\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019m curious what the niece would have liked OP to do.\n\nEdit2: View changed, I don\u2019t think the OP handled this entirely appropriately necessarily, but I don\u2019t think the way she handled it made her an asshole.",

Revealing clothing is pretty much universally (at least in the US) an invitation for attention.  That's why people wear it.  That gives the creeps who have even a hint of social sense the idea that they are playing into the persons desires by commenting.\n\nIs not wearing revealing clothing going to stop all of it?  Absolutely not.  Is it going to make it significantly less common?  Yes, it is.\n\nThe bottom line is you can only control your own behavior, you can't control what other people do.  So if that sort of thing bothers you, you're either going to have to find a way to make it less likely to occur or grow thick enough skin to deal with it.",

People say things like \"it's comfortable\" or \"I'm just expressing myself,\" but that's just pretext. It's sexual.\n\nIt's not a question of shaming someone. It's a question of whether you're okay with sexualizing a young girl. Based on this premise (I assume) you advised her to tone it down. There is nothing wrong with that. It's common knowledge that when someone sexualizes themselves, they will attract sexual attention from others. That's the whole point, right? \n\nYour husband's friend is an asshole. It sounds like he may have been pointing out the ridiculousness of her outfit, but it's still an inappropriate comment (even if it's true). \n\nYour niece is also an asshole for not expecting attention when she is clearly seeking it. However, she gets a pass for being a dumb teenager. \n\nShe's lucky to have someone like you looking out for her.",

Swimwear like that are meant to sexualize women. That \u201cl am expressing myself\u201d bullshit and I can wear almost to nothing is grossly stupid or naive. Anybody walking with their ass half out would also get sexual attention. You handled it well too.\n\nEdit: is it her choice to wear it? Sure. But damn, even if a man were to walk around a pool with his ass checks out he would get sexual attention. Clothes like that are meant to attract sexual attention. Period.

It shouldn't be the onus of women to cover up to keep men from being gross. Looking is fine, sometimes eyes wander, but staring and commenting are much different. There are plenty of booties on the internet to leer over, they're no need to make teenagers uncomfortable.\n\nIf you get robbed, it is still the fault of the robber. We punish the robber for a reason. We would never find a robber not guilty because of what you were carrying or wearing.\n\nBesides, getting robbed and getting leered at are different. When someone robs you, they have a physical reward. When someone makes crude comments, what's the reward? Feeling smug about putting women in their place? That's skeezy and gross.",

Obviously, if I'm dressing like I'm worth a million dollars in the hood, I'm more likely to get robbed than if I dressed far more casually. It's not saying that the robbery isn't the fault of the robber, but acknowledging that if I don't want to be robbed there are steps I can personally take to mitigate that risk. Should I **have** to take those extra precautions? No, I shouldn't.
