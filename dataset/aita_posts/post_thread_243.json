  "post content": "My (34m) sister gave birth 2 months ago. She brought the baby to mine and my wife's (23f) wedding.\n\nShe breastfeeds whenever she goes. We visit her house? She'll breastfeed in front of us. Visiting our parents? She'll breastfeed. Going out in a public setting? She'll sit on a bench on the park and breastfeed. Go out to a restaurant? She breastfeeds. Every where. I've never spoken on it because I know she'll get mad and offended but when she did that on my wedding I lost my cool.\n\nDuring the reception dinner she just did it again. I kindly approached her and asked her why she didn't bring formula or at least bump milk out and put it in the bottle so she wouldn't have to do all this at that moment. She said \"because I don't have to. I feel comfortable breastfeeding. Getting milk out on my own is more painful\" I said she could just make this sacrifice and compromise for one day instead of doing this in front of 250 guests on my wedding. She then said she can't do much about it now, because the baby has to have her milk. I told her she should be more thoughtful of that then instead of completely embarrassing herself and us by doing this.\n\nI told my wife what the deal was and she said I'm an AH and should immediately apologise to my sister. My parents also sided with my sister and now pretty much everyone thinks I'm an AH since I'm the only person who had a problem with it.\n\nThe only reason I decided to call her out is because I considered it a bad etiquette and tacky to do that at a formal event and that she could just find another solution for that night. AITA?",

I could barely stand, let alone make myself presentable. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem many people here have explained why your suggestions are so bad, so allow me. My twins couldn\u2019t feed directly due to various issues so I pumped every 2 hours round the clock otherwise my milk supply would have been significantly affected. \n\nPumping is horrendous. Genuinely awful. Just the sound of a pump triggers awful feelings in me still and it\u2019s been five years since I stopped. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if she had managed to pump enough milk for the day - although I\u2019m curious how you expected her to do that while exclusively breastfeeding without causing an over supply? Your body makes what the baby (and a pump) takes out. Over supply means pain, discomfort, and often mastitis. Mastitis is very serious, very quickly. \n\nEven if she had a day\u2019s worth of milk with her in bottles (which the baby may refuse, or after bottle feeding she may struggle to latch the baby again), she\u2019d still have to pump throughout your wedding to maintain her milk supply. \u201cJust one day\u201d matters. \n\nYou have absolutely no concept of what you\u2019re asking. You should be thanking her profusely for making the effort to attend and instead you\u2019re attacking her for feeding her baby.
