  "post content": "My wife and I have been married for 7 years and we\u2019ve always talked about wanting kids. We\u2019re  both 29 years old and started trying to conceive about a year ago but have been unsuccessful. We recently decided to get checked out by a fertility specialist and opted to have extensive genetic testing done. The genetic counselor said there isn\u2019t a reason they can point to as for why we haven\u2019t conceived yet, but the bad news is that we are both carriers of a genetic disease that could cause our children to go blind. The risk of having a blind child is about 25% with each pregnancy. \n\nAfter talking about the risks with our genetic counselor my wife and I both came to different conclusions. She still wants to experience pregnancy and childbirth and is okay with taking the 25% chance. I\u2019m not.\n\nI put adoption on the table and she said she\u2019d only be willing to adopt after having a biological child. She says donor sperm isn\u2019t an option because she wants to have *my* kids and that I\u2019m taking that option away from her over a \u201csmall\u201d risk. \n\nTwo night ago we had really bad fight over it. Hurtful things were said by both of us. During the fight I said that pregnancy is hard and most people suffer through it so It\u2019s not like she\u2019s experiencing a great loss. She can keep her flat stomach and not have to suffer through 9 months of sickness. I told her that her mindset is negative. She disagreed with that and said she see\u2019s nothing to be positive about. She called me a coward for wanting to let my kids be fathered by a donor. I responded that of course she\u2019s never going to see the positive in the situation because she\u2019s 100% negative, just like all of her pregnancy tests were the last year and how they always will be. \n\nThat\u2019s the line that caused her to start sobbing and leave the house. She packed a bag and told me she was going to stay with her sister and that she\u2019d call me when she was ready to talk. She\u2019s been gone for two nights now. It will be three if she doesn\u2019t come back tonight.  I don\u2019t want to extend the olive branch and call her first because I\u2019m still pissed. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this post is even a question or a cry for help at this point. \nI have no father figure or male friends I\u2019d feel comfortable talking about this with. Instead I\u2019m asking strangers on reddit  because I\u2019m drunk and at rock bottom. Tonight will be the third night alone in my house drinking by myself and going to bed alone and that terrifies me. Things were completely different a week ago. This sucks. After typing all this out, even I think I\u2019m an asshole.",

If you can prevent your kid from having a disability do it. It's selfish to take that risk, especially when you arnt the one who suffers the most in the end.

OP, if (and that's a massive IF) your wife is still interested in continuing your marriage and having children with you after this, have you looked into the possibility of IVF with PGS (Pre-Implanation Genetic Screening). My husband and I went through this after repeated failures with IVF to make sure there were no genetic abnormalities preventing implantation. If the disease you both carry is genetic, it may be something the screening will pick up and you can then transfer healthy embryos. It's an expensive option, true... and it will be another emotional burden on your marriage as well as taking a massive physical toll on your wife (IVF is no picnic - major understatement), but it is a middle ground that's worth looking into.\n\nBut not before you apologise to her and, if she accepts, get yourselves some counselling.",
