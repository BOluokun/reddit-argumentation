  "post content": "Throwaway because my friends know my main account.\n\nI (28F) was having lunch with a friend (28F) of mine over the weekend. We live in an area with warm weather, so we are able to eat outside socially distant. We were both chatting about how this pandemic sucks and that it has made our dating lives a lot harder than before. While we were chatting I came up with the great idea that my friend should date a colleague of mine (30M). I told her that he is a really great guy and that I would give him her number so he could FaceTime her. She asked me more about him and I kept singing his praises. She then asked me why I had not ever considered dating him if he was as great as I made him out to be. I explained to her that he is a teacher like me and that his potential earnings are not high enough. She got very offended by this statement and asked me why I would try and set her up with someone who I myself was not willing to go out with. I tried explain to her that since she works in Finance and makes more than double what I make that she can date some who does not make a lot of money because she can afford to pay for a nice lifestyle. She got even more offended by this and said that she normally dates men in a profession similar to her and that coincidentally men who work in that field tend to make the same amount of money as her. She said my statement about paying for a nice lifestyle made her sound like someone's cash cow. After this went down she asked the waitress for her half of the bill and left me with half of the bill. I am very hurt by this as I was only trying to help my friend. I think she is being shallow and is the AH for saying she normally dates men who are in her profession who make a lot of money, but she thinks I am the AH for trying to set her up with someone who I would not date myself without good reason, so reddit, who's TA here?",

You're criticizing her for not dating him cause he doesnt make enough money, but you wont date him cause he doesnt make enough money. How is that any different?
