  "post content": "I (34F) have 3 kids, 2 are adopted from China. 3 years ago we got matched we decided to announce it to the family at our Christmas party. When we said \"We're adopting\" the first words out of my sister's(now 32F) mouth were \"Me too\" I was very confused as she had never seemed interested in adoption so I asked her what she meant a few minutes later and she started telling me all about the new corgi she was getting.\n\nI was kinda annoyed because I feel like it's weird to compare the adoption of pets to human children but I let it go at the time, fast forward about 7 months when we were home with the girls. They were 4 and 7 and the grieving process was very hard and it was just a difficult adjustment in general. When I tried to call my sister she kept comparing it to her dog(Which she had gotten a few months earlier). Like I would tell her some things that are triggering to my daughters and she would say \"Oh yeah, Howie had trouble with that on the first few days but we just kept exposing him to it and he got used to it\" (Howie is her dog)\n\nFirst of all that is TERRIBLE advice and second she would say it like she was some experienced parent give advice to a new mother, she has a stepson but he was 11 when she met him and 13 when she became his stepmom(She has not adopted him and her and her husband choose for her not to be a parental figure for him) so I don't really think it's her place to be giving out parenting advice.\n\nWell the last straw was that I go to a zoom adoptive parents support group and yesterday we had an event type thing where you could bring in a friend or someone who may be considering adoption and give them a little insight from the parents point of view. My sister asked me to invite her as she said she may adopt one day. I did and when they started talking about how sometimes in orphanages childrens hygiene aren't taken care of(AKA they don't have their teeth taken care of and often wear the same clothes for multiple says in a row) my sister started talking about how it was similar to how her dog was treated in the shelter and how annoying it was to have to take him to the vet for his teeth because they weren't properly cared for in the shelter.\n\nEveryone in the meeting looked very uncomfortable, especially the women in charge who is an adoptee. After the meeting we were talking on the phone and I tried to tell her nicely that was an inappropriate thing to say when talking about inhumane conditions of actual children but she accused me of not caring about inhumane conditions of dog shelters. I said \"I do care about that but it's not the same as children. And adopting a dog from a shelter is not the same as adopting a child and doesn't make you an adoptive parent\" She hung up on me and blocked me on facebook. Did I say something wrong, am I the a-hole here?\n\nEdit: I didn't \"Invite her\" specifically, I reposted the event to my facebook page and my sister messaged and asked me to invite her. And this was not a conversation type thing, it was a presentation put on by the group leader/agency rep so I didn't think she would have much time to talk and also I thought this would help her learn more about actual adoption and how different it is to animal adoption.\n\nEdit 2: I do understand what it's like to have a dog and how their like a baby in some way(I have 4) but I still would never compare the adoption of my dogs vs the adoption of my daughters.",

I call my pets my babies, and i have a hard core bleeding heart for animals that are abused or neglected or in shelters that dont provide what they need, but its apples and oranges to human adoption. The state of orphanages that neglect their kids can be awful and heartbreaking (i have two adopted sisters from Ukraine who came from an orphanage where they were not fed enough and had very little human contact) and its is a completely separate issue. Both are terrible circumstances, and both can manifest really difficult issues once the adoptee finds their new home, but they are not the same issue and cant be compared that way.",
