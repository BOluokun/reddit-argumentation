  "post content": "\nEversince my brother passed away at the age of 17 on his birthday, My family decided to never celebrate birthdays ever again. It was mom & dad's decision; but because of how much the family loved my brother, extended family decided to do the same and stand in agreement with this decision.\n\n\nMy husband would refuse to follow this decision, and kept celebrating his birthday. Me and the family didn't say a thing about it since he's not blood family. But when I first got pregnant, the argument about celebrating our daughter's birthdays occured. My family adviced me to just not celebrate her birthday since she's a baby and won't even remember anyway. I agreed but my husband threw a fit and insisted that we celebrate our daughter's 1st birthday. I caved in eventually but told him we'd have a small, secret celebration so that my family wouldn't find out. He agreed.\n\nThe next day, I got a call from mom and she was so upset saying that my word meant nothing and that I have no respect for my brother's memory nor the family. I asked what she meant and she told me she saw the birthday party pics my husband posted on social media. I was to shocked to even argue. I hung up and went straight to my husband to confront him about it. He got defensive and said that he didn't need my permission to post pics, and that he wanted to show his family the birthday celebration pics since I \"insisted\" we have a small, secret party and \"exclude\" them. I explained to him how this made me look bad and a liar to my family but he said \"they can get over it\" and called my mom \"snooby\". I blew up at him and we had a huge fight about it. He started sulking later and said I ruined the memory of our daughter's first birthday for him and \"verbally abused\" him with how I lashed out. But I solely did it out of frusrtation knowing that what happened caused a massive problem between me and family.\n\n\nNow he's expecting an apology from me.\n\nAITA?",

Your children and husband did not consent to this.\n\nIt honestly sounds like your family might need some therapy all around. It is sad someone died but the living should not have to pay a price for it every year. Birthdays are about celebrating the LIFE of the person BORN THAT DAY, not about the death of a person born a different day. ETA: I bet your brother would be appalled this was his legacy - telling everyone that their life isn't as important as his.\n\nYou do look bad, and you are a liar. You should have stood up and said \"We celebrating the life of my daughter\" to your family. Go apologize to your husband.",

It wasn't even the day of Grandma's death... most people remember the date of death not the date of the funeral, so I didn't even get why she wanted to make a deal of it to start with.\n\nShe'd made a few offhand comments about it right after the baby was born and I'd tell her, \"Well now we have a happy memory for tht day, and you know Grandma would have been the first one to say we need to focus on the living not the dead because they're already gone to their rest.\"\n\nI thought it was settled until about 3 weeks before my daughter's 1st birthday and she started up on the whole, \"Don't have her party ON her birthday, that's the day we buried Mommy!\" and I kind of lost it.  I told her I'd better NEVER hear her bring that up in front of my daughter because she didn't need to be made to feel guilty about being born.  I reminded her the whole family made it a tradition to go to the cemetery on the date of Grandma's death to clean her headstone and bring tons of flowers and plants and spend a couple of hours beautifying the spot and remembering her... And that if she couldn't get it out of her system then so she could show up to the party and focus on her grandchild instead of moaning and wailing then she could just not come. \n\nI still to this day don't know why this ever had to be a thing.
