  "post content": "Throwaway account, obviously, as the people involved are frequent redditors.\n\n\nThis has been on my chest for a while now, and I honestly dunno if this is the right thing to do, so posting it here. Some facts changed for recognition.\n\n\nI had a friend group on Sunday that did gaming and such, pre-COVID. It was made up of three boys and three girls, one of the girls being me, and we held it at one of their apartments. The other two girls, let's call Cindy and Eileen.\n\n\nCindy has mental health issues and sometimes struggles to show up on time. When she doesn't make it, every other member of the group is super concerned about her and showers her on our Skype chat with comforting messages.\n\n\nAs COVID was kicking in, I lost someone really close to me. Did not even merit a 'that sucks'. I think I got an 'ok' in chat on that one. Had a mental breakdown, didn't show up for a month, nothing. Recovered, started on anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication, and am trying to turn things around. Not even a peep of concern. A single \"are you ok, you've been gone for a while and we miss you\" would have helped pull me out of that pit of self-hate immensely. But Cindy can be like \"I don't wanna join today, I'm gonna go eat a pizza and lie down\" and everyone in chat is instantly \"we love you, Cindy! Feel better!\"\n\n\nMaybe they don't feel the same way about me that I did about them, I dunno. I know it's a gaming group, not a support group, but it makes me feel so unwanted at the end of the day and furious to see those messages of support for someone else that I've just started being a complete spiteful bitch. I've said a lot of really hateful things I don't mean, and ended the previous session early as a result.\n\n\nTL;DR: AITA for trying to derail a gaming group over concern-jealousy for a depressed person?",

It sucks when it takes something like this to realize that.\n\nThat being said, this one girl didn't cause the group to be like that. She didn't ask for the attention, and she didn't tell them not to give it equally to you. You're completely in your right to feel spite, but it shouldn't be aimed at her.\n\nEdit: my ESH is solely based on what we were given. I don't think OP sucks at all. I think she's going through something horrible, and she needed the support of her friends (MAN I get that!! When my dad died, my supposed best friend was nowhere in sight!).

I know you've had to deal with your illnesses and your hardships on your own, but that doesn't mean your friends really couldn't care less for you. It could be that they genuinely didn't know. They might have thought you had a handle on it. People get scared to death to confront grief and mental health issues. They don't know what to say or do; they don't know what you need or want and they don't know what would be crossing a line. When you're the one hurting, you very much just want an \"are you okay,\" and that's easily done; I'm sorry you didn't get that. But, your friends may not have known you needed that. If you didn't open up about it, even if you had expressed that had happened, they may not have known you WANTED their expressed concern.

Try expressing your hurt in a way that won't ruin your friendships. It shouldn't be on your shoulders, and it doesn't feel fair, but sometimes we have to sacrifice a little bit of our pride to make sure we reach the outcome we need to heal. Talk to them about it.

She's mentally ill, just like you are. Don't kick her while she's down just because she's getting support and you aren't.

That nonreaction was crappy of them. You want friends who will think about you when you\u2019re going through a crisis. You know it\u2019s a reasonable expectation from them because of the care your other friend gets. You want to know you matter to them, too. You\u2019re not an asshole for wanting that.\n\n Something to think about is maybe your neglect wasn\u2019t deliberate or a reflection of their values. Everyone was feeling upside down at the start of the pandemic. They could have been caught up in their own emotions and lost in the 2020 haze. Their nonreaction was still super crappy, though. Mull it over decide if it would change anything about how you feel, big or small. \n\nThe attention your depressed friend is getting is probably a case of \u201cthe squeaky wheel gets the grease.\u201d Maybe they wouldn\u2019t say jack to her if she didn\u2019t discuss her struggles so often. But she does, so it feels like you\u2019re being left in the cold and punished for not wanting to throw things out there like she does. \n\n  There\u2019s nothing wrong with you for not wanting to talk about it like she does. It\u2019s a personality difference. She\u2019ll get more recognition from this particular group of friends because of it, and that\u2019s frustrating but inevitable part of being a private person. You might be able to manage that expectation if you weren\u2019t already in so much pain, but losing someone puts everything in hard mode for a while.\n\nThe sucky result is that you don\u2019t feel seen or cared for, and not being seen makes you feel disregarded and like not much of a person. \n\nBeing mad at your depressed friend personally is misdirected anger, but your post indicated you already know that. Does feeling that anger make you an asshole? Hell no. Misdirected anger is part of the human experience. What\u2019s unfair is acting on it and being spiteful. I think you already know that, too, but don\u2019t know what the hell to do with it. It\u2019s hard, isn\u2019t it? It really, really sucks, and it\u2019s so easy to end up invalidating yourself and everything you feel with that guilt.  \n\n  If you feel safe enough to do it, apologize for what you know wasn\u2019t called for and try opening up about how hard your loss has been for you and how lonely you feel. See if you get the same degree of compassion when you show them that you\u2019re hurting. See if they check in with you sometimes. If they do, you\u2019ll know they got lost in the 2020 sauce and you still matter to them. If they don\u2019t, you\u2019ll know this isn\u2019t a friend group you want to be a part of. That would be hard, but it\u2019s better than feeling invalidated all the time. \n\n  No matter what, it\u2019s okay to leave. You aren\u2019t obligated to keep the group together when you aren\u2019t enjoying it. \n\n  I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Take care of yourself.",
