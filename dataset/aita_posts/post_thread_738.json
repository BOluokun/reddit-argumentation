  "post content": "I've (27M) been friends with Jack (27M) since college. We graduated from the same program and we've remained buddies, hanging out every week. We met through lifting but we've both slowed on the gym since then. \n\nNeither of us have the ripped bodies we had at 19 and 20. I still go a couple times a week but these days I'm rocking a solid \"dadbod\". I'm 6 feet tall weighing 220 lb, 215 on a good day, got some pudge and a small belly but I wouldn't call myself fat.\n\nJack gained weight too, no judgment because so have I, that's life. We're the same height but he's definitely chubbier than me by a good 15 pounds.\n\nThe other day we were hanging out. I was wearing Levi jeans, the ones that have the size printed on the logo on the waistband (W36 L32, they look like that). At some point in the night I guess Jack snuck a peek. He exclaimed, *\"Bruh! You wear size 36 now!?\"* When I looked over at him he was chuckling, looking down at my belly and had a big smile across his face.\n\nSo I lifted up his shirt and gestured to his belly, *\"Yeah and what size do you wear, fatso?\"* I said it with an air of laughter, not in a mean way. I thought he'd take the banter and we were just guys being guys, but he immediately sucked in his gut as if I had embarrassed him and he yanked his shirt back from my hand, pulling it down to cover his belly. \n\nThe next few days Jack wasn't talking to me, and when I finally confronted him he told me I was way out of line. I'm confused because he made the first move commenting on my jean size, and all I did was lob the same banter back and I thought it was standard banter and guys being guys.\n\nAITA?",

If he is sensitive about his weight you shouldn't tease him about it and should apologize for doing so. Likewise, he shouldn't have opened that line of \"banter\" by insulting your waist size.",
