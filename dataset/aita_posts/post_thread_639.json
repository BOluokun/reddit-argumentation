  "post content": "(For context, me and my ***Wife*** are in our late 30\u2019s, married for 4 years)\n\nI\u2019m rarely the type to ever get fever sick in general and when I do, I just drown myself in \u2018feel better products\u2019 (nyquil, soup, tea, orange juice) for a day or 2 while also just taking it easy. My fianc\u00e9e on the other hand is complete opposite. She passively feels \u2018off\u2019 everyday due to something: not handling work stress well, bored from working at home, hating the weather (no matter what season, they all suck), feeling drained because she never really eats well, feeling lethargic because she doesn\u2019t exercise regularly, etc. If she is does ever get fever sick, she simply goes to bed and will not go back to work until she feels better (maybe a day or 2).\n\nSo, I recently started to feel sick (fever, cold chills, sneezing nonstop, low energy) and I did my usual slow down and recover effort. The first day I made it clear why I\u2019m moving slower and just acting off so there no unsaid surprise. I didn\u2019t complain. I said very little through the day and just went into autodrive. When day 2 rolled around, I still felt off but better.\n\nMy wife asks if I will be going to the gym as usual and I said no.\n\nShe then proceeds to get mad at me for asking how she was feeling since I know I am off.\n\nShe goes into left field telling me how she is surprised how I can\u2019t sympathize with her and ever feel proud about her daily struggles.\n\nI ask what she is talking about.\n\nShe tells me that the way I currently feel is how she feels everyday and that I never acknowledge her efforts for only mildly complaining everyday instead of losing it completely.\n\nI was baffled and asked her why I am being yelled at for simply asking how she is feeling for the day. I already still feel bad overall but now I\u2019m being yelled at for not making efforts apparently in the past.\n\nAs she keeps pushing for a fight, I eventually I tell her that she is a Narcissist and that it\u2019s shitty to kick me when I down in health. I confirm that I do make efforts to sympathize with her but at a certain point she is just complaining without making any effort to address the problem or relax to unwind from it all. I told her that in a way I\u2019m starting to see that she is acting like her dad (which she hates for similar reasons as this scenario). Bold comment I admitted, but the scenario is almost exactly the same as what she delt with except she was in the hospital and he made her feel like crap because he visited & was complaining non-stop about his minor issues that were just a joke.\n\nThese types of scenarios have been occurring a lot more in the last 2 years but it really hits me the hardest when she pulls them when I get sick. I literally try to avoid her when I get sick because this legitimately happens every time for one reason or another.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Confirmed wife/married. Apparently that threw everyone in a loop for since I quick typed the question and tripped over my thoughts.",

None of this sounds like narcissist behavior, just a woman who deals with general malaise (and perhaps depression, but I'm not a psychiatrist) regularly and feels she doesn't receive the validation she deserves. She handled her reaction poorly; that doesn't mean you don't also deserve validation and sympathy when you are feeling unwell.\n\nHowever, throwing terms around like \"narcissist\" because someone acts selfishly is inappropriate. NPD is an actual condition with specific behaviors and diagnoses. It's become a trump card to shut people up when they're just acting shitty, and it's wrong.\n\nHonestly I think couple's therapy could do you both a world of good. This mostly sounds like a breakdown in communication that has festered for so long it has caused resentments in you both.",

The period cold happens in the middle of our cycle where the hormones cause our immune system to decrease in function dramatically. It's around the time of ovulation I believe but I may be wrong and it's the 1st week. \n\nTo sum that up, a normal cycle is around 4 weeks. For 1 week we have the period cold, for 1 week we have pms or in a lot of cases pmdd, and 1 week for our period. So people with uteruses literally have 1 week in our lives every month that we feel \"normal.\" Guess what, there's next to nothing you can do about this besides using birth control to stop your period completely, getting a hysterectomy, and using vitamins to supplement in between. \n\nImagine how fun that must be for us.",

I told him that I had just thought it was menstrual cramps because they also can feel like that and make me want to hurl. The only reason I finally realized that wasn't what was happening was because I started to experience pain that started higher up and then kind of shot down. \n\nNot to say that getting sick doesn't suck in general. It does. I feel bad for anyone with a cold.

She couldn't hold a job and wouldn't do things around the house. She didn't have the energy to do anything in the marriage. She would suddenly have energy for fun activities, tho, then be tapped out for the rest of normal life with chronic pain. He started to lose patience and stopped the support and validation. She started to claim he was gaslighting her and emotionally abusing her. He was extremely worn down and they eventually divorced. Funny enough after she blew through her alimony and all other forms of welfare and support, she finally faced the music and had to start fending for herself. She magically found the energy to get into shape and got a job. The complaints about her health are gone. Now she just complains about her ex and does things on purpose to flaunt her new self to gain the attention of her ex.

Oral minoxidil, folks.  It works.  And dermatologists only keep patients if they solve problems.  Word gets out.  So they're great.  But otherwise, I completely get giving up on doctors.\n\nIt is time and energy you don't have, when there is too much else to get done.  I figure I may as well wait until I wind up in an ER, because I'm not getting help before then anyway.  I just have to hope it isn't the aneurysm that sends me there, cuz I may just roll straight into the morgue. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI can't really say if OP's wife is bitching all that much or if she just feels like he really isn't hearing how bad things are for her.  I'm going to guess ESH.\n\nOP sounds less than sympathetic to his spouse and her outburst may be in response to that.  And I know I'm tired of hearing about and experiencing my own medical BS, so I figure everyone else is, too.  So, if she's constantly focused on her health issues and never getting anything done on her life or the house or her relationship, I can see where that would get old.  No matter how tired (or afraid) you are, you have to try to live a little.",

It also gets discouraging to test for things and have those things not turn out to be anything and you still feel like crap and they don\u2019t know why. It does feel like a waste of money.\n\nAnd the answer is just to get another doctor and try and push through until they can finally find something that either a.) is a reason that was hard to find or at minimum b.) find something to help with your symptoms. But this can take literal years and a good team and it\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019m not excusing her behavior about yelling at her husband while sick and like I said you shouldn\u2019t give up entirely because you\u2019ll never find help that way so I\u2019m not defending the way she\u2019s living, but I do understand why she feels that way because I have in the past felt that way myself.\n\nI also know it can be very draining to be on the other side (in my case it was for my poor family having to watch me be in pain and hear me be upset), so I understand what he means, and I did my best to not go at it too hard, but sometimes it felt like I had to or I\u2019d lose my mind and snap (and I\u2019m sure to some people it felt like I was still complaining too much even though I was trying very hard and I do feel bad for them for that even though I know I did my best).

And while those things may be true, these reasons are often given without the appropriate investigation or these reasons are actually symptoms of other issues.\n\n Serious medical conditions are often left untreated. Getting the run around makes it so defeating to go to a doctor when you know they are going to basically pat you on the head. On top of all of that, exercising when you feel chronically fatigued is really hard and probably takes more energy than you get out of it. While eating a healthy diet is always a good idea, doing so takes a lot of mental energy that people with chronic health conditions struggle to maintain.\n\nSo imagine a scenario where OP's girlfriend is developing hypothyroidism, or she has long COVID or anemia... She may have sought help in the past and been told it was just in her head. Her boyfriend tells her to get in shape or stop complaining, but she is just so tired and can only focus on getting through the day. She may not be the whiney, selfish person that OP sees, just a chronically I'll person. \n\nAgain, I don't know about OP's situation. However, I know that a relative of mine said I loved to complain and wouldn't help myself. Turns out, I had an undiagnosed health condition. The doctors were shocked that I was doing as much as I was, considering the state of my health. Going through that (and seeing it happen to friends) has made me side-eye anyone who talks about a woman in their life like OP is doing.",

It is intensely draining being with a spouse who is content to complain every day but does not do anything to address the issues - I think you could try apologising for the narc comment, and then clearly stating to her that something needs to change or you will not be staying in the relationship. \n\nHaving someone with such a negative frame of mind offloading to you all the time wears you down after a time. For your part, in future - be wary of what you let slide and practice calmly telling the other person how their behaviour affects you. If they flip out at your response, it means they have a bit of work to do to be a good partner.\n\nIt can be hard to navigate trying to have empathy and be supportive, but not to get in to a situation where someone is just using you as their emotional support crutch.",

If someone has a problem they refuse to solve, I will eventually just tell them I'm no longer the audience to complain to. Something like \"honey, I love you, but I can't listen to you be in pain/tired every day for the rest of my life. If you don't want to see a doctor, that's your choice, but I can't listen to you talk about it without trying to make it better. If you ever do want to see a doctor, I'm here to help and be supportive of that. I'm really sorry you feel so bad, but I can't have our entire relationship revolve around how you're feeling every day unless I know we're working as a team to make it better.\"",
