  "post content": "I\u2019m 27m. My parents were 18 when they had me and up until recently I had zero contact with my mom for the reasons bellow:\n\n1. She was a party girl when I was growing up so I was always watched by my grandma instead of her. Was obvious she wasn\u2019t that interested in being a mom \n\n2. Cheated on my dad constantly behind his back since he was working so much\n\n3. This is the Major One. I was diagnosed with leukemia when I was 9. What did she do? Took off because it became too much and she couldn\u2019t handle it. My dad was there for me every step of the way.\n\nI survived but that deeply messed me up for a long time. My dad was the best ever and he had me in therapy for a long time after to get over the hurt she caused. She didn\u2019t come back, I finally got to a place where I didn\u2019t care anymore and considered her dead in my mind.\n\nThe most surprising thing I learned recently is now *she\u2019s* the one with cancer. My aunt told me it\u2019s terminal and doesn\u2019t have that long left. They\u2019ve said less than a year but idk how long she\u2019s had this diagnosis.\nEveryone in my family knows what she did.\n\nThe only person who stayed in contact with her was my aunt (her sister) and she tells me my mom has changed a lot. All she wants is to talk to me before she dies so we can have closure. I told my aunt exactly what I said in the title. \n\nI can\u2019t see my mom and listen to whatever excuses she has when in my mind I\u2019ve already let her go. There\u2019s no point in bringing up old shit when I\u2019ve moved on and if she just wants this so she could leave this earth with a clean conscience then I wanna see her even less.\n\nMy aunt didn\u2019t like any of what I said. We did argue back an forth trying to defend my mom because she is full of regret and it\u2019s important to find it on my heart to do this.\n\nShe\u2019s telling everyone now and a lot of them are torn. Some of them get she did the same to me so I don\u2019t owe her but others are being vocal about how I should be \u201cthe bigger person\u201d and I shouldn\u2019t be talking like that about her.\n\nThe sad part it\u2019s family who I care about saying these things so it\u2019s making me feel conflicted if I\u2019m being an a-hole. Not that I plan to see her but Still these are people who saw what she did to me and are telling me I\u2019m somehow in the wrong.",
