  "post content": "Not good at making titles so let me explain, also sorry for bad formatting. \n\nI am a 16 year old high school student with a rigorous course load this semester and an even worse one next semester. I work as a busboy in a restaurant and am currently scheduled for two days a week. I work Sundays about 11-6, and Mondays 3-11. My schooling is important to me and will come first and my Sunday shift is always fine but Monday\u2019s are tough. This school year is an awkward one due to Covid, I have lots of homework and often have to re teach and study subjects. My school gets out at 2:30 and my shift starts at 3 so I have zero time to actually do my homework. The busser I work with is in the same position and we switch off closing shifts every other week and it\u2019s sucks. We stay until 12 if we close which leaves zero time for homework. Anyway, I have been working here for quite awhile and haven\u2019t closed and even in this manner. The bartender I work those days makes us do a ton of stuff and doesn\u2019t make any compromise to get us home early. One day I asked\u201dwhat do we need to do\u201d with some attitude in my voice and last week my boss called me into the office and threatened to fire me and ave me the solution to my problem by calling in and asking to come in at 3:30, I explained that this doesn\u2019t even give me time to finish my math homework and I have 4 classes. \n\n\nI understand that he has a business to run but it is unrealistic to say that and expect us to stay that late. I understand the attitude wasn\u2019t good but it is upsetting, to be stuck there. \n\nIs unrealistic of me to be upset about having to stay all night and having no help closing from the bartender and being stuck late at night and told not to prioritize school? \n\nTL;DR: I work at a restaurant and also have school, my shift starts right after school and am upset Bc I don\u2019t have time for homework, boss threatens to fire me and than tells me not to prioritize school.",
