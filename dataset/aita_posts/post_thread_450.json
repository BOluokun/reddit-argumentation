  "post content": "My husband and I (both 27) got married a few weeks ago and he obviously is still upset about it but I don\u2019t think I was wrong so I thought I would ask here.\n\nWe only gave plus ones to married couples or if we knew the SO well. My husband has one childhood friend that was coming from out of state to attend. I\u2019ve met him a bunch but only his girlfriend of three years a few times because of the distance. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to give him a plus one but my husband begged since he was traveling and didn\u2019t know anyone else at the wedding and he didn\u2019t want him to be uncomfortable or have to travel alone. I said fine just to make him happy. \n\nFlash forward to the reception I see him with some girl I have never seen before. I asked husband what was up and he told me that his friend and his gf broke up a few days before the wedding and since he already rsvped as 2 he brought a friend with him. \n\nI was pissed since I made an exception for him and I didn\u2019t want anyone random at my wedding. I had one of my bridesmaid go to him and tell him he could stay but can his date please go back to the hotel this is a private event. \n\nHe said ok and didn\u2019t make a fuss but he left with her and didn\u2019t come back. I though on everything was fine and had a great night. \n\nMy husband found out about it the next day and we got in an argument. He\u2019s mad because his friend traveled and I kick him out without talking to him. I didn\u2019t kick him out just his date. \n\nNow it\u2019s a few weeks later my husband still brings it up from time to time and his friend hasn\u2019t been answering his texts. I kind of feel bad but it was my wedding and I didn\u2019t want any strangers there.",

So long as you have room in the budget and there isn\u2019t a known issue or conflict with any of the invitees, offering people plus ones is just the decent thing to do, especially if they don\u2019t know many other people in attendance. No one wants to come to an event like that alone, where nearly everyone\u2019s a stranger to them.\n\nYou can harp all you want about it being \u201cyour\u201d day, but any decent hostess considers the comfort and enjoyment of her guests. You clearly only considered yourself. You didn\u2019t even give a damn about what your husband wanted. Rude AF and embarrassing behavior on your part. Of course YTA.",
