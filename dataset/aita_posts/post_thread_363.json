My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for a year and celebrated our anniversary three weeks ago. \n\nWhile at the party, one of my friends asked my boyfriend about school and work etc. My boyfriend has a degree in African languages and works at a non-profit. \n\nI had a quite a lot of drinks, so I called my boyfriends degree useless because he doesn't make much money at his job. In a funny way of course. Most of my friends laughed. \n\nOne friend told me it was an asshole thing to say. My boyfriend wasn't happy either, although his degree really isn't all that useful. \n\nEver since my boyfriend has been kinda cold and I feel like an ass.",

You likely made everyone uncomfortable and that was awkward laughter you received. You obviously see yourself as superior to him: You're not. You're pathetic and likely soon to be single.\n\nYour boyfriend's degree sounds fascinating. You sound like a total bore.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the fun and generous awards.\n\nTo all the depressing  \"But IT IS a uSeLeSs soup kitchen can't pay his loans degree!!!\" griping: Think and dream bigger, people. Please. If everyone just pursued the most reliably financially profitable path in their lives what an even more miserable place the world would be. It's like people didn't even see that he has a job. Let the man do his life, damn.\n\nThis misery loves company trajectory that society has us on is not the answer. Just because so many of us are making choices we rather not to pay our bills doesn't mean we have to heckle this dude and his neat af degree.\n\nOne final pissy edit: If you are a dumbdumb who thinks This Guy and people like him are The Ones responsible for the student debt crisis and The Only Ones who support student debt cancellation then I hope you don't have a degree cuz it would mean you spent a lot of time, effort and money and still can't drive your brain.",

So there was this song that was passed down through generations in a family/community brought over to be slaves. The individuals were sure to try and pass it along as accurately as possible. They said that wherever they go and they run into people who know that song, then they are among family (or something like that\u2026maybe it was home?). Some linguists had a recording of the song from the early 1900\u2019s. Maybe 1930ish? By this time the song had been passed down they think 200 years. To be clear, they didn\u2019t know the translation of the song into English, they memorized the sounds. \n\nWell, these linguists just decided to travel around Africa to try and find where the song came from. I\u2019m sure they had a bit of method to their madness. They were about to give up when they came to a village and played a recording of the song. The people they were talking to started singing along!!! The scientists had found the community where the song originated!! They brought over the descendants of the woman in the early 1930\u2019s recording to meet the individuals in Africa.\n\nSo some slaves were capture from Africa, brought to the US, and passed down a song through generations. There was so little distortion from the original by both groups that people were able to track down the location where the song originated\u2026and therefore tracked down where these individual\u2019s ancestors\u2019 were likely taken from. The linguists even think that the Americans song is closer to the \u201coriginal\u201d song as they had been directly memorizing it through generations. Meanwhile their contemporaries in Africa were speaking the words in a living language and therefore under the influence of the natural shifts that occur in language.",

It's what sparked my interest in programming in the first place.  \n\nI don't work in programming, but I do game dev on a hobbyist basis and participate in game jams, which is a blast.\n\nI'm a US based tax preparer and I've found that taxes hold my interest in similar ways.  And oh my, is that a system, and an enormous one.  And oh my are there bugs and unintended effects, perverse incentives, and poor design there, too.  Spaghetti code and obvious patches from years of revisions by multiple parties is not just for programming.

Spending time with him is like pulling teeth without anaesthetic.\n\nHe also used to give me shit because my degree is in a much more niche area - he would frequently tell me I didn\u2019t work a real job, or mock my achievements because apparently any old idiot could do what I did and I didn\u2019t have to work as hard as him...
