  "post content": "UPDATE:\n\nI officially submitted the paperwork to John to get payment for the debt. However I decided that would forgive 1/4th of the debt.  So instead of claiming $37K, I am claiming $27,750.00.  I told my siblings that I would forgive a fourth - and if keeping the house for Sara is important to them then they each need to come up with the same.  So far they are saying they will not contribute. \n\nJohn and I spoke with the lawyer and we were wrong about how any cash from the sale of the house would be dispersed.  First - any liquid assets have to be used to cover debts.  Then if assets need to be liquidated, then whoever was supposed to get that asset gets whatever proceeds are left after paying debts. So no matter what my siblings do - Sara will get the rest of the money if the house is sold. \n\nThe lawyer also pointed out the same thing many people here did - that giving Sara the money could affect her benefits.  Instead he suggested she turn down the inheritance in favor of placing the money into a special needs trust for her son. Sara will be talking to the lawyer on her options and exactly what that means.\n\nSara is attempting to get a loan using the house as collateral.  Not all the paperwork is in order yet (exactly how much will be left in the estate after all debts are paid) - and we are probably looking at needing to get a professional appraisal of the home first.  One person at the bank talked to her and said that with her credit score and income she doubts she would be approved - but that she would process the application once Sara got all the data. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nMy mother died about 2 months ago. She didn\u2019t leave behind much other than a paid for house (worth about $180K) and a little money in the bank. Mom announced a couple of years ago that she intended to leave her house to my sister Sara who takes care of her severely disabled son full-time.  Mom said that she wanted to make sure they had a roof over their heads and the rest of her kids could make it on their own.  Sara does struggle a lot and has said many times that she wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it without Mom.\n\nWhen Mom died she had some bills outstanding, but her biggest debt was that she owed me $37K. I had loaned her the money so that she could fix her plumbing and septic system, as well as making the house more handicapped friendly for Sara and Jeremy. Mom had been paying me back every month. I have paperwork proving the money is owed.\n\nHere is the problem. If I file a claim against her estate like any other creditor would do, my brother John (Mom\u2019s executor) will have no choice but to pay it. But to do so \u2013 he will have to sell the house since there isn\u2019t money in the estate to pay it any other way. Which means that Sara and Jeremy will have to find a different place to live.  I know Mom wanted Sara to have the house. There is also the issue that Mom\u2019s will said Sara got the house, but any money in the estate would be split evenly between the other 4 of us. So technically we think that means Sara wouldn\u2019t actually get anything (John is talking to a lawyer to make sure he is reading that right). Sara is also concerned that if she did get a large amount of money (John and I have both said we would give her whatever we got from the house if it does get sold) \u2013 that it could interfere with the help she gets from the government.\n\nJohn and Sara are both pushing me to not file a claim against the estate. But if I don\u2019t \u2013 then the loan basically goes away. Sara has said that she will pay it back to me and would even sign a new loan. The trouble is that I don\u2019t believe her. She has borrowed money before and never paid it back \u2013 not because she doesn\u2019t want to, but because she can\u2019t afford to. She struggled with money living with Mom \u2013 so it is going to be even worse for her without Mom paying bills in the house as well. If I don\u2019t file a claim \u2013 I will be out $37K \u2013 and that is far more than I want to hand over as a gift \u2013 even to my sister.\n\nI\u2019ve told John and Sara that I am officially filing a claim on Monday morning. They are both calling me a greedy asshole and telling me that I am ignoring what Mom wanted. I think it's unreasonable to expect me to just forget $37K.  AITA?",

Several people have made outstanding points, like getting a new contract or a lien against the house, you absolutely will not hear out a single word of it, just repeatedly saying she will not pay and I\u2019ll never see the money. That\u2019s where contracts and liens come in, they are literally there to protect you. \n3. You state you are QUITE financially stable right now and that you do not need this money right this second, but you\u2019re also unwilling to help find any workarounds for your sister and her MULTIPLE children, you\u2019re happy to make her homeless. \n4. You CLAIM that you and John are willing to give her your shares but are unsure if the other siblings will. But that it could also screw with the benefits she HAS TO HAVE to take care of her child so you all are willing to essentially hold onto it and what, give her as you see fit? And the other two siblings - who realistically shouldn\u2019t be getting a dime but will if you do this - have said nothing about THEIR shares. \n5. You are willing to make your sister and her children homeless over money that you are not in dire need of right this minute. \n\nNo one in their right mind is telling you you should walk away from 37k and just be fine with that. But they are telling you to take a step back and find out all the information before jumping and you have zero interest in doing that, OR accepting the judgement you requested when it\u2019s not going your way.",

I suppose that answers who the assholes are.\n\nThis is just a shitty situation, and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019d say that you file the claim and accept equity in the house as payment instead (a good amount over the presumed value of the remaining debt, like 30% vs the 20% represented by your $37K/$180K). I can\u2019t remember if it was you or a commenter who said the house will eventually be lost to unpaid taxes\u2026 in that case, wouldn\u2019t the house still be put up for sale and the remaining profit from the house (after back taxes and fees) be paid to the owners? That should settle your debt. Imagine if that happened and you HAD forgiven the debt. Your sister would have all this money from the house sale and you\u2019d be out all your money.\n\nYou could even add something that says you get priority rights to any sale revenue in the event it\u2019s somehow not enough to cover your debt.\nI suppose you could even put something in writing to allow you to take over full ownership in the house if taxes go unpaid and you choose to bail it out. Then you could be the generous sibling by letting your sister stay in the house while keeping an investment instead of losing your money and essentially giving it to your sister.\n\nObviously, a lawyer should get involved, but I think equity in the house is the only reasonable solution to this dilemma. It allows you to maintain some of your investment while allowing your sister a place to live. It could still go horribly wrong (like when some big maintenance bill happens and she asks you to pay for it), but at least you\u2019re delaying the problem and, again, maintaining ownership of an asset to cover your debt.",
