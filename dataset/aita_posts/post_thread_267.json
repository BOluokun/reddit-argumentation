  "post content": "My 18 yr old daughter, Meg, is in college. She moved in with her boyfriend a few months ago, which left her old bedroom empty. \n\nHer bedroom used to be right next to our tiny living room. To make our tiny living room into a normal sized living room, we knocked out my daughter's room's wall, refloored the space and fixed the walls. Now it looks like the bedroom was never there and we have a spacious living room.\n\nWhen my daughter came home to visit and saw that her room is gone, she made a huge deal about it. She got all emotional and said if we never wanted to let her move back, we should've just said so instead of completely demolishing her room.\n\nI told her that if anything happens and she needs to move back, we will welcome her and she could sleep on the couch as long as she wants. But she accused us of wanting to get rid of her forever and for her to never visit us since we got rid of her room so fast, only a few months after she moved out and we should've waited longer.\n\nAITA for not waiting longer with the renovation?",

The older of the two youngest is turning 14, and even though they don't seem to mind too much about sharing with their 11-year-old sibling, I can see that it's time to allow them their own space.\n\nCase in point: Even I know that removing a child's \"safe\" space at home requires a tender touch.  You're not a bad parent for wanting to do a home remodel, YTA for not realizing that your child still considers their old bedroom as a safe space, a place of refuge if things go wrong and they want to come home.  You just erased their existence with no notice. \n\nThe minimum that OP should have done was discuss their plans so their daughter had time to adjust to the idea, while knowing that even without a bedroom, they are always welcome home.",

My mom has always been a \"if it isn't being used, get it the fuck out\" type of person.
