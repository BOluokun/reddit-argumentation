It's a fairly large addition so it's taking some time but shouldn't be any longer than a few more weeks. We have been crashing on my sister's large sectional in the living room. We pay for the food in the house (that's all my sister wanted from us). Hotels or Airbnb's aren't an option (due to the season- you're looking at $200+ a night). \n\nWell, we just found out 2 weeks ago that my wife is pregnant. She's 18 weeks (she had no symptoms and was still menstruating). It's a lot to process, considering we were told she couldn't have kids. My wife isn't taking it too well (fear mostly), especially because we are sleeping on the couch and there's zero privacy. I mean, these guys wake up at 6am and bring their dogs downstairs and they jump all over us and then we essentially get kicked out of the living room so my wife isn't sleeping very well, if at all. \n\nWell, yesterday my wife had an absolute meltdown because she is \"fucking tired\" of the dogs. All of them. One of the dogs even so much as goes near her and she is pissed because the dogs here have no boundaries and she's tired of being touched/followed. So I was like \"well why don't you take off for the day and go get a hotel for the night so you can sleep\". She does what I suggest. About an hour later I get a call from my sister saying \"I never fucking agreed to watch your dog so you need to come get her\". I guess I just assumed my wife would have taken the dog with her until I got out of work and then we would switch off or something and I would take the dog when I was out of work. So I call and say \"hey my sister wants you to go get the dog and I will just grab her after I'm out of work\". She immediately got pissed. \"So much for me getting a fucking break from the animals, huh? Pretty useless suggestion if you expected me to take your dog with me. I'm going to my mom's for the foreseeable future.\" She hangs up and won't answer my calls. AITA?\n\nETA: to clear up confusion, my sister has 3 dogs and then my wife and I have 1 dog. Our dog is a bit of a follower so her behaviors have sucked since being at my sister's.",

If she wanted to have privacy and to not deal with your sister\u2019s animals she probably shouldn\u2019t have agreed to this arrangement. But, she is pregnant and pregnancy hormones suck. And your sister had a really strong reaction for it just being a few hrs and you\u2019d been living there all this time. I bet it\u2019s wearing on her too.\n\nAnd you need to step up. You should not have assumed. This dog is your responsibility too and it shouldn\u2019t be unlearning all of it\u2019s good habits. And you need to be a more gracious guest and husband.

You underwent this project without a plan for somewhere for you two adults and your dog to safely stay where all of your needs are met. And now you're seeing the cost of that decision. \n\nYou could take out all the details about pregnancy and dogs and you'd still be sleeping on the couch at another person's house - that gets old for everyone. The conflict would be the same. I'd show some understanding to your sister who opened her house. I'd give yourself some grace for being in a stressful situation. Show everyone and yourself some empathy for where they're coming from and work it out from there. If your sister does not want to watch your dog without you there, then listen to that. If you didn't discuss it before you agreed to stay there, consider the consequences of not communicating and figure it out now.\n\nI've had to leave my house unexpectedly when a company was doing some work at my house and didn't communicate how the work would impact our home life over a couple weeks. Packing my family and dogs and finding places in short notice was not fun but we are adults who live with the impacts of our decisions and figure it out.
