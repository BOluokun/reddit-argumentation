  "post content": "\nMe F35 and my exhusband M37 got separated 1 year ago, we share custody of our 15 yo daughter.\n\nMy exhusband has her for certain days, and his birthday didn't fall on one of these days. In fact, it fell on one of the days where my daughter is supposed to be with me. He called me so we could discuss letting him have my daughter on the day of his birthday but I told him no because it is not his day to have her, he got my daughter involved and she said she really wants to go but I said no because I have my reasons. My exhusband dropped it but on the day of his birthday, I went to pick my daughter up from school but I discovered that he came and took straight to the restaurant where his birthday party was taking place. I was fuming I called him but he didn't pick up, I then called my daughter and she said she was with him. I used location feature to track her phone and got the address.\n\n\nI showed up and interrupted the party, My exhusband started arguing with me but I told he had no consent to have my daughter with him that day but he said my daughter wanted to be there for his birthday. My former MIL tried to speak to me and I told her to stay out of it then told my daughter to grab her stuff cause we were going home. My exhusband and family unloaded on me and I tried to ignore them and just leave but my daughter made it hard for me. I took her home eventually and grounded her for agreeing to leavd school with her dad when it wasn't his day. Her dad called me yelling about how bitter and spiteful I was to deprive my daughter from attending his birthday, I told him it's basic respect and boundaries but he claimed it was just me being spiteful and deliberately hurtful towards him that I didn't even care how it affected my daughter. I hung up but more of his family members started blasting me on social media saying I showed up and made a scene at the restaurant. Went as far as calling me 'unstable'.",

But once he did, you should have left her and dealt with it afterwards.\n\nAll you're accomplishing now is alienating your daughter. She's 15 and enjoying her time with dad. Let her.\n\nEDIT thank you kind redditors for the awards and votes!",

Asking where I am going and who I am with is a given that all parents should ask for, and I agree with tracking a phone to an extent. In my eyes, it should be used in an emergency and not to see if I'm lying where I am going. My parents do pay for my phone, so it makes sense. Just sometimes it's nice to have privacy and to be trusted to where I am going, without being tracked.\n(And to those who say that being a teen I must be more tech savvy than my parents, I am not, I got this phone at 18 and before that had a flip phone that I named Chris (: )",

And many require a lot of hoops to even get the child on the stand to testify at all. The reason for that is that it's going to create animosity no matter what the child says, they are going to be forced into a position of needing to disappoint one, if not both parents. It's also extremely rare for a parent to have all contact severed, so that child is then still having visits with the parent they maybe had to say bad things about.\n\nBut all that being said, Judges, though they don't officially condone it, understand that as the child ages they are going to \"vote with their feet.\" With a 3 year old that is refusing to go, you can just put them in their car seat and drive them over. With a teenager, you cannot. So motions to enforce the parent child contact schedule will then fall on deaf ears as the kids age, unless there is an actual concern for the child's wellbeing, e.g. the child isn't going to school, safety concerns, being left alone, etc.",

Dad could still get her to OP to exercise the overnight while having the daughter there to celebrate, too. Both sides win. OP should have honored both. Not a hill I\u2019d die on.\n2. OP is flying too close to the sun. The daughter is 15, and in many states a kid can decide which parent they want to be with by the age of 14. If OP continues to embarrassed and track down her daughter, OP might find herself with fewer overnights with her daughter. OP needs to tread lightly.",

For 10 years running we went on holiday for 2 weeks over the August bank holiday, whole family shin dig always 12+ of us and it was always my partners birthday while we were there.

The holiday week wasn\u2019t his weekend but he was mad because he wanted them for his birthday and he wants to take them on holiday. so I just let them go visit with their dad instead, I don\u2019t want to be an asshole about it. He left them with his mum that weekend and went out partying, told them there is no holiday because he\u2019s just got veneers and they\u2019re expensive!! so he took their holiday away for nothing, just to spite me and my family, probably because we always had the best time and he wasn\u2019t a part of it anymore. \n\nThe separation was his idea and I didn\u2019t fight it, I think he thought I would and maybe was hurt that I didn\u2019t, and that we\u2019re all doing good and still having fun without him. \n\nThe same as this batshit lady shit talking around her daughter it\u2019s called parental alienation and it\u2019s really damaging for kids, also they see right through it.

My daughter loves her aunt and cousin so I let her go to her dad's that day to spend time with her family. Because it is what was best for my daughter and what she wanted. OP sounds incredibly petty, cruel and selfish. You always put your kids first, it's your responsibility as a parent to put your kids before your own stupid issues and problems. You hurt your daughter to hurt your ex husband and that is beyond selfish and disgusting. The \"reasons\" she had were to hurt her ex, that's it. You are the biggest asshole OP. I feel so bad for your kid Jesus Christ, you should be ashamed of yourself. Also your kid shouldn't be grounded for listening to her dad. This whole situation put her in a horrible position. I doubt she felt like she could say no to her dad as she felt she had to listen to him cause he's her freaking father.

That\u2019s her father and she wanted to spend his birthday with him. You don\u2019t like him, so you turned up and caused a scene. \n\nYou don\u2019t care about your daughters wellbeing at all. You only care about being spiteful. I really hope your daughter posts on Reddit one day and is given advice to fully move in with her dad. She\u2019s old enough to make that decision. \n\nBefore I sign off - a custody agreement is for the benefit of the child. The courts keep in mind wants best for the child. Usually they want both bio parents involved in the child\u2019s life in some way as it\u2019s *usually* the best ( maybe not in this case because you harm your child). Do not for a second think the custody agreement is about you",

The custody agreement is for the child\u2019s best interest - so SHE get optimal time with each parent, including holidays and other special occasions. How would you feel if Christmas (or another holiday important to you) fell on your ex\u2019s regular week for several years and he refused to let you see your daughter? Yep, you\u2019d be livid. My agreement with my ex has our birthdays built in, so the kids can come celebrate with us even if they\u2019re at the other\u2019s house. \n\nIdgaf what your \u201creasons\u201d are for not wanting her to go, unless your ex is a huge abuser, YTA.",
