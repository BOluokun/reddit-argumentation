  "post content": "This is a throwaway account. I am F35 and have a 16 year old daughter. My daughter has a late birthday (early/mid December), so she is going into her senior year of high school. She is a very smart girl and I'm proud of what she's accomplished. But she's also young and naive in a lot of ways.\n\nShe's easily manipulated. She doesn't pay much attention to her surroundings. She can't stand up for herself. She constantly still calls or texts myself and her father for help with things.\n\nMore recently,  I've also been concerned about her doing dangerous things or submitting to peer pressure from her 'friends'. I've met them and they are not good kids. I've told her to stop talking to them but she refuses and tries to go behind my back.\n\nFor these reasons (among others), her father and I have decided that we are not going to let her go off to college as long as she's a minor under our care. This means that she won't be going in fall ~~2025~~ 2024 because she doesn't turn 18 until that December. I am not trying to stifle her, but I do want her to be safe.\n\nShe was recently talking about starting to fill out college applications and I told her not to bother. I explained that we weren't letting her go until she's old enough to make that decision for herself. She started crying and yelling at me but I refused to budge. I don't think I'm being unreasonable and honestly her reaction is more evidence of immaturity. But apparently she texted her Aunt who has been calling me an asshole. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: fall 2024, not fall 2025.\n\nEdit 2: people seem to think that I will not allow her to go to college at all. I am absolutely willing to let her go to college once she's 18 and we will pay for it, wherever she wants to go (we have the means).",

She can take extra courses in things she's interested in and really figure out what she wants to major in with no pressure. There's no student housing, so you aren't thrust into a co-living situation with people who are likely older than you and just off the leash. Community college gets you out of taking a lot of the stressful standardized tests, so you can hone your study skills and basic prerequisites, and get the hang of student life, and when you're ready to transfer you just apply with your transcripts. It saves a lot of money and stress, and my Community College professors were some of the best teachers I had. Who knows, maybe she takes a few classes and decides college ain't it for her, and maybe she would thrive at a trade school.\n\nIf it were my kid, I'd really try to sell Community College with the points listed above. Most importantly, explain that no employer on earth (unless they're NASA, perhaps) looks sideways at Community College credits. One caveat is that some people make a career out of Community College if they're getting a free ride from the parents, so I would also try to guide her towards choosing a goal, knowing that she can make changes to it as she learns more about herself. She's gotta get used to the idea of taking the reins and leaving the nest at some point. There's still time to guide her towards making her own choices.\n\nETA: I met a lot of really cool, interesting older people in Community College. I would be willing to bet she will too, and her possibly-janky high school kid friends will start to seem really immature and unmotivated. Again, since she wouldn't be living on campus and attending Frat parties, it lessens her exposure to potentially dangerous scenarios.",

My parents had me in montessori school until I was 7 and I was nearly held back an extra year in first grade because my writing wasn\u2019t good enough, but I caught up quickly. My brother\u2019s birthday is in December and he did not go to montessori. My parents decided to enter him into kindergarten a year early because it fit their working schedules better. My brother graduated HS at 17 and and started college at 18, and seems to be infinitely more stressed by the whole concept despite being closer to home & not in dorms. Covid also played a role in his education being cut short right before he graduated. I honestly believe at 19 I was a lot more prepared for the world and for what college wanted from me than I ever would have been at 17. Adding in mental health struggles, more time is always better in my opinion. Being older than your peers does give you a slight sense of separation, as in all my friends graduated the year before me, but overall the extra time gave me a breather to think logically about what I wanted to do, and allowed me to get my shit together before taking on the giant next step that was expected of me. Hope this helps!\n\nEdit to add some more anecdotal advice, but I have several friends who really, really struggled in high school and ended up getting their GED\u2019s start college around 20/21, and have done exceedingly well, honestly better than me. They\u2019ll be graduating next year. More time is sometimes better.",

She was very smart, both academically and socially, so we decided to go for it. (Plus, financials came into play as well-- it made a big difference financially to pay for another year of daycare.) She's currently making her way through elementary school with awesome grades, and living her best life. It's possible she would do \"better\" had we waited, but I feel like she would've been bored to be a year older in the grade. \n\nIn general, the best advice is usually to wait, but you can ask the school about your specific questions.

Is OP planning on paying fully for college if their kid isn\u2019t going to get to use the scholarships she\u2019s earned?",

But if she\u2019s too \u201cimmature\u201d for a dorm (LOL) she\u2019s probably not allowed to go backpacking in Europe. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to make a choice that puts your kid in this position, you need to make it a super attractive alternative. OP should have redshirted this kid back in kindergarten. We have a January baby and are planning to do that, because the alternative is shit like this.",
