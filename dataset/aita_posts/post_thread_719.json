  "post content": "I (23F)  got invited to my cousin's engagement more than 5 month back.I am not close to any of my extended family I see them maybe once in two three years.\n\nFive months back my mum ANNOUNCED I will be a bridesmaid at my cousin's wedding.I immediately said no . I was not close to my cousin.\nA) I haven't seen her more than once or twice in my entire life.  \nB) It was a huge financial commitment and I didn't have the money or inclination to spend anything \nC) I genuinely wasn't interested\n\nHowever,  my mother was really upset and soon my aunt got involved as well. I agreed when my grandpa called me and told me to do this for him and I wouldn't have to do anything besides show up. \n\nMonths passed and I soon forgot all about it until THE dress arrived . More specifically , my bridesmaid dress.It is hideous to put it lightly. It is shocking pink , has lace and multi coloured sequins BOTH. It is also one size too small so I look like a flat chested racoon . I am not a clotheshorse , I hate spending money on clothes and as long as it's comfortable I am okay with anything . But this was too much\n\nI would have sucked it up and done it as my dad put it but I'm the only bridesmaid ( the other two backed out ) and there are three groomsmen\n\nI suggested an alternate dress but was immediately shot down . The dress is big and poofy and the bride is wearing a really simple gorgeous strapless dress . Id look like Godzilla standing next to her\n AITA if I back out ?\n\nP.S. - My aunt paid for the dress and got really upset when I suggested wearing what I had .",

Ugly brides maid dresses aren't exactly an unknown phenomenon and learn to shut family down when you're not interested.",

(OP mentioned she is not close to her cousin, and I'm guessing that if the two other bridesmaids have dropped out of the wedding, they probably weren't the bride's BFFs... or at least aren't anymore.)",
