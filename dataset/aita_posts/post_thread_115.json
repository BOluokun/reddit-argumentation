  "post content": "My uncle 53 is a complete asshole. He is vulgar and rude. He positively delights in being as offensive s possible. My grandmother says it's from a brain injury when he was young. I have never seen proof of this. My dad 50 has put up with this his whole life. \n\nWhen I asked him about it he just says that is the way his brother is and always has been. \n\nMy mom basically banned him from our house when I was growing up so I only saw him at family events. At weddings where he would say the groom looked like a f**, or that the bride looked pregnant. Thanksgiving where he would tell offensive jokes at the table. Or a birthday party where he said the food tasted like shit. \n\nI M27 recently bought a house with my girlfriend 23.  It is small and needs work but we can afford it with a lot of help from our families and the bank.\n\nWe had a housewarming this weekend and had a BBQ. It was the first time we could host a big group as I only had a bachelor apartment and my girlfriend lived with her dad.  \n\nMy dad invited my uncle, I did not. \n\nMy uncle shows up and starts being himself. He starts calling my home a shit hole and asks my girlfriend why she is with a loser like me. \n\nI ask him to come out in the front yard to talk for a second and I read him the riot act.  I do not give a shit that other people have coddled him his whole life. If he cannot be civil then he is welcome to GTFO. \n\nI was not quiet. I'm pretty sure everyone in my back yard could hear me telling him to behave like a fucking civilized adult. \n\nHe left, but spent the rest of the day texting everyone there including his mom, my grandmother, and saying that it's not his fault that I overreacted to his behaviour. It put a damper on the party. His family are kind of on his side. But my mom's family and my friends are backing me. \n\n AITA?",

It caused him to develop explosive anger, among other things, I'm sure, that I wasn't made aware of. I was 17 when they dated. I remember Thanksgiving that year, I was sick as hell, but was crawling out of bed hungry and planning on getting a bit to eat and to say hi to the family. I wear hearing aids, but my ear canals were a bit swollen and I didn't put them in. I was almost at the door when I heard this guy slamming the table and YELLING at my mom over something. I heard him clear as day, WITH my being hard of hearing, and after a bit, my uncle got involved and yelled back in defense of my mom. Nobody else had the balls to, myself included. I was standing at the door shaking. I'd never heard ANYONE yell like that before, much less a full grown man. Dude stormed out of the house a few minutes later and it was a solid 10 before I felt comfortable leaving my room. Thankfully nobody was hurt, but mom was in her room crying. Dude has a brain injury, but he was still responsible for blowing up like that. He was still responsible for berating my mom, and he owed (and gave) her a sincere apology, which she accepted, but still broke up with him. She didn't wanna be treated like that, and she DEFINITELY didn't want to see her kids treated like that, especially after her cousin saw my face ten minutes later and said she'd never seen a teenager so terrified. \n\nThere are still consequences for behaving like that, as there should be. You can't allow that kind of abusive behavior to be acceptable or you have AH's like OP's uncle who think it's funny to be so cruel.",

I'm only human and I slip up. It's also hard work to keep filtering them from my internal mind and some get through and turn into intrusive thoughts. \n\nThat's why they're not actually true to who we really are.

We actually understand an incredible amount about the brain and have developed treatments and techniques to address so many different conditions and injuries that neurology underwent a major renaissance just like trauma care and transplantation care did post 9/11.\n\nThe reality is that the uncle likely never received quality care or the grandmother never pursued it due to the time period the uncle was likely injured. The first SSRI on the market was introduced in 1987 and evidence for using them to help treat various brain injuries didn't start appearing until about 15 years later.",
