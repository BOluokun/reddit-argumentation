  "post content": "For context: I 39, got married to my wife \"Nelly\" 36, months ago. I have to say that Nelly and my daughter (her stepdaughter) \"Megan\" 16, never gotten along. They have lots of disagreements and nothing in common and it was obvious since the first say they met but I didn't do anything about it thinking they'd move past their differences and warm up to each other the longer they spend time together. I was wrong because once we moved in together the fights got worse. Nelly would complain from Megan throwing away stuff of her's just because she thought it didn't belong there. It's been basically a mouse and cat game and I've lost track on who's right and who's wrong. I did try tk establish some boundaries to try to bring back peace to my home and had them agree that each stays in their own lane and not bother each other. Nelly said that I was wrong tk think that what Megan is doing is okay but I told her to let it slide.\n\n\nNelly has especial type of haircare products for her sensitive hair. Shampoo, conditioner etc etc. She put them in the bathroom but Megan ended up throwing them away saying that Nelly had no right to store her products in the bathroom cause it's not her house. To keep the peace I asked Nelly to just keep her stuff in the bedroom and take it with her whenever she wants to take a shower to which she agreed.\n\nLast night Nelly took a shower and forgot her hair products in the bathroom. Megan ended up going in there and then the shampoo collection was gone. Nelly freaked out and then had a fight after Megan told her she dumped them out saying she already warned her about leaving her stuff laying around in the bathroom. Nelly broke down and when I said I choose to stay out of this because of how petty it was, she blew up at me. She yelled about how I keep letting Megan get away with bad attitude and unjustified misbehavior. Told me to stop enabling her and start setting consequences for her actions. I told her she shouldve been more careful knowing how Megan is so I feel like this was preventable. but she said that she forgot her stuff there and didn't think Megan would go that far.\n\nWe had an argument and that was it. Megan is acting nonchalant sdespite me talking to her and Nelly went tj stay with her parents saying I need to step up and do something.",

I've always had mental health issues (since age 6 at least), but I became crippled with anxiety and depression in that marriage.  Finally, after she (step-daughter) threatened to kill me, I left.  No one in the house cared and they acted like it was certainly an empty threat.  I'd have agreed if she hadn't been so specific about how and when she was going to do it.\n\nWithin about 6 months to a year of leaving, I was me again.  I no longer have such bad anxiety and depression.\n\nI am even friends with my ex-stepdaughter now that she is an adult and has matured a lot.  There were about 4 years from the time I left until we talked again, but it was one of the best things to happen to me in a long time when we reconnected!
