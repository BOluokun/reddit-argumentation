  "post content": "Shared building, with myself in the downstairs in-law and 3 women in the main portion of the house. Around 9pm the other night I hear the \"eeeh-ur eeeh-ur\" of the mattress and it's pretty obvious someone upstairs is doing the old, pardon the vague euphemism, penis-in-vagina-intercourse. I occupy myself elsewhere where i can't hear it, and when the sounds have been absent for awhile, I text \"Not to be crass or make anyone self-conscious, but before the next sexy-time, that mattress needs some serious de-squeaking. I've left some WD40 at the bottom of the basement stairs :)\" to all 3 girls above, as I'm not sure who's doing what (not like it matters). And I did leave an old bottle of WD40 out with the mail on the basement steps, not in a cheeky way but as a genuine solution to said problem. Total acquaintance-relationship with all 3; they do their thing and I do mine, and paths rarely cross. We share some communal things like laundry, mail distribution, and trash/recycling, but separate entrances and we don't interact socially. \n\n The next day I receive this as a response \"That was incredibly crass and intrusive the other night. Please put on headphones next time.\"  What am I missing, or do/didn't do to make me an asshole, or is said responsee being an A-hole. Genuine question; not morally high-grounding or trying to call someone one. Thanks in advance for any opinions.",
