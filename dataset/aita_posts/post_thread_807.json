I don\u2019t know how it is outside the U.S but the ACT is a standardized test that takes roughly 3-4 hours to see if you\u2019re worthy to got to college.

My sister an I start talking about the best way to study. She\u2019s on the side that I should do it untimed so I can build up my skills sooner rather than later. I said that I should do it timed that way I can establish a baseline and that all the teachers I\u2019ve talked to agree. But before I can explain that, I get interrupted.\n\nDad decided that we\u2019re getting to loud and that\u2019s disrespectful.\n\nHe starts talking about how, once again, my sister is right. She took the ACT so she knows what she\u2019s doing. He stops so I try and finish my point.\n\nDad: I wasn\u2019t finish talking but ok\n\nSo I stop everything I\u2019m saying.\n\nMe: what was that you said?

I could have killed a man and he would have been calmer about it.\n\nDad: Don\u2019t you f*%^ing talk to me like that I am your father and you don\u2019t talk to me like that.\n\nMe: why shouldn\u2019t I? \n\nDad: I\u2019m your dad that\u2019s why. \n\nWe go on a long argument about respect and how I should learn it.\n\nDad: I gave you what I can give and you talk to me like this.\n\nMe: what have you given me? Anxiety? Depression? Thank a f*%#ing lot for that. \n\nDad: you know what I\u2019m done with this. You\u2019re gonna get a 13 (very low for the ACT) and I\u2019m going to f*%#ing laugh.\n\nHe gets up. He takes my phone and he walks away.\n\nMy sister is on my side about how dad has treated me.

The \u201cyou should respect me because I\u2019m your father\u201d argument was also very common to him. I actually had a failed suicide attempt largely due to how he treated me, so trust me, I get how you can be feeling.\n\nGenerally speaking, his behavior is pretty crappy so he\u2019s an AH here. While he\u2019s likely provided a lot for you, that doesn\u2019t give him excuse to treat you like an object he owns.\n\nHowever, your snarky comments also make you a bit of an AH as well. I did the same thing, and for me it developed over time as a mechanism for coping with him being overly controlling and acting like a toddler. Not sure how much you can relate to this, but for me It was an underlying thought of \u201cwell if I treat him with respect, nothing changes. If I actually disrespect him maybe he\u2019ll notice.\u201d In hindsight, that behavior only made the rift grow wider. I don\u2019t blame you here, but at this point you\u2019ve basically just got to take your lumps and then when you turn 18 and move out, just go your separate ways. \n\nSorry for going on a bit of a tangent, but what I wish I would\u2019ve learned is that you can\u2019t control how your dad acts, you can only control how you act. Just don\u2019t really argue with him, but the trade off for him is that he is harming his relationship with you. Eventually, he may learn that once you become an independent adult, you don\u2019t have to come back and respect him \u201cbecause he\u2019s your father.\u201d Respect has to be earned.",
