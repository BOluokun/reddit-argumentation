  "post content": "I am 19M, and my sister (22F) got married about a week ago. She was rather mean to me growing up, and I still don't like her very much.\n\nSeveral months ago, we were all having dinner as a family. I was asked by my sister if I could be the organist for her wedding. She told me that she can't pay me, but that I can have food at the buffet. Since most of the gigs that I do are paying ones, I initially said that she's going to have to pay me. But my parents got mad at me and told me that it's unreasonable to expect family to pay me for playing music. I asked my sister if there'll be vegan options for her buffet, and she told me that she'll make sure that there will be. So I gave in and agreed to play as long as she has vegan options for me.\n\nWhen I arrived on the day of the wedding, my sister came over and told me that she wasn't able to get any vegan options for the buffet, so she got an Impossible Whopper for me from Burger King on her way there. Not only was that completely insulting, it has mayo in it so it isn't even vegan. I told her that I'm not going to play for the wedding unless she sends me $200 on Venmo right now. She went and discussed it with her fianc\u00e9, only to be told that she can't do that. So I immediately left the wedding and muted my sister, her fianc\u00e9, and my parents on my phone. There was no music for the wedding ceremony. I went to go see a movie with my friends instead.\n\nWhen I got home, my parents were predictably very angry and screaming at me. But I refused to apologize. I honestly don't care that much what they think anymore at this point because I'm already moving out in less than a month. My sister is now demanding that I reimburse her $2500 for the organ rental, and is threatening to take me to small claims court. I told her to pound sand because not only was there no contract, she didn't even uphold her end of our verbal agreement.",

My sister is vegan and you'd best believe at my wedding she would be sitting at the head table with something delicious to eat, just like everybody else. This leads me to think the family can't be that close, and to expect him to play for free was crossing a line. That said, while I would have been absolutely pissed, I don't know if storming out was the right call, but then I go back to thinking how hungry he must have been and that alone would cause me to overreact. I think my judgment is NTA, or maybe ESH but where sucking is mostly on the part of the sister who kind of sounds like a monster to me. If I was OP I would have stayed and then come up with some petty revenge plot for later that ruins her day, but not her wedding day. Tough situation.",

Menu's for weddings are set months in advance, she knew her standard buffet didmt have the right food and didnt cate about him enough to make the proper arrangements (and im not talking about fast food, thats insulting too even if shed gotten no mayo).

He told her to get bent and it was pretty unanimously nta. If a *dying person* isn't entitled to help, what on earth makes someone getting married so god damn important the deserve free labor? Get real. \n\n\"Think of it as a gift.\" Yes, i totally want to give someome who bullied me growing up and has no respect for me (see: wont feed and wont pay) a gift of my time and talent. \n\nHe didn't ruin her day, she did. She presumably didnt even invite her to her wedding considering there was *no food he could eat there.*, she asked him to come play for free. He said no and he got guilted into it. All he wanted was some food, but she couldn't be arsed to do it. \n\nI also really love how you bring up \"most brides dont get food on their wedding day.\" You couldn't be more wrong. I used to work at an upscale event for weddings, i cant count how many weddings I've done, but durring the spring and summer we had at least 4 weddings a week, and some weekends wed do 2 a day, so multiply that by 3 years and thats how many weddings ive seen. People get to the venue hours, HOURS before the ceremony. They get hungry and they order  food. Sometimes its finger sandwiches and mimosas, but usually they have one of the brides maids run out and grab something for everyone. Taco bell, bk, McDonald's, whatever the bride wants. Its usually greasy because 9 times out of 10 everyone is hung over from the rehearsal dinner. \n\nShe manipulated him into playing for food, she knew all along what was going to be offered because *she made the fucking menu.* you're aware that the couple choose the food right? Especially if its buffet style lol. \n\nThis is so insane to me.",
