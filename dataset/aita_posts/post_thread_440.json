  "post content": "This is literally really stupid but she's really upset about it. So my (48) daughter (23) has a blue tongue skink who she heavily adores. She jokingly refers to it as her daughter, I've found it weird but she says it's because it's the closest thing she'd have to a child and she feels a strong emotional bond similar to a child. She has decided to remain child free for multiple reasons and I have been very supportive of this decision.\n\nWell she recently took her Skink to the vet for a checkup and she was excited to find out her Skinks gender. Afterwards I got a text asking if I'd come to her gender reveal party she was having. She explained it was just a small get together with cake and food for her friends she hasn't seen in a while with the gender reveal being mostly a joke (and a way to make fun of real gender reveals).\n\nWell I didn't come. I didn't see a point. It's just a lizard and I'm a busy person. She later called me and expressed she was kind of sad I didn't come cuz it'd been a while since I'd seen her but she understood I was busy. I told her she couldn't actually expect me to come to a gender reveal for a lizard. She said that it wasn't a real gender reveal, that was more of a joke and it was really just a small gathering to catch up with everyone. I told her if that was the case she should've just called it a gathering because I'm not coming to a gender reveal unless it's for a real grand daughter.\n\nShe got quiet for a minute and then turned my words around, claiming I wasn't supportive of her decision to be childfree. I told her she can't possibly expect me to treat a lizard as a grand daughter, she said she didn't expect me too but it was clear I didn't respect her bond with her lizard and her decision, and she just wanted to see me and my reason for coming was hurtful. I told her she was being ridiculous over a lizard, she claimed it wasn't over the lizard and it was a gathering and not even centered around the lizard, but I stick by to what I said. It's ridiculous to have a gender reveal for a lizard.\n\nShe hung up and I got a message from her best friend about how I'm an asshole for treating her that way, but I don't think I'm the asshole for not wanting to go to a party for a lizard?  \n\n\nEDIT: In the time I was away I got many replies and it was a lot to read through. Let me clear a couple things up.\n\n1. My issue is that she said the party was a gender reveal, if she had called it just a party I would have come. But calling it a gender reveal makes it sound like it's for the lizard, and I'm not going to that even if it is a \"joke\". \n2. I don't know why it matters but the Skink is a girl which is why I said \"I'm not coming to a gender reveal unless it's for a real grand daughter.\" \n3. Even though I don't agree with my daughter for being childfree, I have been supportive and only shown mild frustration. The reasons she decided to be childfree is she claims she's asexual, she just doesn't want one, she has emotional baggage and feels unable to care for a real child, she fears pregnancy, and she has a carrier gene like me and \"doesn't want to go through what I did\" (I had 4 miscarriages and a highly defect child that died after 3 months due to the gene). Yes there has been slight tension between us because I think she just hasn't found the right man (she never dated growing up) and her other fears are unnecessarily exaggerated, but it's ultimately her decision and I don't resent her.\n4. We haven't seen each other in three months. I'm a single mother and we have always been close which is why she invited me with her friends, I just didn't want to go to a party with a lizard, and if it wasn't for the lizard she should've called it a party instead of a gender reveal.",

I wonder where she got that from. (it's you). \n\nalso, she sounds really fucking smart to me. you admit you had so many problems trying to get pregnant and that was probably very difficult.

      "content": "Ok. So. First off, this is probably the most interesting topic I've ever seen on this sub. I didn't wake up this morning thinking \"I hope I get to weigh in on how the social contract relates to gender reveal parties for reptiles\" but here we are.\n\nIf this was as straight forward as the title suggested, you wouldn't be in the wrong at all. A gender reveal party for a lizard is just...well. It's silly. Gender reveal parties in general are silly, this one is double silly. It's fun, it's cute, but it's silly.\n\nHowever.\n\nYour daughter did make it clear to you that she was jokingly hosting a gender reveal party for a lizard. What she was actually doing was hosting a small get together and she wanted you to come over. She made it pretty obvious from the ~~get-go~~  *gecko* that she really just wanted an excuse to have a small party.\n\nSo...and I love that I get to use this sentence...\n\n***Let's remove the lizard genitals from the situation.***\n\nWhat your daughter was actually doing was inviting you over to spend time with her, and you declined because you're \"A busy person with important things to do.\" You didn't like that she jokingly called it a gender reveal party, even though it had been made clear that it was just a get together. You took a stab at her choice to be child free (She's obviously not presenting this lizard as your grand daughter, it wasn't necessary to say that you'd come to a gender reveal for an actual baby). Basically, you got so hung up on the silly name of the party that you completely ignored the intention and made your daughter feel like crap.\n\nSo yeah, YTA, but it's not because you won't be there to celebrate the revealing of the lizard genitals. It's just because your daughter wanted to spend time with you, and you brushed her off Cats in the Cradle style.\n\nETA: Your edit made this entire situation worse. Congratulations. With just a few sentences, you managed to\n\n\\-Demonstrate that you were entirely hung up on the name of the party. Despite being told multiple times what the purpose of the party was, you couldn't live with attending a party with a silly name.\n\n\\-Prove that you are not, in fact, supportive of your daughter's decision to be child free. There's a difference between being \"supportive\" and \"only bitching about it a little bit\".\n\n\\- Invalidate your daughter's sexual identity. She's not asexual, she just hasn't met the right man yet!\n\nBut I think my favorite part was towards the end. Where your daughter provided multiple VERY legitimate reasons not to want children. Not wanting kids, for one. But also a fear of pregnancy, genetic issues, and a maternal history of devastating loss. You suffered 4 miscarriages and lost a child in infancy. How in the world could you, as a mother, want your daughter to suffer like that? \n\nEveryone keeps mentioning the Iranian Yogurt, but after reading your update, I'm prepared to say it.\n\n***THE LIZARD GENITALS ARE NOT THE ISSUE HERE.***",

OP stating that they wouldn't go unless it was a real gender reveal was uncalled for and wouldnt have been said unless they were salty their kid wasn't have babies (which is the case and seems like OP dislikes despite saying their supportive). OP is gonna find themselves without a daughter real soon",

Your following comment \n\n>I think she just hasn't found the right man (she never dated growing up)\n\nUmm hello!!!!  She was waiving a HUGE flag here!!  She is Asexual!  If she came out as lesbian would you say she just has not meet the right man????\n\nNext you invalidate her fears of going through the same heart break that yourself went through trying to have other kids from miscarriages to a child who passed after a so short life!  Not everyone is as emotionally stunted as you that they could speak of those situations so devoid of feeling.  I am actually tearing up thinking about what you went through and how in your small mind you wish your own surviving child would go through it as well just to pop out a kid.  \n\nGet over yourself \"Mom\", and yes quotes, because you do not deserve that title any longer.  I hope this shows your amazing Asexual daughter that her life is 1000x better with out you in it.  Also, for your sake OP, go get therapy, you need to reconnect with your emotions.",

But this sediment exists, and I deal with it for 2 hours every Tuesday. I just got back from my group, and here is this mindset on my reddit page. \n\nI would seriously consider looking into the Trevor Project and the AVEN (Asexual Visuability and Education Network) for their information on Asexuality and Aromanticism.   \n\n\nYTA.",

I will not stop being the way I am and your daughter will not stop being the way she is just because you are the way you are (presumably straight). It\u2019s time to accept diversity in the human population as a fact not a feeling. \n\nI\u2019m proud as hell of your daughter and her lizard. Good for her for being so high-empathy that she can bond to a reptile like that. The world needs more people like her. More affectionate blue-tongued girl lizards like your grandchild. And fewer like you, who can\u2019t see your way clear to loving them both. \n\nBtw I am in exactly this situation. 23f choosing to be childfree and I have a rescue pitbull who is (only slightly ironically) my daughter. And you know what my mom did? Started unironically referring to herself as a grandma. Whenever she sees my dog she asks her, \u201chow\u2019s my grandbaby!!!\u201d She just leaned in to the whole thing and she is having a fantastic time.
