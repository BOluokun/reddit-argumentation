  "post content": "I (f19) am in my first year of college, living with a roommate, Katie (f19). Katie speaks three languages (English, German and Spanish) and she makes it her whole personality. \n\nWhenever I ask what she\u2019s watching, she\u2019s watching something in another language. So obviously I can\u2019t watch it. She\u2019s always listening to music on her headphones and when I tried to bond and listen to what\u2019s she\u2019s listening, it\u2019s in another language again and I couldn\u2019t stand it. \n\nHer friends all speak one of the languages she does and whenever I hear them, I can\u2019t join the conversation because they mixing everything so I\u2019m left out of their convo.\n\nThe other day, I saw she had a new book on her desk, Portuguese coursebook. I asked her about this and she said she\u2019s taking private Portuguese classes starting February.\n\nI told her she has to let it go, that she needs to develop her personality because speaking a language isn\u2019t a personality trait and she\u2019s just boring.\n\nShe got really annoyed with me and told me I\u2019m an asshole and to stop eavesdropping on her convos.\n\nI told her she\u2019s boring and has to fake her personality.\n\nNow, she\u2019s not speaking to me.\n\nMy friends are split, some agree with me and some agree with her.\n\nWho\u2019s the asshole here? AITA for telling the truth?",

If you speak the language, it makes sense to watch movies in their original form. A lot of the nuance is lost in translation.

I have a theory: OP feels left out when they\u2019re all hanging out and Katie and her friends switch languages. And if it\u2019s happening at times when they\u2019re supposed to be hanging out together, that\u2019s actually pretty understandable (especially if it\u2019s happening a lot). And, like a lot of people (especially teenagers) OP probably hasn\u2019t learned to voice these feelings in a mature way. So OP held them in and they turned to resentment and jealousy and then lashed out about it like an AH.\n\nOP, if I\u2019m onto something, here\u2019s how you can express this: \u201cHey Katie, can I talk to you about something? I think it\u2019s really cool that you and your friends speak lots of languages. But sometimes when we\u2019re all hanging out together and you start speaking in other languages that I don\u2019t understand to each other, I feel uncomfortable and excluded because I can\u2019t participate in the conversation. I want to keep getting to know you and your friends, but it\u2019s hard when I can\u2019t really be a part of things when we\u2019re together. I totally understand that you guys would want to practice with different languages, but would you mind trying to keep things in English as much as possible when we\u2019re all hanging out so I can be part of things? I would really appreciate that.\u201d\n\nYTA for lashing out like that, so you\u2019ll have to back track and start with an apology before expressing those feelings. And if it\u2019s not even about this and you\u2019re getting upset about conversations you wouldn\u2019t even be a part of anyways cause you aren\u2019t hanging out and you\u2019re just overhearing, then you need to get over yourself.",
