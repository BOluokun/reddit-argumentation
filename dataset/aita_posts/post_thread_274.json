  "post content": "Throwaway because I have family that use Reddit as well. Next spring, I am getting married to the love of my life. We have decided that we don\u2019t want children at our wedding. Not many of our friends and family have young children, and the ones that do are fine with getting a sitter for the weekend since we gave them a lot of notice. The only ones to put up a fight are my aunt and uncle who have a daughter with autism. She is 20, but will be 21 by the time my wedding day comes around. She is what they call \u201chigh-functioning\u201d, which means she can talk and wash/dress herself, and she has some friends. She graduated from high school a couple years ago and is currently living with her parents (my aunt and uncle) while working at a grocery store. Despite her being technically an adult I just don\u2019t see her as such. Every time I talk to her at a family gathering it\u2019s like talking to a child. She is obsessed with toy ponies and barbie dolls, and brings them up at every opportunity. She draws in her notebook constantly and never makes eye contact when talking to me. She does not have loud meltdowns like other special needs kids I\u2019ve met before, but I really don\u2019t want to risk her ruining my special day. I told my aunt and uncle that I didn\u2019t want her there and they became very upset. They said she already saw the invite and knew it was child-free but because she is an \u201cadult\u201d, she thought she was still included. My aunt tried to guilt me by saying she\u2019d already picked out a dress and a gift but I didn\u2019t want to hear it. My fianc\u00e9 says I\u2019m being an asshole and we should let her attend because she has attended other weddings before with no issue. Everyone is making me feel horrible for not treating her like an adult when she doesn\u2019t act like one. AITA?",

Your cousin literally is an adult who like you said doesn\u2019t actually cause disruptions or has sensory issues that makes sitting through events like weddings hard. You have no reason to not invite her other than you not liking her. Idk frankly it sounds like you\u2019re the difficult one in the family.\n\nGo ahead and not invite her. But be warned that blaming your cousin\u2019s autism is abelist and will likely lead to a bunch of family not showing up for your \u201cbig day\u201d since they also see you as an AH. But no worries. You sound like you are someone who appreciates \u201caesthetics\u201d think of it as guest minimalism. Imagine the photos, spaced out and gaps between guests, such a vibe. \n\nOr better yet, maybe your fianc\u00e9 will get the drift and there won\u2019t be a wedding. He\u2019s already saying you\u2019re the one in the wrong. Wanna bet what will happen if you actually go through with it?",

Nothing to do with tantrums which are usually due to someone throwing a fit because they can't have a toy or something.\n\nAlso there's nothing wrong with being nonverbal? I don't see what being able to speak has to do with any of this? *I'm* at least 50% nonverbal. I'm considered partially nonverbal. Which means I'm verbal in certain situations and not in others. \n\nNonverbal doesn't mean you're sitting in a corner, staring, drooling, and rocking while making weird grunting sounds. It simply means you don't use verbal communication as your primary form of communication. Many autistic people can edge into nonverbal territory when overstimulated. It's like your brain goes 'hey there's too much going on so to process it i'm gonna make it easier by taking away your need to vocally communicate'.\n\nThere are many different ways to communicate if you are nonverbal. If I have to go to an airport or grocery store by myself, I carry a notepad and pen with me. If I need help, I write my question down and show it to a staff member. Perfectly reasonable form of communication.",
