  "post content": "Obvious throwaway because my friends use reddit. I\u2019m a 23 year old male, graduated college last year. This happened a week ago, but the girl and her boyfriend are still on rough water because of my comment. \n\nI was at a bar with my friends (fake names) Tim, Danny, Sarah, Nancy, and Erin plus her bf Scott. Erin is the \u201cfriend\u201d. I never liked her, but she\u2019s close with the rest of my friends. My family is significantly more well off than my other friends. Like i graduated with no debt because my parents paid for it. Erin had to pay her way through school. I have been nothing but nice to her my entire time knowing her, but she constantly has made comments about my parents and their money. I\u2019ll add specific things if you readers want to know, but that\u2019s not entirely relevant to the story. \n\nWhile at the bar, Erin made a comment to me about my major. I graduated with a sports management degree; which Erin loves to say is a bullshit major. I was talking to Scott and Danny about my job aspirations in the field, and Erin chimed in saying \u201chow lucky I am to be able to pursue anything I want and not have to pick a \u2018real\u2019 major because my parents have the money to support me\u201d I told her mine and my parents finances is none of her business. She said how she \u201cwishes she had loaded parents so she go to college for something stupid, but she has to get a job that will actually make her money.\u201d\n\nI had enough, and I said \u201c yeah you\u2019re gonna make a lot more than me, because you majored in sucking dick and that business won\u2019t be affected by any recessions\u201d. She got really quiet and then told me I\u2019m a fucking douchebag. She went to the bathroom and Sarah, Nancy followed her. Scott asked me to elaborate on my comment. He wasn\u2019t mad but sounded concerned. I was done with erins shit so I was honest with him. I told him how she had been around the block more than a few times in college. Apparently, she told Scott a different story. He told me that he thought she barely ever did anything with guys (much less many one night stands) because that\u2019s what she told him. Scott ended up leaving the bar when they were in the bathroom, thanking me for exposing his girlfriend for lying to him. \n\nWhen the girls returned from the bathroom I had to explain what happened with Scott. Erin immediately started balling, her and the girls went home. I talked to Nancy the other day and she told me how Erin and Scott are having big troubles. As Scott is considering breaking up with her over all this and he hasn\u2019t seen her since. My friends Didn\u2019t really get mad at me for what I said, because they all knew as well she was lying to Scott about her past. Am I an asshole? I just had enough of her shit and fired back.",

The hell is wrong with everyone?\n\nHer bf is an ass too. Who the fuck cares if she fucked a whole neighborhood? Her relationships past don't affect her current one. Having multiple partners or one night stands says you like sex but it doesn't mean she's a cheater or anything negative. Part of being young in college is getting laid. And that's fine for all genders. He's of course allowed to be uncomfortable about it, but he should really self examine exactly _why_ it makes him uncomfortable. \n\nAnd for basically the same reasons you're an ass too. You wanted to hurt her because she hurt you. But to do it you leveraged a garbage double standard. If it weren't for that double standard it wouldn't even be an insult.

Looking at my reasons I just realized I was being insecure. Maybe the cheating thing is valid, since part of cheating is sleeping around. But there's always other signs more indicative of that. Usually in how they treat others in general. I've never met a cheater who's otherwise a great person. Met lots that are pretty good at hiding those flaws though. \n\nEh just something to think about.\n\nEdit\nJust the part where she lied about her past. Dishonesty is a valid reason to break up with someone since trust is integral to a relationship. I wouldn't consider him an AH for that.",
