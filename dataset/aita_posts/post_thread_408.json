  "post content": "This happened in Oct and my daughter is still acting cold and Hardly speaking to me. \n\nMy daughter (F16) works an after school job 5 days a week. Her high school had a costume contest for Halloween. My daughter and her friends planned a group costume to enter. She went with her friends after school to buy costumes. \n\nI picked her and her friends up from the store and they showed me their costumes. My daughter spent 80$ on hers. I was pissed that\u2019s a lot of money to spend on something your going to wear for a few hours. Very irresponsible use of money. I told her as much in the car told her it was ridiculous. I dropped her friends off and took her back to the store to return the costume and accessories. \n\nHer friends found someone eles to take her place in the group and they won the contest and a 100$ visa gift card to split. My daughter came home from school on Halloween upset she claimed she had to sit and watch while her friends had fun and she missed out on everything. I pointed out to her after splitting the gift card it would be way less then she spent on the costume and it was only a few hours but she didn\u2019t want to listen to reason. \n\nNow a month later and she is still moody and mostly ignoring me. My ex husband told me I made her miss out and she works so much she missed out on a lot of stuff with her friends and I could have let her have this. But at the end of the day I saved her 80$. I just trying to teach my daughter how to be responsible with money she could have gotten a cheap costume especially since I she would have only worn it for a few hours.",
