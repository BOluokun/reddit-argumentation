  "post content": "\nBasically, my brother inlaw (my husband's brother) passed away from cancer 2 weeks ago. His widow/wife aka sister inlaw has never really been on good terms with my inlaws/her inlaws. They were having issues in the past and now from what I gather, my mother inlaw is planning on going to court for grandparents rights to get visitation of the kids.\n\n\nMy inlaws had been asking my sister inlaw to give them my brother inlaw's wedding ring so they could keep it. She refused and they got into a huge argument then she left with the kids. They went over to her home yesterday hoping to take the ring from her but she told them she didn't have it, and that she buried it with my brother inlaw. When my parents inlaw mentioned this and were devastated, I suggested that she might just be lying to get them to drop it. Suddenly, they got up and quickly got into their cars and went over to her house and had another huge argument there. Sister inlaw called me later cussing at me saying I was horrible to be basically meddling in her life and encouraging my inlaws to come after her and harrass her. I argued that I only made a suggestion and that her real issue was with them. She hung up after telling me to mind my own business and stop getting involved. My husband berated me for what I said and said that his parents are crazy, and that I shouldn't approve of their behavior or even help them harrass my grieving sister inlaw. I mean my parents inlaw are also grieving and I, too, am grieving and my sister inlaw's words hurt me when all I did was just make a suggestion when I saw how devastated my parents inlaw were.\n\n\nEDIT My sister inlaw and I aren't close. she seems to resent me for some reason even before this sitation took place.",

It was devastating for both of us.  My relationship with his family had been somewhat difficult since the divorce, however,  I always tried to take the high road, not stoop to their level of pettiness, as an example for my daughter. \n\nWithout her dad to maintain balance, my daughter was struggling with her relationships with her dad's family.  He had   been a bit of a safety net for her and with him gone, they were invading her privacy and imposing their viewpoints on every aspect of her life.\n\nMy daughter became extremely stressed our and wanted to limit time with her dad's family. I wanted everyone to get along, but my daughter and her needs came first.\n\nAs soon as we limited visits to special occasions and holidays, his family lost their shit,  filed for custody of my daughter,  made up a  crap-ton of lies about me, and hired a private investigator to dig up as much dirt on me as possible to assist with their court case.\n\nIt was shocking, scary,  and devastating. My daughter lost a parent and instead of being able to grieve, she had to immediately worry about losing me too, through the court proceedings. \n\nThankfully, mental health evaluations were a requirement in court for us, and the in-laws. A wonderful family mediator was selected to also interview my daughter, who at 14, had her own thoughts/feelings about her situation. \n\nLong story short(er), the mental health testing (MMPI)  revealed all of the narcissistic tendencies of my daughter's grandmother,  her need for control, etc. That, along with my daughter's conversation with the mediator, shut down the entire process and my daughter stayed with me, with minimal, supervised contact with her paternal family.

Maybe if OP offered a valid reason like the sister in law is a drug addict or something then it would make sense, but no explanation as to why the hell they think it\u2019s justified to try to take this woman\u2019s children away from her. I\u2019m so appalled from reading this. I hope OP\u2019s husband leaves her. Even he doesn\u2019t agree with his own parents in this situation...
