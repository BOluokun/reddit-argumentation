  "post content": "hi all. i\u2019m a 21 y/o female and i\u2019m not going to my brothers wedding and i need you all to tell me if i\u2019m the asshole for it. (my brother is 24)\n\nfor some backstory, i struggle with my mental health. severe anxiety, severe depression, covid-19 made that so much worse. my brother moved out of home back in 2019 and we used to be really close until he moved out, but i was also close with his now fianc\u00e9e. \n\nthey both used to text me constantly, ask me how i was doing etc etc, we used to call and even hang out, but then lockdown hit and we could only facetime/call each other. i was one of the first people told that he was proposing to her, he sent me the ring before he showed anyone else and told them, we were really close. i was also really close to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nthey got engaged, and the texts slowly faded from her side, she would only text me once a month, maybe twice, i thought \u2018oh, okay, planning a wedding, gonna be busy\u2019 and then one day the texts just stopped. i kept texting, i got no response. \n\ncome around to a year before their wedding, all of the bridesmaids are announced, and.. i\u2019m not one of them. okay, cool, it\u2019s their wedding, they can do what they want, i\u2019m genuinely not arsed. groomsmen are announced, and.. my boyfriend is a groomsman?? which is odd, because as far as i\u2019m concerned, my boyfriend and my brother have never had a one on one conversation in the entirety that i have been with him (6 years almost 7). \n\nme and my brother had a huge argument about the way he\u2019s treated me recently, no texts no calls, not being involved in the wedding whereas my partner is?? and my brother blamed it on my mental health. okay, fair one, it\u2019s a bit of a shitter but i can\u2019t *help* it, i just work around it. \n\ni recently got a new job after being laid off due to covid, i\u2019m really proud of myself and i wanted to tell my brother, he literally didn\u2019t even say \u2018i\u2019m proud of you.\u2019 he just said \u2018cool\u2019, that sucked but moving on\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc. \n\ni don\u2019t want to go to this wedding. i don\u2019t want my partner standing up there in a tie that won\u2019t match my dress. i don\u2019t want my partner having photos taken with bridesmaids all matching when i won\u2019t be. i don\u2019t want to sit in a church watching my brother get married and pretend to be happy about it when all he has done for the past year is belittle me and belittle my mental health and use that as a weapon against me. \n\nthroughout all of this, my boyfriend was hospitalised and almost died twice (he\u2019s fine now thank god) neither of them reached out to either of us to see if he was okay. his fianc\u00e9e hasn\u2019t texted me at all, hasn\u2019t replied to any of my texts or picked up my calls. \n\nAITA? i probably am, but i\u2019m just genuinely really hurt.\n\nEDIT: my boyfriend hasn\u2019t accepted the info of being a groomsman, he\u2019s basing it on how i feel because he isn\u2019t close to my brother at all and even he thinks it\u2019s weird that he was asked. \nnow i have this new job i COULD afford anything they needed to (the wedding is in a year)\n\nEDIT x2:\nthank you all for the comments, i should\u2019ve added more backstory, i guess. here\u2019s more, you change change your opinions if you want- \n\nmy parents were going though a lot last year, they were so close to divorcing which is why my brother and i were a lot closer. during the lockdown, i was my mothers confidant, she came to me with every problem about my dad and put a lot of nasty opinions in my head about him, she had no outlet so she used me, and my brother didn\u2019t think that was cool, he was concerned about my mental health which is why we\u2019re were texting a lot more. \ni was not aware that my mother was also using my brother as a confidant and when things healed up with my dad, i was still left with alot of trauma and unresolved feelings, hence the diagnosis with depression and anxiety, which in turn was a catalyst for a lot of problems with my mother. we used to argue constantly and she would text my brother (who is the GC) and like she did with me and my dad, she swayed opinions. i\u2019m not using this to justify anything at all, i am aware of how mental health affects other people and not just the person with the actual mental health issue, i am just putting this as more history as to why mine and my brothers relationship could\u2019ve become estranged. \n\nit\u2019s not just about the texting or anything, it\u2019s about the way he makes me feel. he constantly belittles me in front of the family despite knowing how much i struggle, and honestly me wondering whether i should go to the wedding is just an accumulation of everything he\u2019s ever said and done to me over the past year, i\u2019m just tired of being belittled by someone who is supposed to love me. \n\nmy brother asking my boyfriend to be a groomsman was not an olive branch, it was a deliberate dig from both him and his fianc\u00e9e, knowing that i felt upset about not being told something i already assumed (because we had had a conversation prior to him asking my boyfriend about the entire thing and he was super nasty about it) \n\nidk if any of this makes sense, but i\u2019m coming to the conclusion that IATA, and i\u2019m just gonna suck it up and go",

But declining to go now would likely create a lot of drama that isn\u2019t necessary. \n2) re: your boyfriend being asked to be a groomsman: what is telling about this is that he thinks it\u2019s weird. If he thinks it\u2019s weird, its absolutely in his right to decline. \n3) people are allowed to make decisions regarding their wedding however they want, so it is entirely fair for your brother and his fianc\u00e9 to not ask you to be in the wedding party. What is curious to me is why they didn\u2019t seem prepared for it to be hurtful to you. It seems like there\u2019s a lot more behind your relationship with them falling apart and, honestly, I think that\u2019s the real heart of the matter here. You had a close relationship with them and now you don\u2019t, but you don\u2019t know why. Take some time to reflect, possibly reach out to a therapist, and then see if you can speak with your brother about all of this. (And remember, blaming your mental health is a really easy scapegoat for both you and your brother, but it may not be at fault here)",

Other people don\u2019t spend as much time thinking about you as you think they do. \n\nI don\u2019t mean this as a slam \u2014 I\u2019ve actually found it helps with anxiety to keep that in mind. \n\n(Me: OH MY GOD I\u2019ve been wearing mismatched socks all day; everyone must think I\u2019m an idiot. \nMy husband: how many other people\u2019s socks did you notice today? \nMe: \u2026 none?\nHim: so why are you so sure everybody noticed yours? Were they fluorescent or something?) \n\nEssentially, other people aren\u2019t living their lives AT you; they\u2019re just living their lives. And sometimes that means that they get super wrapped up in other things and don\u2019t text or call as often as they used to. \n\n(Nb: there are definitely people out there who do that sort of thing as a deliberate insult, but they\u2019re the exception, not the rule.)\n\nTwo (edit - Reddit kept switching the number back to 1): Partly because of #1 and partly because people aren\u2019t mind readers, they generally don\u2019t know what kind of feedback or support you\u2019re hoping for. \n\nThere are several ways to deal with that, including\n\nA. Tell them what kind of support/feedback you want\n\nB. Don\u2019t tell them and accept that they\u2019re going to miss the mark sometimes\n\nC. Don\u2019t tell them and decide that if they cared about you enough/in the right way, they\u2019d get it right \n\nYou told your brother you\u2019d gotten a job, and you got what sounds like a positive response from him. But because it was the wrong positive response, you found it really upsetting, because you took it to mean that he didn\u2019t care. (Incidentally, it would literally never occur to me to respond to that news with \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d)\n\nI have this theory that depression is like a behavior-altering parasite. There\u2019s a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii that can only reproduce inside a cat. If a mouse gets it, the parasite makes the mouse attracted to the smell of cats, the mouse gets eaten, and the parasite is back where it wants to be.\n\nDepression is kind of like that \u2014 it makes your brain lie to you in ways that make it even harder to get better. It tells you that your brother\u2019s behavior is deliberate because he doesn\u2019t like you. \n\nThat lie is making you withdraw from him to the point of refusing to go to his wedding, which will drive a HUGE wedge between you and him, as well as between you and the rest of your family. Being isolated like that, with a lot of the people you love angry at you, is likely to make the depression worse.\n\nHave you ever looked into cognitive behavioral therapy? It\u2019s not a panacea, but it\u2019s really useful for learning how to recognize harmful thought patterns and assumptions. \n\nI\u2019m withholding judgment, because right now you\u2019re not TA, just confused and hurting. You would be TA if you skipped his wedding, though.",
