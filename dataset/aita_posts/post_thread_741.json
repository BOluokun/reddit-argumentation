  "post content": "This happened yesterday.\n\nMy husband and I went to the gym, worked out and then opted to take a sauna together. The sauna is about 8 ft x 10 ft and was already occupied by two other couples. They were engaged in a very loud conversation when we entered, so we just laid down our towels, sat down and minded our own business. \n\nProblem is, the conversation just kept going and one woman in particular was so loud. Any time there would be a lull in the conversation, I would hope it would end, but the one especially loud woman would start it back up again, starting every sentence with an extra loud \u201cSO!\u201d It wasn\u2019t just the volume that was obnoxious, but the content of their conversation was a lot about how old they are and being old sucks (I know they were 22-27 in age because they said it multiple times, my husband and I are 50, for reference.) and how much they can\u2019t wait to move out of our city. \n\nI kept my eyes closed trying to ignore them, but at one point I leaned over, whispered in my husband\u2019s ear that I wish they would shut the fuck up. I\u2019ve never had an interaction with a stranger where I asked them to be quiet that has gone well, so I kept on ignoring them. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, my husband decided to take matters into his own hands and stare at them with a shocked/disgusted face. I opened my eyes when I heard the loud one say, \u201cyou could just ask us to be quiet instead of being passive aggressive about it!\u201d It devolved pretty quickly after that. I know she said she could be as loud as she wanted because it\u2019s always like that in the sauna (not true.) She also made the \u201cwe were here first!\u201d argument. Finally, the loud one\u2019s girlfriend got up, stormed out, slammed the door so hard it bounced back open, and started yelling, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask about the RULES!\u201d I imagine she found out that the rules are to keep your voice down and be respectful of others because she didn\u2019t come back and the manager was really nice to us as we left. \n\nSO! Are we the assholes for wanting the sauna to be quiet-ish and my husband staring at the loud people and me jumping into the fight or are they the assholes for not following the rules and not reading the room?",

Doesn't matter who was there first. And you can't control other people, so if you're so bothered by their loudness, either politely ask them to quiet down, or leave.",
