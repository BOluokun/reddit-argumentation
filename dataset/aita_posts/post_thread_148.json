  "post content": "I(28F) used to have a great relationship with my MIL(58F) until my children started growing up. I have three boys, 4y, and 6y twins.\n\nMy MIL wants the boys over the weekend to spend time with them and I am grateful she takes them so I can clean, relax and go out with my husband.\n\nI am very peculiar about the children eating fast food like McDonalds and KFC. KFC, they\u2019ve had along with Subway and some other fast food places but I avoid ordering from those places. When they get older, sure, I will be unable to stop them from eating fast food but when they are this young and eat what I give them I rather they don\u2019t know McDonalds even exists.\n\nMy MIL rolled her eyes the first time I mentioned this and asked her to not order it. She told me she thought I was being ridiculous because my husband ate McDonalds every day after school and he turned out fine (insert him having the most delicate stomach I\u2019ve seen on a human being).\n\nI told her she can think it\u2019s silly, just to please not order it for the boys. She agreed. A few weekends ago surprise surprise the twins came back talking about \u2018their secret meal from mummy\u2019 giggling around. I took them to the mall and they were frantically pointing at the big M begging me to go.\n\nI asked them how they knew it was so good and they said because they ate it but I can\u2019t know (FBI will draft them for their lying abilities for sure). I called my MIL told her I did not appreciate it and she should at least tell me next time. She said okay, it was a one time deal.\n\nNext weekend, same thing, except the kids ate a ton of snacks, drank only sugar drinks and stayed up till 12a.m. That includes the 4yo. I tried to talk to my MIL again and told her we can make compromises but she needs to be willing to work with me.\n\nAgain, okay sure. Kids come back the third weekend giggling again and tell their dad they ate McDonalds 3 times over at grandma. \n\nI got pissed off at this point and next weekend just kept the kids. My MIL came over and asked me if something was wrong. I told her I was disappointed she was completely ignoring me. She said it was her house her rules, I was controlling and needed to get myself a hobby. She also called me an a-hole when I said from now on she is welcome to visit them at our house but they won\u2019t be going over to her house.\n\nMy husband backed me up which is nice but AITA? My mom said I overreacted.\n\nThank you all for validating my emotions. I was beginning to think I was being petty and going crazy. I do know the lying is a bigger issue and that was discussed the first time and was cleared so far. Kids came back and we asked them what they ate and they told us everything. \n\nFor everyone saying stfu if you want a babysitter for the weekend, well, I can watch my kids and I can call a babysitter. I won\u2019t screw with what I stand for because I want someone to take my kids for a day or two.\n\nTo those that went crazy that I am creating picky eaters and withholding certain foods, I can only laugh. They\u2019ve become picky after eating so much junk and now refuse healthy foods and keep begging to get the same \u2018cool\u2019 nights they have at grandma. So yeah, she made fast food to be this unicorn food and I have to spend 20-30 minutes trying to explain why we cannot have cheeseburgers for dinner and candy and stay up late.\n\nThey have fast food at birthdays- KFC, Chick-fil-a.. whatever the host serves they can have. This is about food habits and preferences. Please stop assuming everything is black and white. They are not prohibited from having certain foods, but they are fed healthier options.\n\nHow am I the villain for saying \u2018Hey, since they spend so much time with you, how about working on a compromise on the food they get?\u2019 Did I say completely no to junk food? No. I said I wanna work something out. I am willing to let her incorporate it in their schedule, just not two days out of the week. There is a golden middle people.",

If my child ever told me that someone told them to lie to me or hide things from me we would have problems. You gave her so many chances. \n\nDo I think you may be a little strict about food & that someday your children will grow up to want nothing but junk food? Of course I do. But I still wouldn\u2019t let someone like that around my children alone either.\n\nEdit to say- OP I think you\u2019re a great parent. When I said you may be a little strict I really did mean a little & with your edit I don\u2019t even think that anymore. Your comment about grandma making these foods unicorn foods that they now think are amazing fun things they can have when someone breaks moms rules was definitely a big part of what I was thinking. \n\nI also have to deal with a mother in law that loved to try and prove that she\u2019s the best mom ever by not following my rules with my kids, I responded with a year of no unsupervised time with them & it helped so much & also has shown her son that it\u2019s okay to stand up to his mom. She still tries to argue sometimes but in the end she doesn\u2019t undermine us. I doubt it will last long but if she goes back to it she will get another time out. Stand your ground with your boundaries, it may take a while for her to get it but if you don\u2019t she\u2019ll never respect you as a parent. And ignore the people that say you should just deal with it because she\u2019s willing to babysit, that\u2019s ridiculous.",

Like, how on earth is feeding kids a variety of home-cooked food going to make them picky??? \n\nEvery extremely picky I've met, they're picky because they're so used to homogenous fast-food style foods that they can't stomach other flavours.",

It's something they tell themselves when they give themselves or their children unhealthy food, so they don't have to feel bad about themselves. That and/or they have no nutritional knowledge. \n\nJunk food is addicting. It's loaded with salt, fat and carbs(sugar).  \nThe stuff our bodies are wired to crave because of our evolution.(calorie dense food = survival for our ancestors).\nNobody is addicted to broccoli the same way. \nFast food companies know this and are using it to make profit.\n\nIt's very hard to switch to or even occasionally have  healthy food after years or lifetime of junk food. Your pallate is used to tasting a truck load of salt, sugar and fat. So if you eat a healthy food, it will taste\n bland. That's how you get picky eaters. You would have to consistently eat healthy foods for weeks low in sugar fat and salt for your pallate to reset and for you to actually start tasting the food.\n\nYour gut microbiome is also  loaded with bacteria that thrive on junk food. You likely have an overgrowth of bad bacteria at this point if you've eaten junk for years. \n So if you switch to healthy food get ready for alot of digestive issues, and withdrawal symptoms. \n\nNot to mention the absolute lack of any sort of nutrition.  Feeding growing children empty calories will negatively impact their development and health in the long term.",
