  "post content": "My husband and I just got into (another) fight because his best friend who comes over every Wednesday is (again) staying the night. \n\nMy husband and this friend have had a Wednesday night \u201cdate\u201d where the guy comes over to our house to \u201cjam\u201d every week for the last two years, and I\u2019m getting to the point that I want to hit the guy over the head with whatever is closest at hand every time he is around. \n\nBuckle up. This is probably going to be a long one.... if you make it through all of this you are my hero. \n\nAt first he was supposed to come over just for a few hours on Wednesday nights to play guitar with my husband while I was at work. Over time I have stopped working late Wednesday\u2019s but the jam session continues. Which was fine. However, for the last year they have barely touched the guitars and instead the guy just comes over to get high (on pot). Neither my husband or I get high with him (I don\u2019t enjoy pot and my husband isn\u2019t much into it either, but we aren\u2019t morally against it so we didn\u2019t say anything early on when we should have). \n\nNow that he is always high here, he NEVER leaves at the end of the night. Just expects to sleep over. But he doesn\u2019t have a regular sleep schedule so instead of sleeping while we are, he is wandering around our house all night (in his boxers) making noises, watching tv, getting nonstop text alerts from other friends and ect. This always wakes me up and I have to pass by him on the way to the bathroom. At these points he always has demands. Like: \u201cI want to watch this random movie your husband said you had. Find it for me.\u201d Or \u201cyou need to change your litter box right now, because your cat just pooped and I can\u2019t stand the smell.\u201d He always says he\u2019ll leave when my husband goes for work at 8am, but then complains that he couldn\u2019t sleep until 6am, so he ends up sleeping until mid day. At which point he just decides to stay until my husband gets home from work and then the whole thing starts over again. What\u2019s supposed to be one night a week often turns into at least two every week. \n\nOn top of never leaving, he has started showing up HOURS before my husband gets off work on Wednesday\u2019s. My husband has told him \u201cmy home is your home\u201d so he just comes right in. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if he could self entertain. But no. He comes in and will just walk into our bedroom (where I\u2019m hiding) sit down on the bed, take a hit of his shit, and start talking to me through whatever I\u2019m doing/watching on tv. \n\nEvery time he is here he eats A LOT of our food (gets the munchies, plus regular meals) but never once has had the courtesy to bring anything of his own, or to share, or to replace what he is eating here. He just goes into our fridge and pantry and eats whatever he wants because my husband told him our home was his. \n\nMy husband is always begging me to be nice and not say anything while he is here because he is lonely and needs friends.... except he has his other best friend living with him, and is constantly going on weekend trips all over the country to visit his other friends.  Not to mention those nonstop text message alerts all night. \n\nDealing with this guy is like hanging out with a 17 year old stoner non stop. He farts and burps as loud as possible wherever. Whenever. Is demanding and needy, but completely rude at the same time. Saying things like \u201cdude! You actually made your house look SORTA nice this week.\u201d (As I was prepping for Christmas), and \u201cso you do sometimes make an effort on your looks\u201d (when I had gone somewhere nice and come home with makeup on). He also complains non stop about the food I make (yet eats it all anyway). \n\nThis year for my birthday we couldn\u2019t afford to get any gifts, so I asked my husband instead to line up his days off so we could spend four days just us together...... then this guy broke up with his girlfriend and my husband begged me to let him come over just for a bit on the first evening. Que TWO full weeks of him not going home, and demanding all of my husband\u2019s time. I spent \u201cour time\u201d and my birthday, holed up in our room alone. \n\nThen, Christmas comes. I had invited my whole family to our house and tried to make things extra special because it was the first time I got to see my parents on Christmas in more than ten years. This guy\u2019s mom had just moved to another state BUT this guy has plenty of money and no job to work around so he could have easily made the trip to her for Christmas. But he didn\u2019t. Then his other friend/housemate also went out of town and he threw a \u201cwoe is me, I\u2019m all alone one Christmas Eve, no one loves me\u201d tantrum until my husband invited him to our house. He shows up. Gets high. And is a complete ass to everyone. Then throws a fit when he decides to sleep over because he has to sleep on the couch in a sleeping bag (my family were in the other beds.) the next morning we sit down to breakfast and he lets out this HUGE stinky fart right at the table like it\u2019s nothing, then proceeds to dish himself up 90% of the food and just generally be a douche. My family was flat out disgusted by him and his behavior and couldn\u2019t wait to leave. He stayed for three days. \n\nI feel like an ass hole because he is my husband\u2019s best friend and I don\u2019t want to make them not hang out, and honestly he hasn\u2019t done anything truly terrible. He\u2019s just annoying as shit. I fucking dread every Wednesday, and then I\u2019m super irritated the whole time he\u2019s here. Which I hide from him, at my husband\u2019s request, but then my husband and I always end up fighting over him not leaving at the end of the night. \n\nI\u2019m honestly one or two Wednesday\u2019s away from homicide with this guy, and all this I\u2019ve told you is just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, please tell me AITA for being upset at my husband for letting this guy stay over again tonight, and wanting a substantial break from his best friend? \n\n\n\nTL;DR My husband\u2019s best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. AITA for not wanting him to come over for a LONG time? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you all for your overwhelming response!! I haven\u2019t been able to reply to all of you, but I want you to know I\u2019ve read every post and I appreciate all of your opinions (even the ones calling me a shrew) and your great advice! \n\nSome clarification and an update: In case you weren't already sick of reading all this >< \n\n\nClarification 1: As some have pointed out, there isn\u2019t much of an action here for me to ask AITA about. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make it clearer originally. The question is am I unreasonable and being an Ass Hole for wanting a break from having this friend over. My husband and I fought over this last night and he feels I\u2019m being overly upset and needlessly irritable at said friend. You\u2019ve already read how I feel about it. \n\n\nClarification 2: This post, admittedly doesn't give much positive about the friend. His friend has been in my husband\u2019s life since he was in grade school, and while the friend is over they do actively chat, watch movies, and generally hang out while I actively hide and feel irritated. All this stuff for sure could look like an exaggeration if it all happened in the last few days, but this is sorta my laundry list of the last two years of grievances which have been building up over time. On a regular Wednesday he is just stoned, flatulent, and childish, which while annoying, isn\u2019t really actively douchy. He has done some very nice things for my husband, such as paying to take him to some very expensive concerts so that they could both nerd out over their favorite guitar players Live. I -clearly- don\u2019t like the guy, but my husband gets a lot of enjoyment out of their friendship and I\u2019m not saying that has to stop. Just that -I- need a break. Also, my husband DOES have other friends, they just have lives so he only gets to hang out once every few months with them. He is also in a band with other friends whom he sees regularly every Monday night. \n\nClarification 3: My husband doesn\u2019t see a problem with how he speaks to me because according to him \u201cthe guy just has poor social skills, that comment about your makeup was a compliment.\u201d\n\nClarification 4: He smokes a vape style pot pen, not a physical bud, which has less residual scent and is why my husband told him he could do it in the house. Before he started using I was ok with him. He still had poor manners, but he wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as he is now, and he never spent the night (or longer). Back before the pot I even enjoyed hanging out with the two of them every so often. Oh and I KNOW my husband occasionally also imbibes with him, which isn\u2019t something that makes me mad. He doesn\u2019t go overboard like his friend. \n\nUPDATE: When I woke up this morning I noticed that my phone was buzzing\u2026. And buzzing\u2026. And buzzing\u2026. As all these awesome comments kept pouring in. I have never really had much success on Reddit, so when I looked and saw how many comments there were I said \u201cOh My GoD!\u201d Of course my husband asked what was wrong and I said \u201cI told the internet the story of ***** and asked if I was the ass hole for what we fought over last night.\u201d He said..\u201dOh\u201d and that was it. BUT then on his way out of the bedroom he said \u201cI\u2019m going to get him up\u201d, and by the time I was dressed and out of the room they guy was out of the house and driving away. Hallelujah!!! \n\nForty minutes later when he got to work I received a text message telling me how I was his best friend and that he loves me more than the world ect. Then we texted back and forth and he said \u201cI really feel like we both contribute to it. I feel like you are overly grumpy on things pertaining to *****. But at the same time, I invite him to come up extra days, or stay the night without running it by you. I feel we could both do better and relieve a lot of stress and frustration. Do you agree?\u201d  \n\nHe then called a few minutes later and I told him that I know I\u2019m grumpy but I feel like it\u2019s reasonably so. I also told him I didn\u2019t want to force them not to be friends just that -I- needed a break from the friend. Then I gave him some possible solutions such as hanging out at his house every other week, or have a set time that the guy needs to stop smoking in order to drive home later (thanks guys! Great suggestions!) and he agreed to consider other arrangements with the hang out time so that I could have some time away from the friend, and we agreed to talk more about it when he is off work tonight. Although I can tell he STILL isn\u2019t seeing a problem other than my attitude : / \n\nAgain thank you to everyone who has commented! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR My husband\u2019s best friend is a rude stoner who never leaves. AITA for not wanting him to come over for a LONG time? \n",

He lives off a malpractice lawsuit from when he was born. Basically the doctor used forceps wrong and caused him to have a lifelong problem with seizures. Most of the guy\u2019s friends like him, but can\u2019t handle it when he has one. He likes coming here because I have been trained to take care of people during that and have experience as a live in caregiver to a lady who also seizures. When it happens here, I care for him and make him feel like it\u2019s no big deal (instead of freaking the fuck out like his other friends) because it isn\u2019t a big deal. That\u2019s honestly the one thing I DON\u2019T resent doing for the guy (why it wasn\u2019t in the main story). He smokes pot a lot because he says it helps with the seizures. Which is fine. But he was only getting four seizures a year before he started smoking and is down to three, so I think he is taking that excuse a bit too far. He just really likes being high.  ",

One of my friends started having seizures when she was in her early 20s. Every time it happened she had to go to the hospital, and she was not allowed to drive for 6 months. 3x a year (if he has similar restrictions) means he's basically stuck doing Uber or public transit, assuming you live in a place that's good at that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, not excusing, but I get why your husband feels sorry for the guy. I had a similar friend (somewhat less rude and minus seizures) and it took me years to stop making excuses and drop him. Things always start off fine, then bit by bit they boil the frog and become more entitled, more weird to your friends and significant others, etc. We would go out and then at the end he'd go \"oh I don't have my wallet can you spot me.\" And I'd agree. This would happen just about 80% of the times we ever went out for lunch, or dinner, or drinks, or coffee. I bankrolled his nights out for years. He'd come with my so I could get some biking gear, and then pick out the same thing, wait til we got to the counter and it was rung up, and then say \"oh man I don't have cash, can you cover me.\" And I would. Like a dunce. He once came into my bedroom where my GF was (pretending to be) asleep and just say on the edge of the bed, silently, waiting for me. Which creeped her the fuck out. And on and on, for years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually I realized that I couldn't \"fix\" him. I'd done all I could and it made no difference, and he was a grown-ass man to boot. Yes, he had redeeming qualities, we had fun together, but all the other shit just became a burden. I decided it just wasn't my responsibility anymore. It was only an impediment to *my* life and my relationships and I was tired of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour husband will probably get to the same point eventually, but it sounds like he's just plugging his ears and pretending everything is cool for now, like I did. If he legitimately wants to spend the rest of his life as this guy's caretaker, then that's a conversation y'all should have because that's exactly what will happen if he doesn't make an active decision to cut it off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe also doesn't seem fully aware that in relationships, it's not always about what some friend or whoever *does.* It's about how your SO responds to it. It feels super shitty to have an SO fail to stick up for you. Maybe he doesn't get that yet, or is just blind to it in this case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

In fairness to OP the husband clearly suffers from self confidence issues to have a friend like this, which leads me to believe she is probably not used to standing up for herself either. This is probably why she posted here.",

Stop cooking for the household the days he's there, stop preparing food for him to be there, tell your husband he's in charge of laundering the linen and bedding of his friend, cleaning up the living room, bathrooms, kitchen after him. Let your husband know this friend makes you feel unwelcome and anxious in your own home and this makes you feel unloved by your husband and will not only impact sexy time with you but us undermining your marriage in general. I'm not saying not to sleep with your husband, but until your husband is inconvenienced as much as you are, he won't do anything about the situation. Ask him who he'd rather be living with long term, you or his friend. ",
