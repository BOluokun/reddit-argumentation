  "post content": "Okay I don\u2019t even know where to start with this whole thing. I\u2019m using fake names even though I don\u2019t think my family use reddit. Sorry for formatting, I\u2019m doing this on my phone. So I, 18F, live with my mum and my mum\u2019s partner (Edna). My brother (Winston, 24) used to live with us but moved out when he had a baby with his girlfriend. I moved into the bigger room when he moved out. He knew when he moved out that if he moved back, he\u2019d have the smaller room. Winston now wants to leave his girlfriend and move back in, but the baby\u2019s cot is too big for the small room. \n\nTonight I was sat downstairs with my mum, Edna, Winston, my twin (Emma) and Winston\u2019s girlfriend. He asked if I would consider moving back to the small room so he could fit the cot into the bigger room. He said he\u2019d pay more board to our mum and reimburse me for any of the things I couldn\u2019t fit in the small room. Now the only reason this may be a problem is since moving in May, I\u2019ve bought so much more stuff. My mum offered to pay for shelving but it would honestly be such a struggle to fit everything I have in that room. It would be a double bed, shelves, desk and chair. \n\nWhen I say this room is small, I mean it. There is a double bed, small drawers and a desk and it\u2019s such a tight fit as is. My room is what I view as my sanctuary. I sleep there, I spend a lot of time there because it\u2019s the only space away from my family and the invasive dogs. Emma said that if I refuse the deal, I\u2019d be directly impacting the life of my nephew and Winston. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the a-hole. I don\u2019t think that I should have to move out of my room. I genuinely have so much stuff in here now and I think I would have to sell so much of my stuff just to fit in that room. I want to cry. It\u2019s a lose-lose situation and I\u2019ll feel crap with either decision. WIBTA if I didn\u2019t want to move to the smaller bedroom?",

If it were just small but the baby still fit, that'd be different as well. However, if a safe sleeping spot for the baby can't fit in that room, they're still going to need to put the baby somewhere.  The situation isn't going to just vanish.  If there's any rooms that can convert, anywhere to dig up extra storage, etc look for those alternatives now.  If you parent is taking him and his baby into the house, it is going to be crowded - find a better solution or they will find whatever they can, and you'll lose any chance to improve the situation.\n\nSo far, NAH... but plenty of potential for it to get worse from here.",
