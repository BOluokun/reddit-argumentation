  "post content": "Alright so this one messes with me a bit because it happened with a fairly close friend of mine and my wife says I'm an asshole for this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nContext: I'm a 38 year old and I work in the banking industry and I'm a Partner at a fairly prestigious firm in my country and I earn well over a million on most years (this is important later down).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently I got a yacht and invited some of my friends and their SO's over to stay the weekend and have a nice weekend boat trip.  All was fine until Saturday evening after dinner, we sat around the table and were talking about life and our careers especially how far we've come since college.  Jordan (one of my friends) decided to bring up careers, which is something I don't like discussing about myself because it often incites jealousy and arguments but anyways.  We effectively did like a \"go 'round the circle\" thing, and when it was about to be my turn I excused myself to \"go to the toilet\" but everyone else caught on and they said something along the lines of \"we know what you're trying to pull, just tell us\".  I said that I work in the financial industry and I make 100k (we were also discussing salary for some reason).  From the look my wife gave me, Jordan caught on and said \"Stop bullshitting and tell us what you actually make\".  I said \"Ok fine, I lied, 100k is my bonus, I make 500k\" which isn't true either.  At this point it was easy to tell that I was lying because I was going slightly red and my palms were sweating a lot.  Jordan once again caught on and said very loudly \"Just goddamn tell us what you make, and I'll leave you alone\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I finally told the truth.  \"I make 3 million in a bad year, and 8 million on a good year, ya happy now\".  Jordan's face essentially contorted into a vicious sneer and proceeded to start calling me a \"Corporate sleezbag\" and that I \"leech of people's hard work and defraud the government\" etc, none of which I do,  as I literally sacrified my social life and health at one point to get where I am now.  He continued unleashing his vitriol at me for 15 minutes, and I was calm until he started attacking me personally, saying that I was a shitty greedy person and that I should go drown myself because I embezzled from hardworking people like him, which again neither of which I do because I don't even work in consumer banking I work in corporate finance.  I finally snapped (something which I do very rarely because I get really terrifying) and screamed at him to get his ass out of my boat, and called him every swear word under the sun, including \"pansy ass cunt\" among other things and didn't stop for a solid 10 minutes. I effectively just dragged him out of my boat and told his girlfriend to \"fuck off and find a new dick to suck, because his won't stand anymore\".  After which I just sat in the cabin and stared out the window.  Now here I am at home and my wife won't speak to me because she calls me an asshole for doing all that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?\n\n^((I'll edit the post as necessary))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT1: Just to let you guys know, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.  \n\n\nEDIT2: Ok, so I've realised that I'm an absolute asshole for screaming at Jordan's girlfriend and I'll apologise to her as soon as I can get in contact.  And I'm going to have to talk with my wife about what happened and to see if we as a couple can move past this.  I also need to apologise to my other friends for them getting caught in the middle of my screaming, and I need to cut all ties with Jordan.  - I'm an idiot for loosing my shit.",

              "content": "I can see how from your perspective the fact that your wife didn't defend you must have made you feel very abandoned. You needed her support but she didn't provide it and so you had deal with the situation on your own, and that sucks. \n\nBut, if your account of how things happened is accurate then I don't think your wife getting involved would have necessarily helped. When more people join an argument then it tends to lead to more escalation and anger and things may have got even more out of hand than they already did. And so your need to feel defended and supported would directly contradict a broader goal of not wanting the situation to get too out of control - if your wife had got involved and it turned into a slappy catfight between her and Jordan's girlfriend or something, would that really have been a better outcome? \n\nThe key thing is that Jordan is the asshole here. His behaviour was the problem. You and your wife both responded differently to an emotionally overwhelming situation and both of you could have perhaps made better/different choices, but feeling angry/resentful towards each other is pointless when neither of you were the source of the problem. If you try and have a calm chat with each other at some point about what to do if a similar situation arises again, what you both need/want/expect from each other when things like that happen, and what you don't want to repeat from this time then that'll serve you well going forward. But the important thing is to keep blame out of that conversation, because the only person to blame is that asshole Jordan.",
