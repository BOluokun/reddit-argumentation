  "post content": "As a special favor, I babysat my coworker\u2019s 8 year old son the other evening. The kid asked for pasta and red sauce for dinner, so I made a really great tomato/red wine/sausage sauce recipe I know. He absolutely loved it.\n\nA couple days later, my coworker told me that her son hasn\u2019t stopped raving about the pasta dish I served him, and asked for the recipe, which I gladly gave her. Upon reading it, she got really angry, and said that it was totally inappropriate for me to serve a child wine sauce. I told her that the alcohol almost entirely boils off when the sauce simmers, but she said that she does not want her kid consuming any amount of alcohol, and that I was really irresponsible for not asking her permission first. Before babysitting, I asked if her son had any food allergies/dietary restrictions, and she said no. When I mentioned this to her after she got upset at me, she said that it\u2019s common sense to not feed someone else\u2019s kid something with alcohol in it without asking permission.\n\nWhen I was little (I\u2019m in my early 30s, so I\u2019m not that old), all of us kids grew up eating red wine tomato sauce, penne alla vodka, meats with wine sauce, tiramisu, fruitcake, etc., and nobody would have ever thought to ask parents\u2019 permission before serving such dishes to someone else\u2019s kid. I don\u2019t think this is a generational thing, none of my friends with kids would have a problem with it either. Is my coworker being weird, or was I the a-hole?\n\n(BTW, the coworker isn\u2019t of a religion that prohibits alcohol \u2014 I have had drinks with her on several occasions.)",

Also worth bearing in mind how much alcohol we are talking about here in the first place.  I'm guessing for a small batch, you're talking about 1/2 cup of wine or in that neighborhood,  and let's say that's \\~12% alcohol by volume, mixed into a whole pot of sauce.  Now I was told there would be no math here, but 5% of that initially small amount spread through that whole sauce is such a small amount that it's kooky to even consider IMO.

Buy some vanilla beans and some glass jars with good stoppers.  Fill them most of the way with vodka (or bourbon, I'm trying that as well, and I think rum will work too).  Split some vanilla beans and put them in.  And then wait (and gently shake them now and again).  Did my first batch in November.  Best to wait 6 - 12 mos, but I've read you can use as soon as 2 - 3 mos.  I made several bottles, because the real beauty is that as you use the bottles, you can just add more vodka and over time more beans and let it sit again.  So I have a rotation now.

So that is like drinking the spendiest cognac cost wise which kind of makes me laugh at how kids will adapt anything to get drunk.\n\nWhat we used to do was pour small amounts of spirits off the bottles at home (like a shot glass worth) so it wasn\u2019t missed and then mix it with codeine based cough syrup which was very cheap and easily available. So a bunch of 14 year old Northern Irish kids mixing booze and opiates at a bus stop in the 90s and running from the police or army foot patrols was our high for a while.\n\nI graduated up to supermarket own brand white vermouth which at the time was about \u00a32.69 for a litre. Fortified wine is about 14%. Chuck in some lemonade and you felt fancypants compared to necking cough syrup and vodka.\n\nVery tortured relationship with booze across Ireland but in hindsight I was also an addict when I was younger. So vanilla extract is either self regulating by cost or already into desperate territory.\n\nNow I keep vermouth in the house for cooking. It lasts much better than white wine so if you want wine for cooking but not always drink it, it\u2019s a brilliant inexpensive way to do that if you keep it in the fridge. I do often look at the bottle and think \u2018fuck, I am glad my boozehound days are behind me....\u2019",

I chop it up finely whereas the recipe leaves the sprig whole and removes it at the end).\n\nAdd a can of tomatos, refill the can halfway with red wine (or more to taste) to rinse out the tomato scraps and add to sausage and onions.\n\nLet simmer for as long as you want. Grate some Parmesan. If you have an old Parmesan rind that can go in the sauce for flavour. \n\nBoil your pasta. When it\u2019s 3 minutes from al dente, add your grated Parmesan (generous handful) and a good glug of double cream. Lower the heat. \nDrain the pasta and add to sauce and stir vigorously. \n\nEat with the rest of the red wine and some garlic bread if you fancy. \n\nCan\u2019t recommend this dish highly enough.",

          "content": "I\u2019m pretty proud of my beef red sauce/bolognese, so I\u2019ll shamelessly give it here even though I\u2019m not OP. The instructions look really long but are fairly simple, I just hate recipes that don\u2019t give enough detail. Serves 4-6.\n\nGrate a couple of carrots and finely dice an onion, cook on low for about 10 mins in a broad based pan in around a tablespoon of olive oil. Include finely sliced celery if you don\u2019t hate the stuff.\n \nAdd 400g beef mince, minimum 10% fat ideally, and turn the heat to medium. Press the mince down to brown and then turn it over and do the same on the other side. (You can use low fat beef or turkey mince, but the sauce won\u2019t be as smooth.)\n\nAdd dried herbs and/or garlic. I use marjoram and basil.\n\nAdd about 200ml red wine and stir it well into the mince, breaking it up. You want something acidic to help tenderise the meat at this stage, so it goes in now, not later. Some people use milk for the same purpose.\n\nAdd 1-2tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e and cook it on low for about 3 minutes, stirring so the mince is completely breaking up. At this point the meat should develop a glossy sheen. \n\nSnip a rasher of bacon into tiny pieces, stir it in and let it cook for a couple of minutes. Smoked bacon is best. If you don\u2019t want to add bacon, add a good shake of salt at this point.\nIf you want to use the sauce as a vegetable-hiding mechanism, add some very finely diced mushrooms too.\n\nAdd a 400g tin of plum tomatoes or passata (chopped tomatoes aren\u2019t as nice in my experience, and the tinned plum toms break up easily with cooking and a bit of stirring).\n\nFill the tin about two thirds with water and pour the liquid into the pan, swilling it around to get all the tomato bits out. If using a slow cooker, only fill the tin one-third.\n\nGive it a good stir for about 3 minutes on high heat, so that it\u2019s bubbling (this is a hygiene thing more than anything). Break up those tomatoes and any lumps of mince.\n\nCover and cook really low for as long as you can bear to. Some people turn the heat off for a bit, then on, for ultra low cooking. Or slow cooker.\n\nWhen ready to serve, start cooking the pasta and take the cover off the sauce pan. While the pasta is cooking, heat the sauce so it bubbles and steams, to reduce the sauce down to whatever consistency you prefer. Stir it regularly so it doesn\u2019t stick to the pan.\n\nAdd any chopped fresh herbs you want at this point, such as basil or parsley. \n\nTaste the sauce and if it\u2019s lacking a certain something, add a few drops of soy sauce.\n\nOr turn it into a pasta bake. Don\u2019t reduce the sauce, cook penne or similar pasta for three or four minutes less than normal and drain it. Layer sauce, pasta, sauce, pasta in an oven dish, put a load of grated mozzarella on top, and bake it at 200 degrees C for half an hour, until the liquid is bubbling furiously and the top is brown.",

Keep that simmering over a low heat until it reduces in the pan and then top up with two cups water and a stock cube if you prefer more flavour (but in that case watch the salt you add).

My mum uses red wine in her bolognese sauce as well, and when I worked as a dishwasher we actually had these giant box wine caskets that specifically said \"White Cooking Wine\" and \"Red Cooking Wine\" on them, for the purposes of, you guessed it, cooking with.\n\nBut I can kinda get the coworker's side. You have a child in your care and gave them a recipe with alcohol in it, and not tell the parent. Again, I get it, it was for cooking and to give it taste. But a parent, especially one not used to cooking with alcohol, may not see it that way. All they saw was that you gave their young child red wine, and didn't tell them beforehand.\n\nKeep using your red wine in you sauce, but next time you babysit, maybe give a heads up to them that you use red wine for flavour in your sauce and would they be ok with it. Even if it's an overreaction, a parent does have a right to know what their child is being fed especially if it contains alcohol.",
