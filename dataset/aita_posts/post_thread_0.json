  "post content": "I (20) am a mother of triplets whom are only 2 months old. I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind. \n\nI'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online. \n\nSometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.\nMy fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them. \n\nBeing able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down. \n\nMy fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me. \n\nI grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise.\n\nSo here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation.\n\n~~~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~~~\n\nI decided to show my fiance this thread at first he was really upset with me for sharing our personal problems with strangers on the internet even though it's anonymous. \n\nBut in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that. \n\nI just wanna thank everyone for the support that you all give me it brought tears to my eyes (happy tears) seeing how supportive you all were to a stranger on the internet I don't think I ever received this much support before. \n\nI can't believe how much attention this post even got plus the award again thank you so much.",

      "content": "NTA. When I had my baby one of the things the nurses told me repetitively while in hospital and during the home visits is that if she is  crying and I know she has been fed, she has a clean nappy on and she isn't sick and I am getting stressed out its ok to go outside for a few minutes to just recollect myself. \n\nTheir exact words were \"a crying baby is an alive baby\".\n\nThey tell you this because it is better for a baby to be left to cry for a little while and the parents to get a breather, than for parents to wig out and hurt their babies in frustration.\n\nThis advice was so important. It allowed me to do what I needed to do without feeling guilty. And those few minutes really do help in those times when they won't settle. And I had one, let alone if I had three.\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards and votes. I really hope OP sees she has nothing to feel guilty about and is doing a great job! \u2764",

It took me years of reading subreddits to understand that moms who produce a ton of milk are eating super healthy home cooked meals of 2x the calorie intake and \u2014 shock \u2014 most of the time, their husbands ask if they\u2019ve eaten! Or even might cook! \n\nOP is trapped in a bad spot. The \u201cbad mother\u201d and yelling at her when she\u2019s doing the healthy thing for her children really resonates with me, as someone who divorced a useless piece of shit a few years ago.\n\nMy heart goes out to OP. This will be tough if he has all the support and she doesn\u2019t, as well. She needs a support system close by. Three babies isn\u2019t for the faint of heart.",

Reason being is 1) They don't talk, so you miss out on having adult conversations like at work 2) you can not dictate/schedule your break time 3) They cry and crying is an evolutionary trait designed to make mothers guilty / put in 110%. 4) The days are the same, with little variety 5) All of this together, is a mental toll that can manifest as physical tiredness.... and yes there are jobs out there that can be very challenging so don't take this as a  blanket statement as your situation may be different, I'm just speaking generally.",

You need a partner.  I had one high needs baby, and you do you know how things worked?  While husband was at work, I was the one who looked after kiddo.  He needed sleep to keep his job (he functions less well on lack of sleep than I do, and he was doing a complicated job that he had grown into and didn't have formal training in) so when he came home, I handed kiddo off to him and slept. He was the main parent on deck.  When she was nursing every 1 to 2 hours at night, I took over when he went to bed.  When she slept more, when I woke up we were both the parent on deck, and once he went to bed, I was the main parent again.  \n\nBecause sleep deprivation is torture - literally it's against the Geneva convention to subject prisoners to it, but we expect first time moms to be able to raise tiny humans while sleep deprived to an extend that would be illegal if done to a prisoner.  \n\nWe celebrated the day free time was something that could happen during the week and not just during the weekend.",

When I was 15 I had to watch him anywhere from 3-5 hours by myself every day M-F and sometimes he would just NOT STOP CRYING. \n\nSometimes I could not take it, so I\u2019d line the floor around* his crib with pillows and turn on the baby monitor to go play a 10 minute game of halo to chill myself out. Often he\u2019d fall asleep in those 10 minutes or I\u2019d be more relaxed when I\u2019d go back, and I think he could sense I wasn\u2019t so tense and he\u2019d stop crying.\n\nHearing that this is ok makes me feel a lot less guilty about the times I\u2019d leave him alone for those few minutes. \n\nNTA OP, I don\u2019t have kids of my own, but I totally get it.",

His crib was in a corner canopy thing and I\u2019d line the floor with pillows since his crib wasn\u2019t too high, he couldn\u2019t even sit up, I was just paranoid",
