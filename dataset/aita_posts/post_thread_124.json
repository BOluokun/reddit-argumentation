  "post content": "I'm a father with primary custody of a 13 year old daughter. She's had terrible trouble with ear infections and strep. The Dr recommended a tonsillectomy. It is not an emergency,  but will improve her health as she gets older.\n\nMy ex wife and I agreed to let our daughter decide. She is scared, but ultimately decided she wanted it. Called the ENT, and they gave me two dates. The first one was on a day she has an orthopedic appt, and the second 8 days later. We picked the latter. \nAfter I hung up, I remembered it was her mother's birthday. Our daughter said it was fine, they would be with her the day before anyway, and could celebrate then\n\nHer mother had a fit. She said I need to move it, because if something went wrong, it would be a bad memory on her birthday. If I don't move it, she will not pay her share, because she won't agree to it on that day. She said since it's just an elective surgery, she doesn't have to agree anymore if it's on a day she doesn't want.\n\nI'm leaving the date alone, as our daughter wants the extra week to prepare herself for being in pain for 2 weeks.\n\nSo...am I the a-hole?",
