  "post content": "Throwaway because friends on Reddit.  My (27F) husband (35M) have been married for 2 years.  Until the last year, I would have said that things were great. My husband has had an ADHD diagnosis since he was a child and has always done well with medication.  He took meds through school and has managed to hold down a good job with only some mild symptoms.\n\nAbout 6 months after we got married, I noticed that he started to change.  He was a lot more forgetful, irritable, and he started doing a lot of impulsive spending.  I\u2019m a medical resident and knowing he had ADHD, I asked if his meds were giving him trouble. He said that he had stopped taking them.  I tried to reason with him, but he had been reading some blogs and become convinced he didn\u2019t needs meds.  He said that ADHD was his \u201csuperpower\u201d and that I should love him the way he is or not at all.\n\nThings have gotten worse quickly over the last year.  He used to help out with chores and now can\u2019t even load the dishwasher without losing focus and wandering off.  We keep our money separate and even with a good amount of expendable income, he\u2019s gone through a lot of his savings and has trouble paying his section of the bills.  He explodes verbally sometimes and has alienated one of his best college friends over a silly argument in a way that\u2019s not likely to be forgiven.  He won\u2019t acknowledge any of this is happening and gets angry when I point out that I\u2019ve been covering the lion\u2019s share of the expenses for the last four months and trying to take care of the entire house while also doing my residency.\n\nI reached the end of my tether when he asked me for money to cover his car payment for the third time.  I told him that I would keep the utilities on, but his car, insurance, and other expenses were on him and there would be no more handouts.  I also told him that I couldn\u2019t keep burning the candle at both ends, so his laundry and meals were now on him to prepare.  This lasted for less than a week before he started asking for help with his car again.  I told him the only condition on which I would help would be if he started back on some treatment for his ADHD.  Not necessarily the same meds if he didn\u2019t like them, but something, because this was unbearable.\n\nWe had a fight about it and he told me that I should help him because he has ADHD so he can\u2019t help it and needs support. I told him that he had spent the last year telling me that ADHD is his superpower, so he can superpower his way into regular car payments and laundry then without my help or get treatment and receive help. He called me an ableist b!tch and stomped off.\n\nI talked to a psych friend who says that the quip might have been a little unkind but the boundaries are reasonable.  My SIL is angry and says I shouldn\u2019t force him to take meds if he doesn\u2019t want them.  All I know is that it\u2019s exhausting and as much as it hurts the next step is leaving him.\n\nUpdate: I messaged him this morning and asked if we could talk about the state of things this evening over dinner since I\u2019m off call and he said not until I apologize and accept that my attitude is the problem not him.  So, I\u2019ve made arrangements to stay in an AirBnB to clear my head for the next few days so I can at least relax properly between call shifts, and I\u2019ll reevaluate when I\u2019m not feeling so worked up.  This is impacting my work and health too much and reading these replies I\u2019m starting to realize that.  I hope he comes around, but I\u2019ve worked too hard to go down with him.\n\nUpdate #2: We\u2019re separating, I don\u2019t think this is a salvageable situation anymore.  I dropped by the house while I knew he was gone to grab something and it looks like a war zone. There\u2019s a hole in the drywall that looks like he punched the wall. I took pictures and I\u2019m meeting with a lawyer today.  I have housing already lined up.  It\u2019s going to be a fun Christmas this year.",

He needs some kind of treatment as you have said, it doesn't have to be meds, but it has to exist, for him to have a functional life, and for him to be tolerable or enjoyable to interact with. It's his right to not seek treatment or manage his symptoms if that is what he so chooses, and unfortunately, he may stick to his guns on this. But then it is also your right to leave because he is driving you up the wall and has turned into someone completely intolerable to be around. Like, you love him, but you can't stand being around him, which sucks.\n\nEven if he were to turn around at some point in the future, would you want to still be with him, knowing he put you through all this and refused whenever you asked? That you asking wasn't enough of a reason for him to do it even though you said it was unbearable? And there's a possibility this is just the start of the spiral and he's not gonna reconsider for years. I don't think you can wait that long.\n\nYou've tried to set boundaries. You've tried to tell him things aren't working like this. You have tried. You are allowed to say 'I tried to make this work for as long as I could, but it no longer works for me'.",

Encouraging him to take meds and get his shit together is how you support him in a situation like this.
