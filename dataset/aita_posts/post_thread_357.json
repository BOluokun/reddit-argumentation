  "post content": "So freshman year of college, I began working on this project casually. I like to keep notes on women I talk to about their favorite things, activities they enjoy, gifts/candy they like, sappy shit like that. I suck at remembering things like that so I decided to keep a spreadsheet.\n\nEventually after getting a handful of entries. I offhandedly mentioned it to my friend group. One had the idea that I share it with them so we could all keep new entries as they \u201ccaught\u201d different entries. \n\nSo this expanded further. Right now about 40 guys have access to it and it\u2019s mainly the guys in my frat, and the women featured are girls from different sororities. We also added more information such as like where you should take them if you really wanna impress them. We don\u2019t keep this information for any nefarious or scumbaggy reasons. \n\nJust to help us know what to do if we want to impress certain girls. Like the original idea of this was just to keep information like favorite color so I didn\u2019t every forget their favorite colors. Now it\u2019s helping a lot of guys.\n\nSomehow, a girl who was on the list found out and she was pissed tf off. She was eventually able to trace it back to me so I assume someone who was simping for her snitched when the Pok\u00e9dex wasn\u2019t making the girl like him.\n\nSo she\u2019s pissed off and she made it out to be a guide to hooking up with women, when it\u2019s most definitely not that. It\u2019s just to make impressing them on dates easier. That\u2019s it. She\u2019s made a big deal of this telling so many girls around campus and now they\u2019re all saying that by the start of the fall semester, none of them will be visiting our fraternity or going to our parties.\n\nNow all the guys are mad at me, when I\u2019m not even the one who told girls about the list and they were all also using the list. I also think it\u2019s unfair to say the list was all about sex when it wasn\u2019t at all.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit- I\u2019m not a stalker. There was no information in it that could\u2019ve been used to hurt someone. Only to have a better date. And it isn\u2019t about sex. I never used it for just sex.",

I thought OP may just have a hard time remembering details and/or reading someone (like Abed from Community when he tracked his friend's [attitudes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNJN1aV8YWI)). There's nothing inherently wrong with keeping notes about your friend's special dates (birthdays, etc), favorites, dislikes, and other information important to them.\n\nTo share that with his whole frat is what took it too far. At that point it became a \"cheat sheet\" for hooking up with all the sorority girls. I also bet that everyone who had access to the hookup sheet called OP a \"genius\" or a \"legend\", or any other term of endearment, until they got found out.",

They discussed their hookups and debated the validity of relationships!

If you had good intentions to date me and get to know me, the cheat sheet you made would be irrelevant since the fun is in going on dates and finding out who I am first hand. Instead your Pok\u00e9dex (which by the way is kind of an insult unto itself \u201cgotta catch them all\u201d *barf*), is bordering on stalker level creepy and sad-level desperate. \n\nWAIT! But then you shared it with others?! Ok so now you\u2019ve created a legion of creeps who, instead of having the courage to talk to these girls themselves, have a sheet and they can pretend to be into the same things so that maybe they\u2019d have a shot with them?!\u2026 not only are YTA, but in you making this AND sharing it, it\u2019s such a red flag. Compounded by the fact that you see nothing wrong with making it and sharing is a red flag showing your lack of compassion, empathy and self awareness\u2026 because at the end of the day, the vibe doesn\u2019t check out, the Pok\u00e9dex would make any normal, sane woman feel unsafe.\n\nYou\u2019ve systematized the getting-to-know you phase of a potential romance. Quite frankly, in you doing that, you\u2019ve robbed yourself and your bro-gang the chance to develop genuine connection (read chemistry) with someone which is half the fun of getting to know a potential new date. Here\u2019s the kicker, on some level, you KNOW that women love feeling seen and someone getting to know them\u2026 but this is supposed to be a natural process that comes from spending time with someone. So when he\u2019s faking that phase because of joke Pok\u00e9dex and she finds out, the entire experience is marred and ominous because he was being disingenuous about connecting with her. This is the lack of empathy, therefore it is creepy, which leads to feelings of unsafe. Good luck man\u2026. you\u2019ll be wanting to change schools.

Realize that you're young and try to recognize this as an opportunity to learn from your mistakes. Learning to accept that you can be wrong, to admit it, and learning from your mistake, is a skill that will also benefit you greatly later in life.\n\nI'm sorry if I sound patronizing, I don't really mean to be. I don't want to excuse your pokedex, but people make mistakes - our assignment in life is to realize this and reflect over it and learn from it, become a better person. For in becoming a better person, your life will also be much better for you. Good luck, man! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f",
