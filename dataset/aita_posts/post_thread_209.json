  "post content": "My mother-in-law who is experiencing dementia came to live with my husband and I, 5 years ago. We charged her $400 a month. She was bringing in $1,800 a month. Now with the cost of everything going up we have let her and my sister in law (who takes care of her finances) know that we are increasing it to $1000. Her funds have increased to $2,100. This leaves her with plenty of money to pay for anything she wants. We pay for all of her food and staples she uses also added entertainment she may want.  We also take on the added costs of utilities and gas taking her to any appointments she has.  My mother-in-law and sister-in-law (who side note will not let her mother come live with her) are furious saying we are taking advantage of her. Are we the ass holes?",

As a full time caregiver while running my own business and family home, I know you have been giving your MIL a steal. Nursing facilities would cost your mom 8k-10k PER MONTH for a small room. Assisted living not much less. Have your sister-in-law figure out where she will go and let her get a damn good reality check on how much things actually cost when she does not want to step in.  You charging anything shy of 5k is a deal and gift for your MIL.",

My grandma had to move in with my dad (her son) when the town sheriff found her sitting in the middle of her town's lone stoplight intersection. She was lost.\n\nHer house was one block away.\n\nShe'd get combative. There were days that she'd insist she needed to go back to her old house in another state (it was sold as soon as Dad moved her down to help pay for her care. That money did not last long) and she'd get furious and yell and throw things when she was told no. Other days she'd decide she was going to drive to the grocery store. Her car had also been sold, her license had been revoked about the fifth time she wound up in the same ditch, and the grocery store she wanted to go to was in Olkmolgee, Oklahoma. We were in South Texas. And it didn't take long for the ten stories she told everyone, every time she met them, to dwindle to five. And then to three. And then to none. She lost her words. Dad and my stepmom had to hire a full time carer to take care of her when they were at work because she could not be left alone. Someone had to stay in the room with her because we couldn't be sure what she'd decide to do. By the time she was bed-bound, she couldn't talk anymore. All she could do was scream. And she did. Sometimes it sounded almost like words, but mostly it was just inarticulate shouting, like she was in a nightmare she couldn't wake up from...which yeah, she was. I was sad when she finally passed, but it also came with a sense of release. \n\nHaving a loved one with dementia is like watching a beloved photograph fade. First the colors go. Then the grayscale details disappear, until finally there's nothing   \n left but a mostly blank page with maybe just a few traces of that beloved smile left. And you still don't want to let go because, blank or not, it's all you've got left.\n\nNothing about this is going to be easy. It will not let up until the MIL here is either dead, or her condition degrades past what OP and her husband can handle and she *has* to go to a medical facility. You couldn't compensate them for what they're about to go through if you gave them a million dollars a month. An extra six hundred so they don't have to stress so much about paying the bills, it's not even a drop in the bucket.",

She never even got to the paperbacks.)\n\nBut she's begun having episodes where she loses touch with reality. Thanksgiving day, she was convinced that the villains from her latest novel were coming to get her and take her to the same Chinese prison the protagonist was in. It took two days to get her out of it and she didn't remember a damn thing when she was \"back.\" Her docs and my aunt (read as: her carer) are pretty sure UTIs are the culprit, but these episodes are coming faster and lasting longer, and it's getting harder to get Grandma to do the things she needs to do. Like drinking enough water that she doesn't get another UTI. She does have hospice/palliative care involved, because...you know. She's 91. It's going to happen. It's better to get the experts in early before there's no quality of life left to preserve. But that doesn't make this shit any easier to handle.

And the extra money is really a bare minimum to help at least carry the physical costs.\n\nMy gran stayed with us. She had Alzheimer\u2019s. I was 14 when the dementia got bad, and 17 when she died. I was her primary care giver until the last 6 months when my parents got a nurse.\n\nShe screamed. Fought. Cried. Attacked me. Started by calling me my name, then my mom\u2019s name, then her sisters name, then her mom. She had polio as a child, so she couldn\u2019t really walk, so she never ran off anywhere, but the sound of her walker\u2019s click-click coming down the passage will be with me forever. My brother (10 yrs younger) would hide in his cupboard when he heard it.\n\nI carried her to the bathroom for a while, but towards the end I had to change nappies and sponge bath her. That\u2019s why we finally got a nurse. But she was so afraid of her (the nurse) that she would cry for me whenever the woman went near her. So I stayed, but had an extra pair of strong arms.\n\nThe worst was the moments of clarity though. Every now and then the lights would go on and she would know what was happening. But also what she had just done or said. (It happened less and less towards the end thankfully.) And she would look at me and sob. She kept asking for her to die. Begging god to take her. Eventually begging me to end it. All I wanted to do was put a pillow over her head and stop it. I loved her so much. She took care of me as a child. She was my best friend, confidante, cared about my actual interests and feelings. And then she became this.\n\nIt was so strange loving and hating and fearing and pitying someone all at the same time. I know I sound cold, saying I thought of ways to end it. But I love her. So much.\n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t understand, but if I ever get diagnosed I will end it that day.\n\n(Edit a word)\n\n(Edit 2: sorry for the vent but this is just something that weighs so heavily I had to get it out.)",

It's not well known because the diagnosis was posthumous, but at autopsy that found that he had Lewey Body Dementia, and he had it on a scale that it HAD to be affecting his cognitive abilities. Everybody on the set of *Night at the Museum* 2 have said he was visibl*y* underwater during shoots, and struggling to remember lines when his entire career was based on his skill with memorization and improv. His family knew something wrong. He *had* to have known something was wrong. \n\nIt's why I get very angry when people say he \"lost his battle with depression\". No, he fucking didn't. He was very literally losing his mind, and he was losing it to a disease that sounds fucking terrifying--Lewey bodies also cause hallucinations ,and not very nice ones. And even if he had managed to push through things that night and not succeed at suicide...he was still going to die. And it was going to be very slow, very painful, and completely horrifying for everyone involved, including Robin. He didn't lose his battle with depression. He just got into a second fight that he was never going to win, and he chose to end it on his terms. \n\nI think that if the majority of us got a dementia diagnosis while we were still mostly competent, the majority of us would at least consider an easier exit than the long and slow demise. It's not a very laudable thought, but nothing about dying with dementia is good. If you know you're about to be done, the least you should have is a choice in how it goes.",

You have NO obligation to raise MIL's rent by only as much as MIL's income has increased, especially when paying for all her food and staples. You can't control MIL's income or inflation. $1,000 a month in the current environment seems like a reasonable amount for MIL to pay to cover all costs related to food, housing, utilities, transportation and entertainment for a senior, and she still has more than 50% of her disposable income left over. Many people would be relieved to be in that position. You seem fine to me OP.",
