  "post content": "I have chronic migraines and its something I've dealt with my whole life. I've had to constantly work to prevent them. It sucks. I used to think that my girlfriend of 6 months was sympathetic to my issue, but, after this past weekend, I'm not sure. We were just hanging out, and then a headache hit, so, I'm down for the count and my vision is shot for the time being. She gets off the couch and decides to grab a snack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a few minutes of complete silence, almost as if I'm bothering her, she tells me to just \" toughen up and power through it\", so that we could get back to our night. I was pretty pissed off by that comment and told her that I don't need medical advice from someone whose doctor just told her at an appointment that she's obese. \n\nShe thought it was a low blow. I told her I thought her telling me to toughen up was a low blow and added that, maybe instead of snapping at me, she could've helped me get rid of the pain. She's now trying to, amongst her friends, make me out to be a fat shamer. This type of fighting isn't us and I want us to get back to normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

Because the migraines aren't going to disappear, her friends are probably convinced you're a bad guy and now you know that she thinks you need to just suck it up when you don't feel well.",
