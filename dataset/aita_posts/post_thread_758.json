  "post content": "So i live in an apartment building, and we all have balconies.\nThe neighbors from downstairs have this dog, Kaya, who keeps barking in the balcony, right under my living room and bedroom. \n\nI used to communicate with the dude who lived there, but for the last couple of month he wasnt living there, just the lady, and she isnt very nice. Also, talking to the landlord lady didnt help, as she lives right above me and also hates this dog, but the dog owner lady isnt cooperative saying stuff like, \"its a dog! They bark\" \n\nAnyways, for the last month, i've been unemployed due to covid, so i am at home a lot more, and when its not raining, Kaya the dog regularly goes to the balcony and starts barking.\nI've started recording it bark during quiet hours (14:00-16:00 & 23:00+) but today, after she kept barking through these hours, i went to take a nap, and that damn dog woke me (again).\nSeeing as the downstairs neighbors weren't home (again, i tried going down, but there was nobody home, just the 2 dogs barking at the door). I got pissed, filled half a glass of water, and spilled it on that dog (who immediately ran back inside).\n\nAfter about an hour, they came back and they weren't happy, threats and swears were throne, but when that lady tried to complain to the land lady, she took my side.\n\nAfter that, the dog lady came over to lecture me how the water messed her living room (apparently, the wet dog went inside and did a little mess) and after threatening that she would hose our balcony and/or call the cops when we have people over, then telling a sob story of how the dogs are rescues and are like her children, she calmed down, gave me her number so that i could call/msg her when the dog is being annoying.\n\nAITA for throwing water on that dog? I kinda snapped, i dont wanna hurt the dog, its not his fault he wasnt trained and his owner sucks, i figured some water is a humane solution to this problem.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",
