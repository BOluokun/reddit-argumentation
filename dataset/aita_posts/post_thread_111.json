  "post content": "I (19M) visited the zoo today with my family and we were checking out the koalas, who I was especially excited to see. You may not know this, but koalas apparently need over eighteen hours of sleep a day to function or else they can get quite unhealthy quite quickly, and so any exhibit of them at a zoo will often come with an expectation that you maintain a certain level of silence while observing them. This zoo today was no exception - you are made to go through two gates, both of which have signage saying \u2018Please be quiet, keep the noise down, silence please, etc\u2019 and then the door to the koala house itself has another sign: \u2018Please keep noise levels to a minimum\u2019. \n\nWith all those reminders, I figured people would get the memo, but as soon as we entered the enclosure (which was a small room indoors with a glass window looking into the koala pen) I spotted a couple in their early thirties with two young kids and a baby. I somewhat apprehensively tried to observe the koalas (they were so cute and my little sister was happy to see them) but then, like clockwork, the baby starts crying. Hardly the baby\u2019s fault - it\u2019s a baby, they cry - so I gave the dad of the family the benefit of the doubt thinking he\u2019d either take the baby out or calm her down. A few moments pass; the baby gets more annoyed and cries louder. The koalas scurry away, hiding in their cubby holes, and others wake up from their sleeping.\nI give the dad the look. I feel like everyone knows the look - we\u2019ve either had someone give it to us or given it to someone else. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d ever been on this end of it, but I\u2019d definitely received some looks at times.\nBaby continues to cry. I (being a socially awkward autistic teenager) grapple with the idea that the dad might have missed my giving him the look so I do the classic: I shake my head and give a little sigh. No change. I throw another look his way - this time a little more firm - but I feel like I overdo it - my eyes are a little too intense, perhaps - because suddenly the dad is saying, in the voice of someone who\u2019s just gotten a lecture \u2018Well alright mate, it\u2019s just a baby\u2019 to which I reply with a gesture towards the sign \u2018Silence, please\u2019. \n\u2018But it\u2019s a baby!\u2019 he says. \n\u2018Well don\u2019t bring a baby in here\u2019 I reply, in a whisper. My parents jump on me, thinking I\u2019m out of line and the couple and their kids give me the filthiest of looks and leave the enclosure, leaving me feeling very tense.\n\nWhat do we think? I feel like this is a very common struggle in a public place where there aren\u2019t always members of staff to enforce the rules. We want to pick our battles, of course, but this family bringing their baby in spoiled my little sister\u2019s magical moment seeing a koala for the first time. Surely they should\u2019ve seen the signs and thought \u2018Probably best to not bring little Charlie in\u2019 or, if they really wanted to see the koalas, the dad could\u2019ve stayed outside with the baby and the mum and the kids could\u2019ve gone in. AITA?",

I think you did a GREAT job, it was mostly non verbal and dude FINALLY got the hint, but still tried to make excuses \"it's a baby\", well yes, but baby doesn't KNOW when and where is proper to be noisy...cause it's a baby, therefore BE a parent and also be mindful of other creatures, humans or not. So you did have to let him know that the signs are there for a reason, and you even whisper yelled, which showed that even you were trying to keep quiet out of respect. Librarians don't put up with that in their domain, koalas shouldn't have to either, but they can't speak, so they need an advocate, you are a great koala advocate!  \n\nGreat job OP, and you can tell your parents I said so, I'm a mom of two, grandmother of three and my kids would NEVER have kept a crying baby in a quiet place because I taught them manners, and I also took my crying babies out of church, a wedding and a theater -not an infant, a 5 year old who insisted he was old enough to go to the movies even though he was really sensitive to sound-I told him he wouldn't like it and he was feeling really left out because his friends went to the movies, so...yeah, too loud, not a scary movie, but the noise was too much and he got scared so he cried and we left. Because I knew that I was responsible for my little's noise in public.",

In social settings like this, some looks can save them the embarrassment (if they catch on, which this guy clearly didn\u2019t) of them getting verbally called out. Also, it reduces the noise. OP would be a hypocrite to talk to the dad, making more noise himself, while he was mad about the family making too much noise. Sure, maybe you should\u2019ve left it up to the staff. But I agree with you, people shouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to bring a baby that will inevitably cry at some point into a silent place. There was an abundance of signs saying to be quiet. Can they not read? Your assessment of \u201cmaybe shouldn\u2019t bring the baby in\u201d is spot on imo. If a couple brought their baby into a movie theater, a place that has a similar expectation of remaining quiet, and their kid starts screaming\u2026. People would get justifiably pissed! This is arguably worse than that because you\u2019re disturbing animals. \n\nIf the couple really wanted to bring their older children in, they could\u2019ve taken turns. One stays outside with baby, one goes in with the older children, then comes out to watch the baby, other parent goes in. Too inconvenient? Too bad. You chose to have kids and you can\u2019t bring all kids everywhere all the time. You could also have just one parent go in with the older children and leave it at that. It\u2019s not like it was a solo parent who had no choice but to bring all 3 inside. Or, better yet, don\u2019t go see the koalas if you can\u2019t follow the rules. Tons of options that don\u2019t involve making other people and animals inconvenienced by your children. If the baby started crying and they left soon after, that would be fine. If the baby was in a deep sleep, that\u2019s okay as long as they\u2019re quiet. But as soon as the kid starts crying loudly, you need to take them out. He tried to say it was okay just because the baby doesn\u2019t know better. Well, you should!! FFS. From how you\u2019re describing it, it sounds like this kid was crying for awhile too. Not cool.",

Maybe the zoo OP visited had taken this research into consideration when designing the koala enclosure and instructing visitors to keep their noise level low. Maybe this approach will spread to other zoos and koala sanctuaries in future.

Koalas in the wild deal with loud noise all the time. They. Do. Not. Care. \nThey definitely don\u2019t \u201cscurry away\u201d. The koala habitat at my local zoo is very close to the zoo train tracks. They hear a loud ass train all day long. There is no way that a crying baby, separated by glass, is going to bother them. Also, have you heard a koala make sounds? They are loud all by themselves. \nYTA for trying to make yourself sound like a martyr for caring about the health of the koala. If koalas needed quiet to be healthy, the zoo would make sure they had that. But they don\u2019t. Because koalas don\u2019t need quiet. They sleep through anything. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t like the parents with the crying child, remove yourself from the location of the crying child and come back later when it\u2019s quieter. Would it have been respectful for the parents to move the crying child out of the building? Sure. But you could have just as easily removed yourself. Or made this \u201cAITA for saying something to parents with a crying child at the zoo?\u201d The koalas have nothing to do with it. Zoos are public and parents with crying children have just as much right to be there as you do. \nAlso, if you want a quiet experience at the zoo, see if your zoo does quiet hours. Ours does, specifically for people who like a quieter experience. They turn the music off, reduce the lighting in a lot of buildings, and have staff in all buildings to keep the noise level down.",
