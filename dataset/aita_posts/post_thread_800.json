  "post content": "I worked for 5 years at a company in a city's downtown area. This year, the company moved offices to a suburban area about 25 minutes drive outside the city.\n\nA lot of people were not happy with the move, we live in a very walkable city with good public transportation, not a lot of people have cars. \n\nThe company did a few things to ease the transition, that I'll list out here\n\n1. Free bus passes, which were not that practical because the only bus going near the new office leaves only once an hour from downtown. For most people, that would mean taking one bus to get downtown, transferring to another, and then going to work. \n\n2. Organized carpools; if one person in a neighborhood had a car and was willing to drive carpool, the company would connect them with others coming from the same area who needed a ride. The driver would get compensated for their gas, and their time. \n\n3. Discounts arranged with local car dealerships for employees. Hardly anyone used them because even a discounted car is a lot for someone who hadn't been planning on getting a car. Plus, the discounts only applied to brand new cars.\n\nSo anyway, I had a car and wanted the extra money. So for almost a year, I drove a carpool. It was a pain sometimes, organizing with people, getting to the pickup point at 8:10 each morning, waiting on people instead of going straight to work, etc.\n\nDuring this time, I got more and more into cycling. I got a nice bike, used it for almost all my errands and social life in the city, and really enjoyed the workout. \n\nI wanted to start riding into work; it would actually take me about the same amount of time to ride as it takes to do the carpool. 40 minutes. It would be way more fun, keeping moving rather than sitting in traffic.\n\nPlus, my commute was really the only thing I was using my car for, I was biking literally everywhere else and it wasn't making sense to keep the car. The extra money I got for  driving carpool didn't make up for all the costs of registration, insurance, inspections, maintenance, parking permit, gas, cleaning, etc... \n\nSo I told the group last week that I was planning on selling my car and biking into work, starting this Monday.\n\nAnd almost all of them (i drive 5 people) were annoyed at me for bailing on the carpool. They didn't have other good options, none of them had cars. And we all know the bus sucks. Most of them wouldn't be able to bike into work either, out wouldn't want to. It is a strenuous ride and it's cold out this time of year.\n\nI said I'd give them the first dibs on my car when I was selling it, my price was 11,000, and everyone said no, that was too much, my car wasn't worth that, etc. I think it was, I was just following Kelly blue book.\n\nAITA for quitting driving carpool?",

Maybe if you told them that you started biking and that you were thinking about selling your car, that would have given them more time to find a change of ride. \n\nOn the other hand, they shouldn't complain that much, just go back to the company and request a new carpool driver",
