  "post content": "I have a son thats entering 8th grade and a daughter thats entering 9th grade.  Both of them have always been bookworms.  Very studious and cerebral, just like their Dad.  I also played sports all through school and I value the experience that brings.  I've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to.  I tried to insist...maybe they would have fun?  We dont know til we try?  Even just to make them exercise and meet new friends.   My wife insisted I back off.  Fair enough.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow my daughter is entering High School and wants to become a cheerleader.  She has never wanted to do anything even remotely close to cheerleading at any point in her life.  She actively made fun of cheerleaders 3 months ago.  But one of the popular girls moved in down the street last month and she has become a mainstay around my house.  She's convinced my daughter that she has to become a cheerleader in High School because she was \"a loser in middle school and you don't want that to happen in high school.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said no.  I dont appreciate that reasoning.  My wife explained that I dont \"know what its like to be a girl in high school\" and I say OK?  Hows that relevant?  I also dont appreciate cheerleading.  Its too dangerous.  Girls get severely injured doing that, and for what reason?  We don't have the insurance to cover it.  Lastly, I dont like the sexualization of the whole thing.  Those outfits are a bit skimpy, and we're talking about high school girls.  My wife says I'm focusing on the bad and not the good.  Most girls dont get injured.  I'm the pervert because I'm making it sexual.  I pushed for her to join a sport.  I let my son play sports.  She'll have a much better high school experience.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm still like...fuck that shit.  My reasoning is sound.  She's not in it for the right reasons, and the benefits are lame.",

That's an asshole move\n\nEdit: the \"cheerleading is not a sport\" response is tired and adds nothing to the conversation. Cool it with that. We disagree on this point, I get it. Because it isn't legally defined as a sport by courts doesn't mean that it doesn't require athleticism and socialization, both things OP claimed are reasons he was pushing his children to become involved in sports.\n\n[I just want to add this link that contradicts what some people were telling me and thereby part of my previous edit.](https://www.edurisksolutions.org/treating-cheerleading-as-a-sport/) 29 states HSAAs do recognize cheerleading as a sport and treat it as such. So depending upon where you live, it isn't necessarily as dangerous as it was when the 2008 article that was thrown at me twice at least came out.",

Right or wrong, there's a significant portion of the population who consider cheer-leading to be similar in experience or value to child modeling or child pageantry. While I don't agree with that particular sentiment since cheer-leading is obviously a sport given that it isn\u2019t much different from gymnastics or figure skating and that objectification isn\u2019t integral to any sport, but is integral to something like modeling, I can  somewhat understand the hesitance of this possibly prudish person. \n \nThat said, there\u2019s really only two reasons why I\u2019d be against having my daughter be in cheerleading and those are the extreme athleticism and time commitment involved. I played tennis in high school and my level of training for tennis was abysmally low in comparison to what I saw daily for the cheerleaders. They work as hard as or harder than other athletes and that extreme level of strenuous activity might be dangerous for someone who\u2019s still growing. Sure, jumping can lead to the building of strong bones, but my fear is more on the long-term impact on joints.\n\nThis level of training then leads to an incredible amount of time commitment that might take away from study necessary in school to build a solid foundation for a college or academic career. My friend who was a cheerleading fanatic spent 3 hours every day after school to prepare. Tennis, on the other hand, only required maybe an hour and a half a day of practice.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t agree with this guy\u2019s understanding of sexual objectification. Men can sexually objectify everything. I\u2019ve seen some old perverts harass female tennis players before. If this is something that might possibly make her happy and active, that should take precedence over someone else\u2019s warped viewpoint.\n\nTLDR - Let her try it a couple of times, OP.

Cheerleading is, IMO, a sport as well, given what the body goes through (which, before you get into 'too dangerous' is just as bad as a kid playing contact sports.)\n\n> I've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to\n\n.\n\n> I let my son play sports\n\n.\n\n> She's not in it for the right reasons\n\nAnd playing sports because your dad can't get off your back is the 'right' reason?\n\n> We don't have the insurance to cover it\n\nAnd yet you have the insurance to cover your son's injuries while playing \"conventional\" sports?\n\n> Very studious and cerebral, just like their Dad. I also played sports all through school and I value the experience that brings\n\nBasically, you want your kids to be just like you were in school - 'I'm cerebral and studious' 'I played sports' - but when they want to try something different, it's 'the benefits are lame.'\n\n> She'll have a much better high school experience.\n\nNo, she'll resent you. She's, what, 13-15 rn? The closer she gets to 15+, the more she'll rebel (it's human nature) and the more you try and prevent her from doing inoffensive things, the worse it'll be.\n\n> I also dont appreciate cheerleading.\n\nOh boo-hoo. No one's asking you to become a cheerleader. Your kids aren't little mini-mes that can only like the stuff you like/'appreciate'/'respect'\n\n> My wife explained that I dont \"know what its like to be a girl in high school\" and I say OK? Hows that relevant? \n\nBecause wanting to fit in/be in the same activities as friends is a perfectly reasonable desire that - lbr - is often stronger in high school girls than boys. She wants to fit in, but you don't want her to try for no reason at all.\n\n> My reasoning is sound\n\nNo it's not.\n\n> Its too dangerous\n\nplaying a contact sport like your son likely is and you're trying to push her into is more dangerous - again, concussions can affect the rest of your life, and as a lot of tragic incidents have shown, even kill kids if severe enough. when that's a reason to turn them towards TT/chess instead of regular sports, *maybe* you have a leg to stand on there.\n\nYTA. Let your kid live her own life.\n\n**EDIT:** Oh, this is also not considering the fact that your kid might not make the team - so you're currently preventing her even trying out. Like I said, cheerleading's as strenuous as a sport, and you kind of need to be good at it to make a team.\n\n**EDIT 2:** A lot of people are pointing out that cheer uniforms are sexualised by nature, and OP isn't out of line by pointing that out. It's a valid point, but there are two issues there: based on OP's other comments, his kid is 13, so I doubt said cheer uniforms are showing ass and cleavage. It's not an NFL level set up where there's more skin on display than not and it's a legitimate concern - it's not even 16-18 year old girls pushing the dress code and uniforms to the limit. It's 13 year old kids. Also, OP has also said that he'd be okay with volleyball and swim - both sports that are played in swimsuits, which undoubtedly cover less than whatever the cheer uniform is for 13 year olds at OP's kids' school. So, OP's *is* sexualising kids here - his issue is with *cheer uniforms in particular,* not skimpy clothing in general, and 13 year olds in any uniforms should never be sexualised, I don't care what your porn searches filled with consenting adult performers are about. Cheer uniforms do not automatically make a child a sexual object.\n\n**EDIT 3:** Another issue that's been brought up is injuries and cheerleading. I acknowledge that I was not as informed on it as I should have been, but as several other commentators have pointed out, injuries are a side-effect of any sports. Even e-sports carry the risk of carpal tunnel. OP's kid is 13, so to start, I doubt they are doing any showy stunts like the ones one TV and film - it's probably a couple of jumps and flailing arms, and at most a couple of high kicks. *Even if I'm wrong about this,* there are ways to minimise risk without banning the kid from being on the team - again, as others have pointed out, let her be a part of it as long as she's not a flier, for one. If the concern is lack of adequate first aid/trained coaches *at the school* (because that's where OP should focus, not national level estimates), then that's a different matter and a logical reason to have her not compete, as opposed to OP's current reasoning.\n\n**EDIT 4:** On the friend issue - based on the rest of OP's post, I'm very hesitant to take the 'she said my kid would be a loser if she wasn't cheerleading' part at face value. It's simply thrown in there, to try and provide an additional argument on his side, and he doesn't seem to have any concern that if it is true, that the friendship itself is toxic. It's cheerleading that's the issue, and he's willing to throw anyone under the bus for a favorable response. My guess? The friend said something on the lines of 'everyone thought you were a loser in middle school, maybe this will help you become more popular like you want to.' Not the nicest thing to say either, but a far cry from the way OP portrayed it, and essentially a frank conversation between friends versus bullying from the resident \"mean girl.\"\n\nMy ultimate issue with OP is his reasoning seems to be simply 'I don't like it and don't think it's a sport' - none of his arguments are well-reasoned, and the holes are large and varied. The most honest he is about his position in his post, I think, is when he says:\n\n> I'm still like...fuck that shit. My reasoning is sound.\n\nTo him, he's right, and the story ends there, regardless of what his kid(s) or wife have to say.",

It may be more common to wear the shorter shorts, and possibly even recommended, but at least in my experience, it's not a requirement (at high school level, anyway). In the case of volleyball, the spandex may even be advantageous because it's less likely to hit the net and get the ref to call you on it.
