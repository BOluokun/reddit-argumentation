  "post content": "My friend and I are in a rigorous academic program. For the past year he has requested that I remind him of small deadlines constantly and it gets annoying. He will not remember when to register for classes, or when to submit tests, or when to tune into certain zoom meetings etc. I have a lot of responsibilities myself and it gets tiring having to remind him of things. Also, I will have to answer a million questions because he wont read the emails the university sends him and that further sucks up more time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I usually remind him of deadlines but I didn\u2019t remind him of this past one that was very important. It was a training for off campus online behavior and it had to be submitted and done by a certain date or you would be forced to withdrawal from the semester. It took less than 20 minutes to complete and I did it almost immediately after receiving the email informing us we needed to do it and the deadline. We subsequently got like six more emails reminding us to take the training program. So I reminded him of it on the first day we got the email, but then I didn\u2019t remind him again. I wanted to see if he would remember on his own or if he would have the kindess to remind me to do it, because it was a very important deadline. So anyways, the deadline came and went and he didn\u2019t complete the training.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe was really mad at me that I didn\u2018t remind him and called me an asshole. I could have reminded him, but I didn\u2019t and now he has to drop out of school for the semester. I think I might be the asshole because I could have reminded him, but I intentionally did not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: So I have told him I was sick of picking up slack for him. I did not specifically tell him on reminding him of deadlines and stuff, but for things like him forgetting his wallet. etc. Just to be very clear on this, it wasn\u2019t for an expirement, but I have reached the end of my rope with having to constantly help him keep track of things and I have let him know that too. I just never spoke to him specifically about deadlines. I am exhausted with him and his needs to be honest, I have gotten frustrated and firmly told him that I am sick of it and I need to focus on myself and my own health and schooling",

You should have done the adult thing and announced it to him clearly and directly you're no longer keeping track of his deadlines. But this seems an awfully steep consequence while he trusted you.\n\nAlso, I'm going to downright say it - the lack of ability to keep deadlines combined with your edit about him losing his wallet all the time sounds a lot like adult ADHD and he should get tested.",
