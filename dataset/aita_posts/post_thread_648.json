  "post content": "I'm basically at the point of breaking off me relationship with my fianc\u00e9 because I'm so frustrated by this whole thing. I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\nEdit: it's 5:30 here, car service picked her up at 5:15. I guess it's up to fate now if I'm a controlling asshole or if she didn't see it whatever is coming coming.\n\nEdit 2: she just got home and said only \"I don't want to fucking talk about it\" and she's back talking to who I assume is her sister. I'm defying my every desire to eves drop so I don't know what happened. It's only 8:45 so I don't think anything super crazy happened. I'm just glad she's home. If it's appropriate, I'll update again when I know more.\n\nEdif3: this really doesn\u2019t pertain to aita anymore rather just people asking for an update...she gets to dinner and it\u2019s just she, coworker and boss in a private dining room at hotel. Boss says strait up hes banging other girl and wants fianc\u00e9 to join them. Has \u201cunderstanding\u201d with his wife and says he can do amazing things for fianc\u00e9. Fianc\u00e9 is pissed she didn\u2019t see this coming, but she\u2019s still pissed at me for being controlling. She\u2019s not happy at all and talking about breaking up. Sucks All around but I\u2019m relieved she\u2019s safe. Just giving her some space for a while.",

To me, it was just my friend checking in to make sure I was ok (he knew my ex was abusive).

Saying \"can't\" is much more different \"won't\". If you had said you wouldn't let her go, then you would be an asshole. If you had physically barred her from going through the door, you would be an asshole. If you had followed her to the restuarant, then possibly confronted her boss when it turned out you were right, you would be an asshole. But you didn't do any of that, other than expressing your opinion through the word \"can't\".\n\nEven more so, people are expecting absolute perfection during moments of high tensions. That's a common trend with this subreddit, as if everyone has perfect composure during an argument. Granted, \"can't\" wasn't the best word to use, depending on your relationship, bit it definitely isn't in any way controlling. \n\nI would say your fiance is TA in this situation, especially with her behaviour afterwards. I get that she's angry that she didn't analyze the situation correctly, but she had no right to take it out on you and *incorrectly* call you controlling. I think you need to both sit down and talk things out and that you personally need to evaluate your relationship. Not saying break off the engagement or end things, but this behaviour is a bit intense for a supposed grown woman. \n\nI just think it's a bit weird, honestly, that she's in HR and didn't recognize these signs. How is she supposed to be a valuable member if she couldn't even see for herself that the situation was weird. She seems to be completely in denial and needs to report her boss or even find another job, because this situation is going to blow up, either with the second girl or the boss.",

That her boss will force her and the co-worker into a threesome or something?\n\nWell as you can see after all OP's edits it exactly the opposite of what you said. You shouldn't be so naive. This is super obvious where two young females with a boss are having a \"dinner\".\n\nAnd it's not even about OP's trust in her gf, it's more about a chance that boss is a creep and can put a roofy in her drink and then what?",

I now see that I worded myself badly.\n\nWhat I meant was more along the lines of \"So what if it's likely that her boss is just setting her up for a threesome or something similar?\".\n\nEven though it's expected, I think it's best to trust your wife and let her go if she's so adamant about it. If she loves you she's just gonna walk out of there if it actually is something sexual. And that's what happened here.\n\nYou are right though that the boss can roofy her, but at that point there's no good outcome in this situation. Either you forcefully prevent your wife to go, which will very likely mean the end of the relationship because it comes across as controlling, or she gets raped because of her stubborness.\n\nIt's just a shitty scenario overall, and I'm inclined to give the benefit to letting her go to the \"dinner\". Because as I said, if you don't it's probably gonna be the end anyway.\n\n\nI also think that the boss wouldn't be dumb enough to rape her in this scenario, which just further makes me tend to let her go. There would be way too much evidence. \"Oh so you went on a dinner with two women and one of them (or both) just randomly blacked out?\" That's a pretty hard case to fight against as the rapist.",

I've already explained why \"letting her go\" is the better option, but all in all this was just a very shitty situation.\n\n- You prevent her from going: she will see you as a controlling asshole and probably end the relationship.\n\n- You let her go: (1) it's actually a nice dinner [obviously not], or, (2) boss tries to fuck her; maybe she'll decline [best outcome], maybe accept [shitty outcome], maybe get raped [very unlikely because boss knows how much evidence there'd be against him], who knows?\n\nSo, pick your venom.\n\nNever did I say OP was an asshole for being scared, for being suspicious, for being protective. He becomes an asshole if he physically prevents her from going.\n\nIf her health is in apparent danger, you could try calling the cops. But obviously in this scenario there's way too little proof to say boss is most definitely gonna rape her. So the next best thing you can do is trust her.\n\nI do think in hindsight that I should've been a little more harsher on the fianc\u00e9e's naivety.
