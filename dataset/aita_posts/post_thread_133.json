  "post content": "For context: I (21M) was just invited tonight to a cousin's (56 F) birthday party to take place in a restaurant at my city. She's actually my mom's cousin and that's why she is that much older.\n\nI was not originally invited because of the size of the venue, but the location changed and now I am invited to go.\n\nIt is important to notice that my cousin has this conception of \"kids\" to anyone who is younger than 30 years old aproximately, so I would be considered a kid on her party even though I do drink, dance and share with others that are not actually my age but family still.\n\nNow, I was invited to go to the party but, as my mom said, there is a little \"condition\" in case I go. It would be that \"if any other guest who is older than me comes, and does not have a seat, I must give them my seat at the table and spend the night standing\". It is important to notice that the party includes dinner, so I would have to, most likely, stand while everyone is eating and chatting.\n\nThe reason for this whole issue is that my cousin only booked for 50 seats, but will have more than 50 guests, and me being a last time guest, would have to be under those conditions.\n\nThe first thing I tols my mom when she told me that, was that I wasn't going, but she might need some help to keep an eye on my dad for some out of context circumstances related to medical issues that doesn't allow him to fluently comunicate. \n\nAfter listening to that I said that I would think about going, but that if I had to spend the night standing because of someone else wanting my seat, I would be leaving in the spot, calling a taxi and going back home without saying a word to anyone.\n\nMy mom said that it would be rude to do it, and disrespectful, and in case I'm thinking on doing that, I shouldn't go\n\nMy question is, would I be the A hole if I did that? Or should I simply not go",

Therefore etiquette demands THEY ensure YOUR comfort. \n\nIt's monumentally disrespectful to force a guest to stand against a wall with a plate of food while watching everyone else have a lovely dinner. I would personally feel so uncomfortable if I saw this situation unfold and would seriously call out the host. It's one thing to voluntarily give up your sheet, it's another to force someone to give up their seat because in your mind a younger adult is still a child.\n\nAlso, it sounds like your mom only wants you there so she can fob your dad off on you while she parties the night away.",
