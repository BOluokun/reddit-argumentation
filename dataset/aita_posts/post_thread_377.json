She got really upset, got off me and went to her room and slammed the door. \n\nShe hasnt tried to get in my lap since then and things are tense between us. She doesnt talk to me unless she has to and when I hugged her goodnight last night she didnt hug me back. \n\nI feel really guilty because I obviously hurt her feelings but I feel like she might be too old for sitting on my lap. \n\nAITAH",

That's part of helping a child grow up.  But you do need to redirect them to a behavior that *is* appropriate (because they need to be taught, they don't automatically know) and reinforce that while your relationship with them is changing, your love for them is consistent.  If you literally told her to \"Get off\" with no warning, it's no wonder why she perceived that as rejection and is now completely confused as to what sort of physical affection is ok or will get her snapped at.",

When I was a kid, my mom showed a ton of affection, but by 10-11, it stopped. \n\nI KNOW my mom loves me, but it was quite a culture shock when I had a friend going through a rough situation and we cuddled platonically. \n\nIt felt so nice to be close - not sexual at all - but it also felt taboo. \n\nI try to surround myself with people who are not averse to physical contact because I like to be physically close to my friends, but I hate that I feel the stigma still. \n\nI'm guessing this is something that was passed down, or a nosy grandparent said something that had you questioning yourself, but from the perspective of a 32 year old male, i would tell you without a doubt if my parents wanted to show that kind of physical connection, I would jump at the chance.\n\nI speculate it actually reinforces positive interaction and helps people from becoming averse to touch. \n\nJust remember that while this is a hiccup, you didn't permanently ruin something.

I was very underweight and small when I got out and it had been so tough I actually risked trying to cuddle my mum.\n\nShe reacted like you and as I already knew she was unsafe comfort wise, I absorbed the message girls must not get bigger. And the disordered eating I had became full blown eating disorder. I am 44 and still not entirely recovered from my restrictive eating disorder. \n\nI am no contact with my whole family because you know what else happens? People defer to the boundaries mom and dad set with pre teen kids usually. They mirror that so if mom says you are too old for X they don\u2019t want to compromise a child by saying \u2018no but its ok if this adult is different with you and touches you.\u2019 They assume you are parenting this way for a reason. It doesn\u2019t occur to people that reason is not good. I learned everyone in my family didn\u2019t hug me because they deferred to my mum\u2019s rule thinking as my parent it was to undermine her or harm me (such as infantilizing your smaller than average daughter). So that support network goes too.\n\nAnd FYI your reply is entirely \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018me\u2019 and how you feel. You haven\u2019t thought how your daughter might feel so that apology is not sounding great based on that. You aren\u2019t saying \u2018I am upset my daughter feels alone\u2019 you are saying \u2018I want to feel less guilty I have a consequence of this.\u2019 You need to set your guilt for you to handle and put your daughter\u2019s needs first. This reads like you will tell her you feel guilty which then makes her carry that on top of your rejection.\n\nThat will just drive this wedge deeper. You can still do a lot here if you approach it well. YTA. If you are now almost crying that your 11 year old needs some space imagine how devastated she was with your blunt \u2018get off me.\u2019 Flip it and it will help the empathy your apology needs.",
