  "post content": "My (F37) family is very close. My husband\u2019s (M51) is not so much. We maybe get together two or three times a year. I don\u2019t think I have ever really hung out with all of them at once for any extended period of time except for our wedding ten years ago. Mostly because everyone is scattered around the country. \n\nMy mother in law is having a milestone birthday this year so she rented an air B and B in a city about equidistant from all of her children to come and gather to celebrate. The task fell upon us to order the cake because she loved our (publix-nothing fancy) wedding cake (raspberry elegance if you\u2019re interested\u2014everyone loved it would highly recommend if you want a wedding cake on the cheap) and wanted a small one for her fete. As we were going to pick it up, my husband asked me, \u201cDid you have them write \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 on it?\u201d I had ordered it online for pick up in the destination state and didn\u2019t see an option for that kind of customization, so I hadn\u2019t. But that got my wheels spinning. \u201cShould I have gotten them to write on the cake? Would it be too impersonal to get her a plain Publix cake? What am I, an asshole daughter in law with no appreciation for milestone birthdays that involve people coming from all corners of the country?\u201d\n\nOnce I got to the bakery counter I nicely asked the bakery employee who assisted me in retrieving my order (and pay special attention to the verbiage I used here), \u201cDo you have and kind of birthday confection or adornment I could buy for the cake?\u201d I was thinking about a time I had gotten a \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d sign with lettering between two stakes or some candy letters, etc. On other occasions. Instead, the bakery employee happily chirped, \u201cOh, would you like me to write on the cake?! I\u2019d be happy to do that!!!\u201d Well her eagerness, enthusiasm, and position as a Publix bakery professional made me have some confidence in her abilities, especially if she was willing to offer her skills (for the most part?) unsolicited. \n\nHere is where things might go to Ass(hole) Vegas: I said yes. I trusted that she knew what she was doing! Was I an asshole for having confidence in her skill? \n\nUnfortunately the asshole train doesn\u2019t end there. She asked me what to write on the cake. My head was spinning. I was thinking I should get \u201cHappy birthday, Mom.\u201d But then I thought, well there are grandchildren there, too. They wouldn\u2019t call her mom, right? I don\u2019t remember a cake for my grandmother ever saying \u201cHappy Birthday, Mom\u201d on it. So I told her to write \u201cHappy Birthday, Elaine.\u201d  I walked off with the cake thinking all was good. \n\nTwo aisles later I run into my husband who sees the cake. The lettering looks like it was done by a fourth grader. Am I the asshole for letting someone \u201cmangle\u201d the cake with an \u201coffice break room\u201d style greeting?",
