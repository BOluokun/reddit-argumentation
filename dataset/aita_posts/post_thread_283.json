  "post content": "I (28m) and have been married to my wife \"Bella\" (28f) for 5 years.\n\nWe both met and went to the same college. She pre-law while I was doing animation. She graduated top of our class and went to a T20 law school. While she was in law school, I had a lot of trouble finding a job in my field or a job at all, really. I ended up working in a kitchen as a line cook to help support us (in addition to loans she took out) while she was going to school so she could just focus on her classes.\n\nBella got a very good job in a different state after she graduated, so I quit my job and haven't gotten another one since. We have no kids, a nice house for the two of us, and are overall living very very comfortably. She works very long hours, so I take care of most of the household things. Cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, re-painting the walls and doing other work and renovations to the house.\n\nIn the last 6 months Bella's started referring to me as her \"house husband\" around our family and friends. I've mostly been letting it go but every single time it bothers me. I'm already insecure about not being able to find a good job and it makes me feel even more inadequate. I finally got to the end of my rope when we were with her mother on Sunday, who still doesn't really approve of me, and they were talking about taking care of the lawn/garden and she said, \"Thank goodness I have a house husband for that or I'd never find the time\" and smiled at me. Then they both laughed. It was humiliating. \n\nI didn't say anything at first but I guess she could tell that I was really upset and asked what was wrong. I told her that she needed to stop emasculating me and making it seem like I didn't contribute anything to the household. We were arguing back and forth and she told me that she would stop calling me a house husband if I was going to \"get that upset about it\" but that it wasn't an untrue term and I needed to stop being insecure. \n\nBella refuses to apologize. I feel like she doesn't fully appreciate my value as her husband. I've stopped doing the chores until she apologizes and she is beyond pissed off. She's been coming home and cooking dinner (only for herself) and doing the chores I haven't and then taking off to spend the night at a friends house. I was talking to my sister about it and she told me that Bella was wrong but I was being immature in my response. The thing is, if I give in she's going to keep thinking what she's been doing is okay. I don't even know anymore. AITA?",

It\u2019s an equal contribution to your family and household. It holds value. It permits your wife to work longer hours at her job, without trying to also maintain the household. \n\nIf your truly unhappy in that role- do something about it.

People aren't mind readers and communication is important.\n\nEdited to add: YTA. Your response is immature. She said she would stop using the term once you expressed your dislike. If you stop doing the household tasks, she could also stop paying for your expenses, including housing and food. It sounds like the deal was, she pays for expenses while you do housework, no?\n\nEdit 2, commented also further down: If I were her, I'd probably laugh after saying it too. It's absurdist humour. A house husband was unheard of not too long ago.\n\nBut I can see how he can take it the wrong way if he is already feeling insecure.\n\nAlso can see how she doesn't want to apologize if she didn't mean it to be demeaning. Apologizing would mean conceding that 'house spouse' is inherently demeaning regardless of intent.\n\nEdit 3: For those that disagree with me, please check OPs comments. He literally says he knows that she didn't mean it in a negative way. He says the phrase 'house husband' is emasculating no matter the context or intent",

She'd recently completed an engineering degree and after a long drought of job hunting, got some good fortune.\n\nI get how it can feel emasculating, I really do, but that's really just your perception and something you need to figure out how to either change or get over. We have three kids old enough to recognize the new dynamic, which adds another layer.\n\nI'm taking the time to complete the education that lost importance when I was working to support us, and plan to renter the workforce, but honestly, that's going to take a back seat to keeping our family running as it's doubtful I could replace her income any time soon.\n\nYou need to decide if you're happy with what you are, and work to change it if not. Her accurate read of the situation doesn't make you less.\n\nI'm reserving asshole judgement, as I'm not clear from the post if she was using the term to degrade you or not. You shouldn't view this any differently than a woman being called a housewife though. That's just silly gender roles and semantics getting at you.\n\nETA: I reread and YTA for refusing to do your job while she continues to do hers. She agreed to stop calling you what you are because it bothered you, which is silly, showing she's the bigger person.",
