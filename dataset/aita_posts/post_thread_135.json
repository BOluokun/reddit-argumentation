  "post content": "Obligatory this is a throwaway because people involved are on reddit.\nI(29M) own my own home (this will be relevant later), my mum (53F) lives with me as she lost her home a couple years ago (long story/not very relevant)\nA year ago she began dating again and met R(47M) and they have been in a Relationship for 6months.\nWhen global issue began I agreed to allow R and his kids (14f,12m) to come live with us.\nNow I've met R enough times that we know each other as friends but not close friends, im just happy my mum is moving on.\nhe immediately began laying down rules he \"expects all the kids to follow\" and I thought fair enough you have rules for your kids its not my business. Of course he put out a reasonable curfew for the kids.\nSo now we get to 48hrs ago, I was feeling cooped up in the house and decided to go for a late night run with me immediately going to bed when I got back.\nWhen I woke up in the morning I went down for breakfast, as I hit the bottom of the stairs the living room door flies open with R on the other side red faced and obviously angry, he immediately shout \"in here now!\". I have no idea whats going on but I assumed it was to do with his kids so I go in and he slams the door shut so I turned and said \"was there any need for that?\" He goes wide eyed and starts going into an agry tirade \"how dare I disrespect his rules\" \"your step brother and sister follow the rules why can't you\" \"under this roof you show me respect, I'm your f***ing stepdad\" through all this im sitting on the coffee table in disbelief, getting angrier by the second, eventually he finished blasting off but not before his kids and my mum come down to see whats going on.\nThis may be where I am the a**hole.\nI stood up and pretty much stood nose to nose (yeah  its intimidating behaviour, my first mistake) and I just let rip. I asked him how dare he talk to me this way in my house, im a grown man, I do not follow your rules under my roof, if you can't handle that then get out you aren't my stepfather, you are my mothers boyfriend and we will never have the sort of relationship you clearly misled yourself into thinking we do, I expect an apology\". he packed his things and took his kids back to his own home, my mum said there was no need for me to be that nasty and accused me of going too far for embarrassing her boyfriend in front of his kids and undermining his parenting,now she's giving me the silent treatment.\n.....................................................................................\nFinally ready to update, so thanks to everyone for your comments and dm's on the original post, im going to answer some questions before I update.\n\n1. Yes R was well aware when moving in that it would be my house he is staying in.\n\n2. I'm not kicking my mum out, she needs a therapist not a change of address.\n\n3. To those who were curious about my parents marriage and how it ended, dad was controlling and manipulative and he hid it well, just like he hid his girlfriends. There were no fights or divorces, he was my dad and I do care, but he played away with the wrong woman and paid the ultimate price on her car bonnet, its sad, but I cant be angry about it.\n\n4. To the idiot who decided to assign race by behaviour, keep that garbage to yourself, aholes come in all colours and creeds.\n\nSo on with the update, probably gonna be quite short\n\nAfter finally talking with my mother she has apologised, she wasn't fully aware of what had gone on and thought I had been the one to start the argument. \nWe spoke about Rs behaviour and agreed this wasn't someone she needed in her life and that she needed a therapist.\n\nRather than come himself R decided to send his elderly parents around to talk with us, I was polite but made it clear I wouldnt be discussing this with them and instead asked them about the children's current situation, in short they are back with their mum and she is aware of Rs behaviour, she is not happy with him.\nR seems to be laying low for now and knows his relationship with my mum is over.\n\nFinally, I decided against charging for damage, the simple fact is getting him away from my family as quick as possible is worth more than a door frame and a cheap wall sconce.\n\nSorry its not an interesting update, but at least its a closed book now.",

She accused me of making it up and I just stopped and said, \"how many holes are in the walls of out parents house that they haven't bothered to fix? And what about the few they did fix? She told me I was an asshole. But my dad would pull my hair, push me, scream in my face, spit on me, and a few times worse. But mostly he stuck to being in my face and spitting. He and my mom are stalking me. They have a no trespassing notice. So, they stood on the sidewalk with their new dog and called to my kids. A lawyer said because I can't prove they are recently violent (because I won't let him near me to hurt me) I can't get a restraining order. This man has a paint ball gun with ball bearings and pepper spray. He told the police he was going to do what he wanted and no one could deny him access. But since these are my parents, even though I am an adult with kids of my own, I am treated like their property.\n\nThey even got the damn police to knock on our door a week before Christmas and asked us to come to the station so my parents could give my kids a special Christmas. The officer seemed to not understand that they used him because they couldn't step foot onto our property legally! We had to remind him of the violence and he told us to lock our doors and call if they showed up. At least the house they are building behind us is to a family with a police officer in it. At least my kids and husband can run for help when my dad eventually snap sand murders me (which I am convinced he will).",
