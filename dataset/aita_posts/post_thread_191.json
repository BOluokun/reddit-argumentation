  "post content": "My ex and I had our son when we were young and neither of us were at all equipped to become parents. We made the decision to put him up for adoption. The couple that adopted him were very open about keeping communication every now and then to let us know how he\u2019s doing and that they\u2019d tell him about us. \n\nThey eventually moved and lost contact when he was 2. \n\nI am now 33 and have been in a relationship with my fianc\u00e9e for over 2 years. Since we were dating I always made it known I had a son I gave up for adoption and there was a chance he\u2019d make contact in the future. \nShe always said she was fine with that but now my biological son (18m) has messaged me wanting to meet and she was suddenly against it.\n\nApparently now that it\u2019s actually happening, she\u2019s having second thoughts and doesn\u2019t like the idea of a stranger coming into our lives. We talked about this at length. For one thing it was possible he doesn\u2019t even want me to become a part of his life and maybe only wants a one time meeting to ask questions.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e was still against me meeting him at all until I told her this was *my* decision in the end and I\u2019d like to meet him. \n\nSo that\u2019s what I did. It was an awkward and somewhat emotional experience but it was so wonderful to see the young man he grew up to be. In my mind he was always that 2 year old I saw in pictures and now I\u2019ve gotten the chance to see him all grown up. \n\nWe met at a park and talked for a long time. Learned about his life, answered his questions. He\u2019s open to us continuing to talk and while he\u2019s not expecting me to take on a fatherly role in his life, would like it if we got to know eachother better.\n\nThat\u2019s where we left off and when I got home my fianc\u00e9e was being cold (I had told her ahead of time what day I\u2019d be meeting him). She said she felt hurt that I disregarded her feelings on this and made it seem like what she thought didn\u2019t matter.\n\nThings have been rocky ever since, she\u2019s giving me the silent treatment and it\u2019s started to make me question if going through with this- knowing she wasn\u2019t on board - was an a-hole thing of me to do. Just ignoring her feelings on this and going ahead with the meeting. \n\nWould like to know what others think.",

In case you can't see it, here are all the ways she's tried to manipulate you:\n\n1. Lied to you for over two years by saying that she'd be fine with you meeting your son someday.\n2. When that day actually came and he contacted you, suddenly she decided she was strongly against it.\n3. After a long discussion in which you laid out your reasons for wanting to meet him, she tried to convince you not to go through with it without offering any sensible explanations as to why.\n4. You respectfully told her the decision was yours and you were going to meet him anyway and she's been giving you the cold shoulder and silent treatment ever since. \n\nPsychologists consider the silent treatment a form of abuse because it is a form of punishment intended to hurt and control the other person. Your fianc\u00e9e didn't get what she wanted, so she's trying to make you feel guilty for \"not respecting her feelings\" when, in fact, that's the exact opposite of what's happened. She is not respecting *your* feelings or autonomy.\n\nYou were completely honest with her from the very start of your relationship two years ago about the existence of your son and the fact that you may meet him some day in the future and when that day came, you were upfront with her, listened to her POV, and ultimately made the decision that you felt best. \n\nShe has done none of those things with you and instead reacted with coldness and hostility. Just because you disagreed with her, it doesn't mean you've disrespected her feelings and her trying to say that it does is manipulative and problematic. This is a preview into what you can expect from her whenever you disagree with her opinion. Tread carefully.",

There is no evidence in the OP to support even the notion that OP's gf wanted to pretend she was the only women in OP's life, especially if he was upfront about having a kid in the past. The leap in logic required to 'pretend you were the only woman ever' isn't something that matters to most in the real world, again outside of such incel circles.\n\nMost 30 year olds understand that if you tell them you have a kid out there that you aren't the only romantic interest they've ever had, that's not a difficult concept for most to grasp and understand, or even have an issue with. Normal people don't have an issue with the fact that their current partner has had other partners before.\n\nShe is definitely not acting ok here, and not treating OP like a decent partner, but to assume that it must be because she's pretending he's never fucked anybody before he met her says lots more about about the maturity levels of the person suggesting that than it does about anybody actually in the story.",

I never felt negative toward his daughter, she was/is a sweetheart.  But it felt like he had this special relationship, like he was best friends with an ex-girlfriend or something and it was something important I could never share and I knew that wasn\u2019t right, but I don\u2019t think I ever got over feeling that way.\n\nOur relationship ended over other things totally unrelated to his daughter, but I think you are right, a therapist might have helped me work through those feelings.

It's nothing to do with another woman and everything to do with feeling threatened she'll have to share his attention. She's an AH, but it's also very understandable. Plenty of people don't want to date single parents, for example. There's part of her that fears being replaced or suddenly being relegated to second place.\n\nA therapist would help her to work through those feelings, so I hope she goes to talk to someone. She'll also find support groups online for other people and families who have gone through this exact thing.",

You told her two years ago you had a son who might one day want to make contact. Just from that description, I would have assumed that you would open to contact \u2014 or, it would have gone, \u201cI had a kid when I was young, we put him up for adoption, but I just felt you should know before getting legally entangled with me because that would be a weird surprise later on.\u201d\n\nBut even though she knew you were open to contact if the kid ever reached out, when that happened, she tried to prevent it. Now, her suddenly being less okay with it than she thought is understandable; it\u2019s an emotionally-complicated situation, and maybe she felt differently in the moment than she thought she feel two years previously. But her feeling different does not give her the right to alter your behavior. This is between you and your child (and, I suppose, his mother). She has no say, no matter what her say might have been.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of other advice being shared in this thread, and they\u2019re right. You should attempt to talk with her about why she\u2019s feeling the way she is, and it\u2019s possible that this may be a red flag for your impending marriage. But as far as whether you are in the right or not\u2026don\u2019t worry, OP. NTA",
