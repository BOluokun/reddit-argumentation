  "post content": "Context: I (20F) am going to school at a university (this is important for context). My mom has not ever really supported the fact I wanted to go to a bigger school as she went to community college. About 2 years ago I was in a car accident and I decided to sue the person responsible for the accident (damages were over $10K, medical bills over $30k). My vehicle was beyond repair and insurance only offered me $1,500 after it was all said and done. I tried everything and I am left with severe neck and back pain. I also have trouble with strength in my arms and legs. The driver drove drunk and hit me going at an unreasonable amount of speed. It lead to my car flipping over multiple times and needing surgery after. \n\nRecently we went to court and although I only asked for $55K in court, the judge required him and his insurance company to pay $150K to me for damages, medical, and as personal relief as well. I just got the first part of the check on Monday and my mom insisted I give her the entire check ($25K) so she can have some spending money. After I told her no and told her I would be using it for college expenses as I still have three years left, she told me I am not responsible enough to handle it. I explained I am meeting with an accountant on Friday and we are going to open up an account specifically for this and I won\u2019t touch the money unless I absolutely need to. She still didn\u2019t like that and called me the a-hole for not giving her the check. Her biggest reason after I talked to my grandma was \u201cI gave her life. I\u2019m entitled to something\u201d. I am really considering cutting contact with my mom if she continues to behave this way but I am wanting to better my future. So AITA for this?\n\nEdit: Wow. Thank you all so much for the advice. I am blown away by this community I\u2019m not gonna lie. You all have really helped me see what I thought I was in the wrong for. I did end up calling both an accountant and financial advisor and we have a game plan set for where money will be going. I also decided I am going to start a will in the event something were to happen to me. I have that attorney appointment next week. I am gonna be nice and give my mom something out of that but if she goes before me, I can easily have it fixed. On the other hand, my fianc\u00e9 and I both had a sit down conversation with my mom. We not only showed her some of the comments on this post but explained to her the necessity of me still having an education and job after I get the last few checks. I am going to school to work in business/healthcare management so who knows\u2026. In 10 years I could be a board member of a hospital or running my own hospital lol. Mom did finally see where she was in the wrong and apologized but that isn\u2019t going to fix everything right now. I still don\u2019t trust her but time will tell how she feels. Thank you all again for helping me because honestly I really felt like at some point I\u2019d have to give her my money. So seriously everyone thank you!\n\nUpdate: Hey y\u2019all, it\u2019s been a few months so I wanted to let you guys know my progress. My money is currently secure in a savings account that only I can access. It\u2019s with a bank I do not typically bank with and no one but my MIL knows the name of the bank. She has been really supportive and helpful through this process. I have been making major progress in physical therapy and should be done by summer of next year. I also joined a sorority at my college and while I know probably not the best money move, the benefits outweighed the cons for me. My mom and I are also both going through intense individual and family therapy to help with our issues that have stemmed back for years before the settlement. So we are working things out but right now, I am not living with her nor am I financially supporting her. My fianc\u00e9 (as of October) just found out we were pregnant and will be telling his mom on Christmas. We are very excited for what seems to be a bright future ahead of us. My financial advisor has also helped set up my account to where a small portion was put into a stock that is doing really well at the moment and I plan to sell it before the recession. Overall, I\u2019m doing well guys. Thank you all again for your opinions. I have really appreciated it.",

It was a large amount, as she had injuries that would trouble her for the rest of her life and even keep her from ever having kids.\n\nYou would not believe the things her parents spent it on. Improvements to their whole house (she got her own bedroom), a huge in-ground pool (for her physical therapy), pretty much every other expense she had down to groceries came out of the money, even the car they bought to drive her to doctor's appointment. Lo an behold, by the time she graduated high school, it was pretty much gone. \n\nAnd then they sold the house and pocketed all the extra money gained from the improvements and remodeling that she paid for. She didn't even get the damn car.\n\nDo not give anyone a dime, that judge didn't slap all that extra money on there for no reason, you are going to need every penny of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA",
