  "post content": "My girlfriend (25F) and I (29M) live in NYC and there's a popular app where you buy leftover restaurant food. Restaurants advertise \"surprise bags\" at a reduced price in order to reduce foodwaste. The customer doesn't know what they're getting until they pick the food up, but the cost at least 3x lower than the normal menu price. (EG if an entree is usually $24, the restaurant is allowed to charge $8 at most for it.) These are hit or miss - sometimes you get exactly what you want at a greatly reduced price, but sometimes you get something that you otherwise wouldn't have picked from the menu.\n\nI ordered a surprise bag from a barbecue place that I was picking up on the way home yesterday. I texted my girlfriend asking if she wanted one but she said no, she wasn't in the mood for barbecue. However, there was an indian restaurant right next door that also had surprise bags available on the app, so she ordered one of them. The barbecue was $12 and the indian food was $10.\n\nWhen I get home I unpack the meals to see what we got. I was psyched about my bag. Since I paid $12 I knew the value had to be at least $36, but honestly the platter looked a lot more expensive. This was a hit. (Keep in mind that we live in the west village, which is the most expensive neighborhood in the most expensive city in the US, so $36 for one meal is pretty typical.) There were burnt ends, ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, potato salad, bread, onions, and pickles.\n\nMy girlfriend, however, was  less lucky. Her surprise bag only had 6 different types of soup, half of them being variations on cauliflower soup. She was disappointed to say the least. She asked if we should share my barbecue and I said no, i'm hungry, I offered to buy you some already and you said no, so I'm going to devour it.\n\nShe got mad and called me the asshole. I told her if she didn't want soup she should have ordered something specifically instead of using the surprise bag app. I then told her to just order something off a food delivery app. She said she didn't want to spend the money (another bit of context is I make a lot more money than her and pay all of our rent, I know she's running a bit of a lean financial picture right now.) I then tell her that if she doesn't want to pay for delivery, I'll walk to the bodega on our street and can buy her something there. (Another bit of context is that we live on a 4th floor walkup with no elevator and she broke her leg in a car accident a month ago, so it can be tough for her to get around.) She says she the grill is probably off there and all she wants is a hot meal. I tell her she has soup.\n\nAnyway, she thinks I'm the asshole. But in my defense:\n\n(1) I offered to buy her barbecue to begin with, which she declined.\n\n(2) she picked out her own food and I grabbed it for her on my way home\n\n(3) when she wasn't satisfied, I suggested two solutions (either ordering something from an app or going to a bodega)\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?",

You know she can\u2019t afford to order something else but didn\u2019t offer to help pay, you offered her crappy bodega food instead. You could have at least split the barbecue and ordered something else to share and split the price. If the situations were reversed and you\u2019d gotten a bunch of crap soup while she had a feast, would you really want to sit there hungry waiting for some crappy alternative while she chowed down?\n\nYou\u2019re going to get lots of N T A that just have no concept of\u2026being nice and making small sacrifices  for your partner. You and them seem like the types who if their meal companion gets the wrong meal at a restaurant and has to wait half an hour for a new one, they\u2019ll sit there and eat and not even offer a fry.\n\nEdit to add: ffs guys, I lived in NYC for a decade, I know bodegas have good food. The *grill was closed*. Her options would have been *maybe* a deli sandwich if they were still making them, but it could very well have just been like, chips and cookies. She wanted a real dinner.",

I would never sit there and not share my food with my partner under any circumstances let a lone when they were disappointed with there food, had a broken leg and couldn\u2019t financially afford to get any more.

I then ordered pasta and soup. She ordered the same as me while the brother had something else.\n\nWhen our dishes were served, her brother got his meal and my friend got her pasta and soup but my order wasn't there yet. I asked the server about my food. Apparently they thought we were only ordering one soup and pasta. I corrected the server and she apologized and said that it would probably take another 30 minutes or less.\n\nThe siblings began eating while I waited for my food. I asked my friend if I could have her soup because I'm really hungry and she can have mine when it came since we ordered the same anyways. She told me no, then promptly took a spoonful of the soup maybe so I wouldn't insist. I understood that she was hungry but so was I, and I thought being friends she would give me the soup while waiting so I can eat something and not just sit there hungry while they are eating. I felt a bit upset and hurt with what she did but kept my mouth shut because she I didn't want to ruin her visit. I never went to eat with the siblings again.",

So we would probably split/share whatever the thing is, or get more, or sometimes she'd get it and sometimes she'd refuse. But the point is, **every outcome in which we value the other's joy, we both win.** Every outcome that we dont risks at least one of us being unhappy, and possibly both of us. **The answer is so fucking obvious - be generous with your loved ones.** It's really that simple. OP could've had 2/3rds of his BBQ, enjoyed a soup or two of his choice, and still come out of it full, satisfied, having had a bargain of a feast, and looking like the hero. Instead, he chose to look like an ass. How sad.\n\nWhy the fuck would anyone ever be as selfish and petty as OP and do their best Gollum impression over some fucking BBQ when they could be a loving, caring partner and have both people be happy? If your partner's joy doesn't spark joy for yourself, to the point that you need to maximize your own happiness at the cost of theirs, you need to find a better relationship.",

It was entirely luck that he got a great meal. To me it's like, why even be in a relationship if your reaction to a difficulty for your partner is \"sorry you had a difficulty, git gud scrub\". And if she can't trust him to ease a difficulty when it comes to dinner, how can she trust him for anything serious?",

That's ignoring that the app has supermarkets on, so you can also reduce your grocery bill by buying those and just cooking with whatever you get the same day.\n\nEven societally, the grocery bags and carvery type meals are a lot healthier than the comparable price processed foods. The bags from supermarkets are 90% fruit, veg, meats and bread. It might help with the obesity crisis, at least as far as it is caused by affordability rather than laziness and gluttony.\n\nAnd then the reduction in food waste reduces the demand for habitat destruction, overuse of land and water, and saves it from releasing methane in a landfill.\n\nWe need more stuff like Too Good To Go.",
