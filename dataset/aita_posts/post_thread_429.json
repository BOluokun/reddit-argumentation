  "post content": "Throwaway account and fake names because my wife is also on Reddit. And sorry for the long post. \n\nMy wife (39F) and I (42M) have three sons, Alex (15), Dylan (11), and Jake (8). When I was a kid I always wanted a dog but my parents said no. I never got the chance to get one during my twenties but recently my interest in owning one was sparked again so I asked my family what they thought about getting a dog. My wife wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about it but she relented after a few weeks of me asking. Alex and Jake were excited to get one but Dylan was immediately opposed to the idea. \n\nDylan was always different than my other sons, he never had an interest in sports and was always more subdued than his brothers which has always made it hard for me to connect with him. \n\nHe remained opposed to the idea of getting a dog but me and my other sons managed to wear him down until he finally relented. However, he said that if we did get a dog, he wasn\u2019t going to be interacting with it or taking care of it, that would be completely on me and his brothers. I found this ridiculous but i agreed in the moment hoping he would change his mind after meeting the dog. \n\nThe problem is he hasn\u2019t changed his mind yet. We\u2019ve had Zeus for seven months now and Dylan has not warmed up to him in the slightest. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t play with the dog, he doesn\u2019t cuddle with him, he doesn\u2019t let Zeus into his room because he \u201cdestroys stuff\u201d and whenever he is near the dog he just ignores him. I find this completely ridiculous. Zeus loves Dylan, he follows him around whenever he sees him and jumps on him to get his attention and play but Dylan just isn\u2019t receptive to it.\n\nTo change this, I told Dylan last week that he would be in charge of walking the dog every day after school. Dylan straight up refused and has shut down the conversation every time I bring it up. It\u2019s been a week and he hasn\u2019t walked the dog once. \n\nIn my frustration, I told him that if he didn\u2019t start listening then I wouldn\u2019t allow him to go to the comic book store anymore and he freaked and told my wife. Now, my wife is upset with me, claiming that I knew what I was getting into with this and I knew that Dylan wouldn\u2019t be playing with the dog but his intolerance of the dog is weird and I refuse to entertain it any longer. \n\nMy wife has been short with me ever since that conversation and Dylan is cold with me as well. Alex is now agreeing with his mother which is making me have second thoughts. So Reddit, AITA?",

You are always supposed to train your dog to heel/down and not jump on people. And as another commenter pointed out, a dog that is prone to jumping up on/at people, is likely a difficult dog to walk. And the name Zeus would also lead me to believe it\u2019s a fairly large dog, too\u2026 a dog too difficult for an 11 yr old to walk.\n\nAnd the fact the dad is writing \u201cdestroys things\u201d exactly like that, tells me that he 1. Has no respect for his kiddos belongings that are being destroy by a dog he **did not want** and 2. Reinforces that this dog is not being trained at all.\n\nEdit: YTA big time!",

Let's try out a class together and see if we like it!\n\nMy dad loves sports, which not one of the 4 of his kids care about at all. He is so not into musical theatre that he fell asleep during Wicked, which I feel like is almost impressive because it is pretty loud. \n\nWhy was he *at* Wicked? Because I was really really into it as a teenager and wanted to go for ages so for my birthday he got us tickets and went, and even though he did fall asleep he asked about what he missed and talked about it with me and my sister and listened to it in the car with us. Again, he REALLY was not interested in that, but he did it for his kids. He gets soooooo bored and fidgety at museums and is not very interested in art, but he would take us to the art museum anyway, and didn't even complain about me wanting to read every caption in the rooms I was particularly interested in. And we sometimes go to Sox games with him, even though we do not care about it at all, because he loves going with us. But we do that because we want to, because he's a good dad, not because he pressures us to go with him or to love sports.",
