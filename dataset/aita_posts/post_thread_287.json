  "post content": "This is an ongoing issue going on in my home. I 33F am currently pregnant with my first child. I live in a two bedroom home with my husband and step-daughter (23F). Step-daughter and I get along fine no big issues but we also are not super close.\n\nNow that the baby is coming we need more space unfortunately we can't afford a new home. I brought up to my husband asking Step-daughter to move out. My reasoning is that we really need her room for the new baby and she is an adult with a full time job so it is time for her to be on her own anyway.\n\nMy husband agreed and we brought it up to her at dinner one night. We told her we would help with her first 2 months rent. I told her it would be fun her and I could go shopping and I will help her decorate her new apartment. We tried to be as gentle as we could but she was very quiet. \n\nPrivately she told my husband that even though she as a full time job she cannot afford to live on her own. My husband told her she did not need to move out so now we are scrambling trying to find space for new baby.\n\nThe other day I was home alone with Step- daughter and tried to talk to her about it again. I offered  to help her find a roommate and she snapped on me. She snapped on me and told me to just leave her alone and locked herself in her room.\n\nWhen my husband got home from work he was mad at me and told me to leave her alone and not bring it up anymore. Things have been awkward and uncomfortable since making my pregnancy very stressful. \n\nShe is 23 old enough to be on her own she has a job and we are willing to help her. We need space for our baby I do not see how I am in the wrong here.",

You can either accept that and push and push and alienate her, deprive the baby of an older sister and ultiamtely alienate the father or, just an idea, find a bigger place where she can continue to live with you WHILST paying a rent so it's affordable.

Most young people cannot afford to leave home and don't particularly want to live with strangers weirdly. And no, I'm older than you, but apparently not quite so callous.

In that time my husband bonded with my boys and became closer to them than I could have imagined. He loved them like he would his own children, even though they were with their dad half the time, but he left discipline and big decisions about their life up to me and their father. Of course we listened to any opinion he might have had.\n\nWe had our first child together when I was in my mid- 30\u2019s and our last one 17 months later. By that time, we were more stable, everyone had plenty of room and my husband had established trust with my kids. When the two other kids were born, we were just a bigger family. \n\nAnd one last thing, I don\u2019t care if my kids are 23 or 53, life is hard people! If any of my kids ever need to come back home to get on their feet financially, emotionally, physically or mentally, our door will always be open and they\u2019ll always have a place to lay their head. We all need a little help sometimes, especially with the world and economy the way it is right now.
