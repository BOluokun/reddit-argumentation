I\u2019m unfortunately the only girl in the house. though I have a great relationship with my older brothers they\u2019re the best big brother ever and I love them so much. I also have a great relationship with my younger brother(14). He\u2019s such an angel, he has literally fallen out of heaven into our family. I love him so so much. We do everything together and we are inseparable. \nMy other younger brother(11) and the rest of my siblings don\u2019t get along with him. I can\u2019t say how the rest feel about him. I tend to avoid him. He\u2019s annoying, he\u2019s destructive, in general awful to be around. \nMy dad is the most amazing dad ever I love him so much. He\u2019s calls me the princess of the house and we love shopping together. It kinda suck I don\u2019t see him often because of his work.\nMy mom is great. She is really strict with everyone except younger Bro(11). \n\n\nI\u2019m a perfume fanatic. I have like 30 perfumes, I recently received Lost cherry by Tom ford as a gift from my dad. It has become my favorite perfume. The scent is so delicious I love it.\n\nThree days ago my brothers 14, 20 and I decided to go to an arcade. My younger brother was at his soccer practice so we couldn\u2019t ask him to go and other brothers had to do other things. We arrived home, I went upstairs to see the door of my room open. I found my favorite perfume on the ground in pieces. I asked him(11) if he did it. He didn\u2019t want to admit it at first but after repeated questioning he ended up admitting to it. I ask him why he felt the need to destroy something I love, why he always had to ruin everything and make our daily lives so much harder. I told my older brothers(21, 20,18) and they scolded him and ask him why he can\u2019t respect our stuff. Mom heard the commotion and immediately took his side as usual. He told my mom some non sense story about how he was just trying to spray my perfume so he could feel closer to me because he feels left out he dropped it by accident he didn\u2019t mean to blah blah. Excuses he knows better than to touch my perfumes. I made it clear that if they ever broke one of my perfumes there would never be a peaceful day in this house ever again.\n\nWe all had to apologize to my brother and are now forced to take him to the arcade and hangout with him. My dads pissed that mom took my brothers side since the perfume he broke was $500. Everyone is having a bad time now because of him\nMom is of course angry with me the most told me it was out of line what I said. I strongly disagree with her it was bound to happen if it wasn\u2019t me it would\u2019ve been my older brothers. She coddles him too much that why he\u2019s like this. My brothers agree with my dad agrees with me she\u2019s the only one that is telling me that I\u2019m in the wrong. Am I the asshole?",

Her father calls her \"the princess of the household\" and gifts her $500 of perfume at 16 years old, and she's surrounded by brothers, older and younger, who apparently adore her and treat her like exactly that: a princess. I can't image being an awkward preteen boy in that household, making mistakes or just . . . being awkward. She sounds like she has absolutely no sympathy or empathy for error or imperfection, or for a youngest sibling who just gets things wrong. She hasn't even accused him of being malicious or nasty, just of being error- and accident-prone, it sounds like, and getting into the usual tween mishaps, and she seems unwilling to give him ANY benefit of the doubt or leeway to be imperfect, or even to include him in things except really reluctantly.\n\nI'd say the Princess of the House is a bit of an AH, considering all of that.",

OP has a hobby which is collecting perfumes. it\u2019s what she likes and what she does. it\u2019s not stated that ALL her perfumes cost $500 just one does. you can get cheap perfumes that still smell really good. they didn\u2019t go to an arcade without the 11yo maliciously. they were probably bored being home alone without mom or dad and wanting to get out of the house and do something fun. it\u2019s not their fault they were bored and didn\u2019t want to wait around for baby bro to be done with soccer practice so all of them could go to the arcade. the family seems pretty well off so i\u2019m definitely not going to assume that OP is coddled by dad cause she has a $500 perfume. if all of your siblings dislike you there is an issue with you and not them. just cause he\u2019s the baby doesn\u2019t mean he gets a get out of jail free card to being an AH. the BS of \u201ci just wanted to be closer to my sister\u201d is just that BS. I understand feeling ostracized but he\u2019s 11 and knows how valuable her perfume collection is to her especially that one bottle so why touch it?? he could\u2019ve just sat in her room or something. he never mentioned wanting to \u201cbe closer\u201d to her until mom came on the scene. i\u2019ve had my fair share of entitled/spoiled cousins. i\u2019ve seen the whole \u201ci\u2019m mommies favorite so imma play into it and be cute and sad\u201d it\u2019s annoying. that\u2019s exactly what he did/is doing. everyone else sees through it except for mom. that also tells you she\u2019s blinded by him cause he\u2019s her baby boy. OP is not TA. he\u2019s old enough to know right from wrong stop acting like an 11yo is a toddler that knows nothing",

      "content": "I actually feel sorry for your little brother.  As the youngest your mum spoiled him to the point where he has become such a brat that his older siblings ostracise him.  He senses this estrangement and subconsciously is desperate to be included and loved by them, but being only eleven has no idea how to bridge the gulf between him and his siblings.  Instead he acts out to get attention and communicates the only way he knows how and this toxic behaviour is enabled by his mum.  Ironically, this worsens the relationship with his siblings, it\u2019s a vicious cycle and he\u2019s too young to break out of it.\n\nESH.  Mainly your mum for spoiling your brother and your dad because it takes two to parent.  It's wonderful that your dad treasures you, but does he have an equally good relationship with your little bro?   Yes, you\u2019re an asshole for what you said, but deep down your little brother knows his siblings feel that way about him.  He uses negative emotions to express his feelings and get your attention.  Your negative attention is better than no attention.\n\nWhen I was 15 I was acquainted with a little 9 year old boy who I disliked and the feeling was mutual.  He was a little bit of a brat, but one day I realised that he was just a kid and didn\u2019t have the power to change our relationship dynamic, but being 15 I did.  I used positive reinforcement, hung out with him when he visited, joked around and talked about things he liked.  We turned that relationship around.  It\u2019s not your responsibility, but if you want to change your relationship with your little bro give him some positive attention and praise him when he does well.  It will work if your mum doesn\u2019t undermine your efforts by spoiling your brother.\n\nEdit:  $500 dollar perfumes, your dad calls you his princess and you haven\u2019t made any replies.  I just got trolled hard.",

Sure, it's possible his siblings are scapegoating him. But it's unlikely; sibling dynamics don't usually work that way unless parents are encouraging it. What's far more likely is that he's his mother's golden child and she spoils him and he acts out. So the siblings dislike him and he acts out more and it becomes a vicious circle.\n\nI don't think OP is TA, I think the parents are.",
