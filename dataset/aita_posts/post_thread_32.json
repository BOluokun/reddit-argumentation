  "post content": "I started seeing a guy roughly a year and a half ago. He has a 9yo (almost 10) daughter named \"Chrissy\". I have an 11yo son as well. We met each other's kids 3 months back and last month they started having weekend visits here. It's been a super hard adjustment for me especially. The kids get along for the most part but I'm just having a really hard time. My son has always been a fairly good kid and hardly ever given me issues. He never drew on walls or broke anything of importance or talked back (aside from occasionally, obviously, no kid is perfect) and he was always super quick to ask permission to touch my stuff. I personally think I lucked out and I knew that not all kids were as well behaved as my child but I wasn't ready, I don't think. I'm just overwhelmed. \n\nSo, since she has been doing weekend visits here (she stays in my guest room) she has destroyed a lot. Rips holes in the mattress and then says they were already there (they weren't), draws on the walls and windowsill with make up and marker, she even takes my new feminine pads to her room and will cut them up. She has put a hole in my wall and said it was already there. I can buy a brand new thing of shampoo and conditioner and it's 100% gone and in the trash by the end of her shower, which lasts 45 minutes every single time. She stomps her feet and slams doors when we have to speak to her and knocks things off the walls. She is generally a good kid but she is so fucking destructive. \n\nWhat really set me off was her coming here this weekend with her dad (my son was at his father's) and I was called in to the office to do a signing which would only take roughly an hour max. So I left them here without me. Well, when I got back she was sitting at the kitchen table with all my photo albums laying in front of her, cutting out the faces and everything else on these photos and gluing them to her \"scrapbook\". Photos that I cannot get back, as they were printed out YEARS ago when I was in foster care and those were the only copies I had. Photos of my dead friend as well. I went to my BF, who was on the phone outdoors and told him they needed to leave, explained the situation and told him I was fucking done. Those photos, as stupid as it may be, were a huge part of my childhood and now they are destroyed. I told him I was done speaking to him about his daughter destroying my shit and it was time to go. He thinks I'm an AH for throwing a year and a half down the drain over some pictures. Am I?",

They're absolutely going to mimic behavior that they favor, but children are just as capable of acting in spite of their upbringing than in accordance with it. Who they choose to become is absolutely informed by the parents actions, but the individual behaviors that result can definitely be a mixed bag.\n\nOur kid is 10, and I am near certain that he has a diagnosis for narcissistic personality disorder or similar looming in his future. His refusal of humility and self accountability are not traits from his mother, and they're not from my example. It is possible that this is hereditary from his bio-father, but I don't have enough info to draw conclusions there. \n\nI cannot begin to explain the time and mental effort that has gone into trying to guide him towards empathy and honest introspection, to get him to acknowledge how he impacts those around him. \n\nHis behavior is driven by these traits. Traits that are not otherwise displayed in the home or extended support structure. There have been numerous times where trying to combat these traits has proven counter-productive. Learning how to effectively correct and guide him has been far from straight-forward. \n\nThe point is, the behavior is counter to our example. It's counter to what we find acceptable, and we don't condone or excuse the poor behavior. He acts as he does in spite of our efforts and guidance. We're learning and adapting, trying new things (some work, some don't) and doing our best not to repeat our mistakes.\n\nIt's easy to dismiss children as being little more than mimics. There is a stage in their life when that description is accurate. But they're also a unique person, and have their own motives and desires as such. It's not as simple as 'parent does/is x, child does/is x'. Sometimes they meet humility with arrogance, sometimes they respond to honesty with dishonesty, sometimes they manipulate those interacting in good faith. And the opposite of all those are true as well. I've met some great people that came from a really horrible family.\n\nOverall, I would encourage you to judge a parent by how they respond to their children's poor behavior rather than by the behavior itself. Even a pattern of behavior may involve parents who are genuinely trying to find an effective approach but struggling.\n\nAs for OPs situation, from what little info she's given it doesn't seem like the girls father is attending to the behavior with any seriousness. Repeatedly approaching the issue in a way that has proven ineffective isn't much of an attempt at correction, it's just trying to smooth over the moment.",
