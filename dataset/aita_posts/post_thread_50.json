  "post content": "My daughters (11/10) both have purple hair. They love it this way and have been getting it dyed since they were 6 (with caution). They were invited to a little girl's birthday/Halloween party under the condition they have their hair dyed a natural color. I asked why and the mother insisted their hair would take away from birthday pictures cause they'd draw attention. I asked if my daughters could just not be in the pictures and she said there's no way to guarantee that and to either dye their hair a \"normal\" color or they can't come. I said fine (this was like October 8th maybe the 9th) so I decided to throw a party for my daughters on Halloween since they won't be able to go to that one and invited her classmates (the girl was in a completely separate class). We had the party; cake, bounce house, candy pi\u00f1ata and all that cool jazz. The girls had a blast and I posted a few pictures online.\n\nApparently this was the wrong move cause the little girl's mother saw my post and asked what right I had to steal her daughter's moment from her. Her daughter saw the pictures and was upset she didn't get to come to the party because they didn't have the things we did. Her mother said I was an asshole for one upping her just because my kids couldn't come to their party and that if I really wanted them there I would've just dyed their hair. AITA?\n\nINFO:The invite was on the 8th as was the hair dye request. A week after we RSVPed in the negative. I planned a Halloween party on the same day , October 31st / Halloween.  I did not throw a party on some obscure day that happened to be her birthday for the giggles and the pettys, it was a Halloween party on Halloween.\n\nINFO PT2: That lady is in a completely different tax bracket than me. She had a pony, assorted teas catered and a wagon ride as well. The party I threw was a Frankenstein bounce house my husband had from a few Halloweens ago, a few pi\u00f1atas from party city and like $120 of candy and about $100 in snacks and some basic carnival games (corn hole,balloon darts, sack race). -for those who where wondering what the difference between the parties were-",

Or that other guests wouldn't? Was there specifications for other guests as well? What real difference would it make real versus wig?\n\n**Imo I feel like OPs daughters were singled out**, at the very least for their hair colour choice, possibly for the tax bracket difference on top of the hair 'issue'. Possibly worried about them being a 'Bad influence' just because of their hair?\n\n*(also ngl a pony and tea assortment doesn't sound like a halloween party, unless its like some British Victorian vampire stuff, and I feel like the mom may have chosen more of the things with the party than the girl...)*\n\nEdit: u/Kylynara pointed out in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/qlf77y/comment/hj3ykc5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) a very good interpretation of the scenario that kind of did make me think this is ESH territory (I said why in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/qlf77y/comment/hj42p1w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and I am too lazy to retype stuff)",

Depending on the purple dye used and their natural color, OP\u2019s girls are probably using a direct pigment dye (very common for fantasy colors,) and may not even need to bleach it first if they have light hair. (That\u2019s how I dye my gray hair pink and purple.) But stripping out the purple and putting a \u201cnatural\u201d color over it is a damaging process, and may mean that re-doing the purple would become more difficult, not take the same, and damage their hair. Changing color without damage is a long process of gradually fading the original color until you can cover it with another. (Which is why I stick with pink/purple. If I tried to go green, it would just turn muddy unless I gave it several months for the pink to completely fade, being just gray in the meantime, or worked through the color wheel of pink, purple, blue, then green over six months or so.)",
