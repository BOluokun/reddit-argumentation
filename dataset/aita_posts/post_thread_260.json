  "post content": "throwaway for privacy.\n\n\n\nMy wife (23) and I (27) are expexting. She's due this month and things have been bit intense recently with her being extra hormonal.\n\n\nWe live in different state then my family. My wife and I couldn't visit for Christmas. my parents were calling to continue complaining about us not spending Christmas with them and demanded I make it up for them. I said I was open for any suggestions they had and they suggested they come stay with us for a week once the baby is born. That way they could spend time with us and the baby as well. I thought why not that seemed to be a pretty good suggestion since it's been months since we've seen each others so I told them to go ahead and made the invitation Official. This morning my wife was talking about her plans once the baby is here and that's when I remembered my conversation with my parents. I immediately told her that I agreed to let them over for a week once the baby is born to make up for the holiday we missed with them. She first looked shocked then freaked out at me saying I shouldn't have invited them just like that without talking to her first. I asked why not since she loves them and loves being around them but she explained that my family can be a lot of work and having them as guests while caretaking for a newborn is the last thing she wanted. I told her it was no big deal besides that we could use help if she thought about this way but she lashed out on me about how the first few days of the baby's life is essential time for bonding and being intimate and I just took that away from her by inviting my parents and invading her space. I argued that she was being melodramatic right then because my family are decent people and I'm pretty sure they'll make this experience a lot more warmer but she still disagreed and said if my family were decent then they wouldn't have accepted my invitation but I clarified to her that I did NOT invitem and this was in fact a suggested made by them and I just agreed AFTER they complained about me missing spending the holidays with them. She went off on me demanding I call them and cancel everything I planned with them but I thought that was unacceptable since she gave not a good-enough reason for me to do that and besides my parents can help but she still denied that being true.\n\nShe's gone radio silence for the rest of the day and is acting like my family are somehow making her uncomfortable though they're not the judgemental or intrusive type and are just about spending time with each others. AITA?\n\n\nHold on! #Edit few things so there's no misunderstanding here. Alright?\n\nFirst of all my wife doesn't normally have an issue with my family being around, they all get along pretty good. and second of all which is an important info my wife and I talked about having her directly speak to them about why she would rather postpone their visit so we could clear the air but she refused and said she doesn't want to ruin her relationship with them and asked me to do it (tell them not to come) but since my family are upset with me then me telling them not to come might be taken in an offensive way, you know what I'm saying? so it really feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nalso, to all the people saying that my wife shouldn't be hosting guests. I don't recall mentioning this nor expecting her to do anything for the family. matter of fact I really thought we could maybe use their help especially my mom.",

There is a good chance she will have been torn or cut. There is a good chance she won't be able to sit down. She will potentially be in a diaper and have walnut size clots of blood coming out of her body. There is a chance that the bathroom will not be guest ready after she has been in there because it will look like a abattoir are you cleaning up every time she goes in there.\n\nHer milk will come in on about Day 5 which is often extremely painful causes a huge hormonal surge and causes the milk blues. Her nipples will not yet have hardened up and might crack and bleed.\n\nYour baby may be an angel but then again it may not you wife might be feeding very very frequently meaning she won't sleep she will be exhausted look like shit and cry a lot\n\nYou think none of this is a good reason to not want to host guests.\n\nIn short the only people who should be staying with you are people who have seen her naked and could actually help her in the bathroom like her mother sister or husband.\n\nEdit.

It's not up to me to decide whether my partner's reason for not wanting my friend from out of town to live with us for a solid week is \"good enough\". \"I'm not okay with that\" is literally the only reason they need to give. It's their home.\n\nThe fact that OP's wife will have just GIVEN BIRTH just makes this a thousand times more appalling. OP is clearly completely clueless about what his wife is about to go through, from labour through delivery and the weeks to follow, caring for a newborn while recovering from an ordeal so arduous that it'll alter her body *permanently*. I feel so bad for her, knowing that she'll also have to deal with OP whinging in the midst of all this.\n\nOP, YTA. You literally couldn't be MORE of an AH, in this situation. I really, truly hope the responses to this post are the wakeup call you so sorely need. Your wife is going to need to be able to depend on you for support and care, both physically and mentally, and it really does not sound like you're up to the task, at this point, if you think right after childbirth is the time to have houseguests for a solid week.\n\nI also don't buy that your family will be there to help your wife. They tantrumed because the two of you were unable to travel interstate when she's heavily pregnant and demanded that you both make it up to them. They're clearly being selfish and entitled, and your wife's needs and wellbeing are not a priority to them. That's not even debatable, at this point.\n\nI genuinely hope you take this as your cue to step up and support your wife in whatever way she tells you she needs. You have absolutely no right to question her on that, right now.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the awards! I truly appreciate your generosity \ud83d\udc9c",

Granted, the MIL is expected to actually help and not expect to be entertained.

My mom is still grateful to this day and even after divorcing my father visits her regularly.

Talk to your parents and importantly (do NOT blame wife), but tell them that in second thoughts right after birth is NOT a good time. And you'll have them over some time later once you all think is best. You can tell them you're looking forward for them to meet her/him and will video chat before their visit.\n3. Get some peace offering for wife like a breakfast in bed, or some flowers\n\nCongratulations on your baby and best wishes to mum and child!\n\n\\[Edit: 7-... thanks to brilliant comments below\n\n1. There are many other helpful comments, OP be sure to read all the ways you are wrong here below\n2. I'll stop editing as the post is getting kind of long. But Many thanks for helping compile this list. I HAD to add No. 14 from u/BigMamaMB which is another great point.\n3. Part of me hopes that OP is not editing, as he's busy getting the flowers, and brunch ready, and practicing his apology in the mirror. But I would bet against myself here, as I think he carries the same entitlement as his parents\n4. Finally, MANY thanks for **ALL** the awards. Some **VERY** kind Redditors bestowed me with things I didn't know existed. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00 Very thankful!\\]",

Not to mention the two of you learning to be parents.\n\nPlus well done on showing to your wife that at her most vulnerable you will not be putting her first.",

First, guests are a *lot* of work and you don't just invite people to come stay, and especially not for a week or longer, without consulting with your partner.\n\nSecond, giving birth is a brutal experience. Many women simply want to be alone with their spouse and adjust and bond with their new child afterwards. They don't want to feel obligated to entertain, cook, and clean for their guests.\n\nThird, she doesn't want to have to fight for time with her new child.

END OF CONVERSATION. no further explanations and for the love of everything, DO NOT place the blame on your wife when talking to your parents. do not say it's because of your wife. end it there. if you want to be an equal partner worthy of respect, then do not throw her under the bus for YOUR mistake. again, it doesn't matter how much she loves them or they love her, stop it, do not force this on her. if she spirals down into post partum depression, anxiety, or medical complications, I would squarely put the blame on YOU and the stress, anxiety and situation you put her in.",

No.    OP doesn\u2019t even realize that having people staying in your house is WORK for the woman.",

My nephew is 2, and brother and SIL also have 2 very energetic dogs.  So, when mom went to stay (invited by both) for 2 weeks, her main focus was cleaning the house, doing any laundry, cooking some, entertaining the very energetic toddler because his mom was essentially on bed rest.  And in the evenings when he was asleep, unless mom was invited up, she just went and occupied herself with her own stuff in the guest space in the basement so my brother and SIL could just utterly relax.  So there was a very clear delineation that her visit was to help out and make life as easy as possible for my SIL, not to socialize and visit.  Without that sort of understanding, it\u2019d be a nightmare",
