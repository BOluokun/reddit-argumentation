  "post content": "\n\n**situation**\n\n\nI (M34) recently bought a one-story house. Note that it was purchased solely by me, my wife did not help save for it (I started saving for it before I even met here) and it's in my name.\n\n\nWhen my parents threw us a party for this happy ocassion, mom asked for a copy of the key in case of an emergency. I let her have it which made my wife upset. She didn't say anything at the time but she waited til we were alone and started arguing with me saying I shouldn't have let my mother have a copy of the key. I said \"why?!\" Since my mother is known to respect privacy and is a very trusted member in the family. She said that she does not feel \"comfortable\" with the idea of someone else, who's not a resident to have a copy of the key. She also brought up how my mother didn't pay a penny towards the house so this should \"disqualify her\" from getting the key. I said it was not a big deal but she kept presisting saying I need to take the key back. Quite frankly, this had me fuming. I pointed out that I'm the one who bought the house and it's my decision to decide who gets to have a copy of the key end of story. She screamed at me saying that \"technically\" she did contribute towards the house savings back when she used to pay for our rent and daily expenses while I saved money. I told her that she was acting as if I put my mom's name on the title which's ridiculous but she said that I have no respect for her opiniins and keep undermining her input.\n\n\nWe've been going back and forth on it since then. She's now \"letting me know\" that if I don't take the key back then she'll do it herself. I think she's being irrational and unreasonable acting like that over a copy of the house key. This decision I made could save us in case of an emergency but she kept downplaying it.\n\n\nE.T.A I think it's crucial to mention that there's no conflict between my mother and my wife. They're on near perfect terms, alright? I thought that I've already established that above.",

How long was she paying rent and how much did he have in savings before she started doing that? What was the actual agreement there? \n\nAnd on that note, why is the wife not making a bigger deal out of not having her name on the house? Did she agree to it for some reason that benefits her? Is this actually a bigger deal to her than OP is letting on and that\u2019s why she\u2019s so resistant to the idea of his mom getting a key? Does he pull the \u201cit\u2019s my house\u201d thing often?\n\nIt feels like OP left out a huge chunk of the story here.",

He would get a job and then quit for reasons like working as a grocery store clerk was beneath him. He played a lot of video games with his best friend and then at some point went to school at night for training to be an EMT although that lasted just a few months. He passed his exam and then still didn\u2019t get a job. Fast forward 5 or so years and we decided to purchase a home, but his credit was horrible from before we met, so the only way the loan would go through is if he wasn\u2019t on it. He had finally had a job he liked and was working consistently for a couple years. I was miserable at my job and had a long commute so we discussed it and he said I should quit and find a new job. I quit and was job free for a couple months while I job hunted. Anyway 2 years later, we separated and started going through our divorce process and he kept referring to the time I didn\u2019t work and saying how he should get the house because he paid for everything and his parents gifted us 2k towards the down payment. I wanted to sell and split it 50/50. He got cruel and hurtful and it went to court. The judge didn\u2019t see it his way and I got 100% of the house. Oddly enough his parents and I are still close. I take it as a testament that my ex is an AH. His dad texted me the other day to tell me they were thinking about me and hope I was well because I deserve happiness. I have a feeling things will work out for ops wife in the long run.\n\nEdit: typo",
