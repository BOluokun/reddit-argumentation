  "post content": "\n\nMy wedding was days ago. My brother attended but his wife didn't. She was nearing her due date to give birth and she didn't come. The wedding was going well. Til my brother recieved a call from his mil telling him that sil was in labor. He told me he was leaving and my wife and I were fine with that but the issue began after he had told one of the guests that sil was in labor. Word spread out and suddenly, everybody was talking about it which disrupted the event. Even my parents started calling and there was a huge fuss which frankly, was unnecessary if my brother just left in silence or made up some excuse.\n\nI contacted him later and expressed my grief and frustration with what he did. I told him how the news of his wife being in labor disrupted the wedding and caused my wife to feel like her day was ruined. He lashed out asking how any of that was his fault. I explained how he should've just left or made up some excuse to leave but he said he didn't mean any harm and that he was in a hurry and worried at the time. He said it wasn't like he announced it and told me I disrespected him by arguing with him about it. We had a big argument and our parents sided with him and told me to 'get over myself' and are now expecting me to apologize.\n\n\nEdit// I just came back and started reading the comments. First comment I appreciate the sarcasm but in all seriousness, I did not expect people to come against me in this matter. I do accept my judgement but still am taken aback a little.",

I can\u2019t believe he did that, it totally ruined our day. Your brother has to be the center of attention always. No one in your family can be happy for us. \n\nGuys do this and Women do it too, usually in controlling relationships they start build anger between you and your family. Then you slowly drift away from your family. You stop going to your family events, stop inviting your family by, and you loose touch with your family. Then it\u2019s all about her family, you do everything with her family, all that matters is her family.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen it happen to so many family and friends.

I encouraged people to wear whatever was comfortable, even the bridal party. We had plenty of parking and paid for people to get transportation. We asked around for food restrictions. We had the photographer take some nice family photos for all of my husband\u2019s siblings and children. And honestly, if I did it again, I would make it even less formal and more fun.

Guests will be pregnant. If it\u2019s noticeable, they have no choice but to be openly pregnant and accept any congratulations they receive. Guests may be recently engaged, or new homeowners, or new parents, or newly graduated or promoted, and there\u2019s no reason they shouldn\u2019t talk about those things! That\u2019s just what humans do in social situations, and anyone who doesn\u2019t want that should invite a room full of mannequins instead of human guests. It would also save on catering costs.",
