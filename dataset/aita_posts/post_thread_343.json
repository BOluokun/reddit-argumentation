  "post content": "I'll preface this by saying that my husband (Luke) M32 does not get along with my parents. You can't tell who's right or who's wrong, there's always this ongoing tension between them but can be civil enough to sit together at one table.\n\n\nI recently got an invitation for christmas celebration from my parents. The invitation including me and Luke but Luke thought this was somewhat rude and a disrespectful because he believes he should get his own invitation and not have his name mentioned as an \"extention\" to mine. We talked and he said he wouldn't go unless they send him a proper invitation. I called mom and asked if she could do it. She thought it was ridiculous and said that she and dad did the same with my sister and her husband. I told her it was fine but Luke can be sensitive like that and so a simple invitation in a form of a text directly to him will fix it. She got defensive and said that Luke is being ridiculous. Dad claimed that Luke is trying to pull some power move to humiliate them but I thought this was a small issue. They still thought it was ridiculous so I told them I won't attend if they don't send him a separate invitation because he won't attend if he doesn't get it. This blew up and my sister started arguing saying Luke needs to get over himself and shamed me for trying to \"force\" our parents to send him an invitation by saying I won't come if they don't.\n\n\nWe haven't talked after that and we're waiting as of now.\n\n\nedit! The invitation I recieved was in a text. Luke is saying that a simple text to him will finish the conflict but my parents still think it's ridiculous and that they won't invite him since they already have.\n\n\n**UPDATE! I just got off the phone with my sister. She told me our parents have just disinvited me (Luke was probably already disinvited since the argument occured) from the celebration. I feel horrible but I can't argue anymore, just like I can't argue about what everybody else in the comments is saying. I admit it! Luke is the problem. He just caused me to be disinvited from the event and is blaming ME for it.**",

Your mom called and said \"I hope you guys can come for Christmas\" or \"We're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas\", that is the Royal You, not just you OP.\n\n**Question**: If a friend issued the same invitation as your mom did, would Luke be kicking up a fuss, or would he just go?\n\nThis isn't about the invitation. Luke just doesn't want to go. Your choice is to stay with him, or go without him, but your parents don't have to issue Lukie Wubbie his own special private invitation. And think hard - is this really the only time he kicks up a fuss, or do you tiptoe around a LOT of things. Be honest.",

If they do send the text then he wins and still shows how much control he has over them all because he got his way in the end.
