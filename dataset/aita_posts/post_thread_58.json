  "post content": "Hi everyone, \n\nUpdate: from what everyone has said I am clearly NTA. Thank you all for your concern and well wishes. Ana and her family have been blocked and I will no longer be in contact with her. \n\nIt was also brought up to me by another user that their was a similar post posted a few weeks ago from a hosts perspective. This is NOT the same post. My situation happened really recently (allot more recent than whatever the previous post was) I\u2019m shocked to hear this has happened befor, but yeah it\u2019s \ud83d\udcaf not related to ours haha\n\n\nFinally I\u2019ve had a few comments about my dog being \u201ccertified\u201d that I want to clarify. I am not from the US so I\u2019m unsure what your guys process is like, but all I mean is that Bailey has gone through the required testing, training and registration to ensure she is legally aloud to be classified as a service animal :) \n\n\nI just want to start by saying I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not the A-hole. But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I\u2019m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I\u2019m not crazy.\n\nI (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age\u2026 but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me. \n\nI have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let\u2019s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn\u2019t come to restaurants, I\u2019m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn\u2019t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It\u2019s not just for show.\n\nMy seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My \u201csmall ones\u201d are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I\u2019m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don\u2019t know me wouldn\u2019t even connect this. My \u201cbig ones\u201d are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it\u2019s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities. \n\nAnyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can\u2019t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn\u2019t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I\u2019ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her \u201ccompromise\u201d was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.\n\nI was an idiot and said fine because I didn\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends. \n\nI ended up having a seizure, blacking out and smashing my head on the floor. I had to go to the hospital because of how hard I hit my head. \n\nI guess my friend group absolutely handed Ana her ass calling her hateful, toxic, and a jealous witch. I guess she was trying to say that I passed out for the attention and I got my way like always. Long story short no one wants her around anymore.\n\nSince this happened her, her sister and mom have been blowing up my phone, calling me the ass hole and demanding I fix this situation and it\u2019s honestly getting to me.. so Reddit. AITA?",

I really hope you are OK after the seizure and also hitting your head.\n\nI have to commend your willingness to compromise that you'd risk getting hurt, and then actually getting hurt. I know it's not intentional but it sure got your point across.\n\nIf your \"friend\" was a normal person she would have apologized after the incident, but she doubled down and said you did it essentially on purpose. I think this is where she lost everyone.\n\nTBH, this is the least AH story I've read on the OP. Obviously the AH is this Anna",

If he'd been willing to listen to me maybe I wouldn't have been annoyed, but each time felt like I was talking to a wall and it wore me down immensely, especially because anything I said to calm him down was immediately shot down with \"You're my friend, you're just saying this to cheer me up\".\n\nOn top of that, I did not feel like he could be there for me when I needed it: if I had a breakdown, he would either try to make me smile ignoring the events (like, dance around in a silly way to make me giggle) or he'd downplay my worries, and neither helped. This is not counting all the times he said that seeing me cry was making him ache with helplessness, to the point he'd start crying too and blame himself so the cycle repeated: I would have to stop thinking about my issue and console him about his, mine always ending unresolved.
