  "post content": "I grew up in a single-parent household with my mother and my half sister \"Kacey\" who is 7 years younger than me. My mother struggled with drug abuse for the majority of her life, and as a result I have no clue who my father is. Kacey's father was also heavily into drugs and only stuck around for 3 years. I basically raised Kacey because when my mom wasn't at work, she was either gone for days on end or holed up in her bedroom/the bathroom doing drugs with whoever her boyfriend was at the time.\n\nI am now 31 and have no desire to have children after spending much of my youth caring for Kacey. Kacey unfortunately followed in my mother's footsteps in that she began excessively drinking, smoking, partying, etc. She enrolled in a university that's known for being a party school but dropped out during her first year after getting pregnant with my niece. 14 weeks into Kacey's pregnancy we learned that the baby would likely be born with intellectual and physical disabilities. I am pro-choice and discussed abortion as an option with Kacey, who at the time refused and assured me that she would love her baby no matter what disabilities she was born with.\n\nMy niece is now 4 years old and is nonverbal with pretty severe cognitive delays and motor/sensory issues. My mother has been sober for about 5 years and has since come around to help out Kacey with my niece. She feels bad about our poor upbringing and as a result enables Kacey to continue partying and being an irresponsible parent. Kacey is hardly ever around while my mother is left alone with my niece. She's pretty much become my niece's 24/7 caretaker. Both my mom and sister have asked that I help babysit from time to time, but I\u2019ve politely declined because I know nothing about caring for special needs children. I also work a lot so I don't see how they think I would be able to do this. \n\nRecently I learned that my mother is planning to move a few states away as her boyfriend would like to be closer to his family. Meaning, she will no longer be around to help take care of my niece. Now Kacey has asked that I become my niece's godmother and that I move back to our hometown and in with her to help out. I declined because I know that what she really means is that she would like *me* to become my niece's primary caretaker. She then asked to \"compromise\" by having me pay for a home care aid, and for assisted living for when my niece turns 18. Again, I refused. My husband and I both have well-paying jobs so technically we could afford it, but I am sick of everyone rewarding Kacey for her poor choices. This resulted in a screaming match between her and I where, in the heat of the moment, I told Kacey that she should have gotten an abortion if she knew she was unwilling to step up and be a mother to a child with special needs. Now I am receiving daily texts from both her *and*  my mother stating how terrible of a person I am, and that if I truly cared about our family that I would help out. Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: I do plan on calling CPS. The only reason I haven\u2019t done so is because my mother has actually taken very good care of my niece. My mother\u2019s boyfriend is also very experienced with caring for special needs children due to the nature of his job.",

This is an extreme example, obviously, but if everyone adopts the mindset that CPS is useless, they won't call them for cases of extreme abuse or neglect, then children will die.\n\nI am not an SW, but I have several friends that are.  The child would most likely not be removed in this situation, but they could always create an action plan with the mother if necessary.  If this were to happen, she would be required to follow certain steps (like counseling, for example), and they would be able to ensure these steps are being completed.  Even if they do nothing right now, though, the situation should be documented, so if they were called again about the family in the future, they would have more information to better respond to the situation.",
