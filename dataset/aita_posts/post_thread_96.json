My ex's new gf, whom he's only been dating for 9 months, just found out I never went back to using my maiden name. I kept my married name. In part so I would have the same last name as my kids but also because my maiden name was a little embarrassing. She asked me when I planned to change it. I told her I do not plan on changing it back ever. She has convinced her family and my ex in laws that I am only keeping the name to spite her and my Ex. My ex sister in law has even called me the A-hole for \"keeping a name that isn't mine\" My ex says he doesn't care one way or the other. so am I the A-hole?",

So, we can either go through the legal chanels to change their last name to mine, which will be a pain in the neck legally as well as confusing to them, or we can all take a step back and realize that this whole discussion is crazy and that I have a valid reason for wanting the same legal last name as my children.\"\n\nThat said, OP, your Ex is foolish for not shutting this down. I'd broach THIS subject with him. The fact that he needs to shut her down because you both know that there is a valid legal reason pertaining to your children's health and wellbeing that you are retaining your married name.
