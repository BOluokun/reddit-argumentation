  "post content": "My cousin turned 18 recently. She\u2019s in high school. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a car, and during her birthday weekend, thought her parents were going to buy her one. They didn\u2019t get her one and she was pretty upset. I should note that I\u2019m not very close with my cousin. Or the rest of my extended family for that matter. I only heard about this through the grapevine from my dad. Anyway\n\nMy cousin texts me on the Friday before her birthday asking if she can take my car (I just leased a new Ford escape) to the mall and then for an out of town road trip with her friends over the weekend. I tell her no. \n\nShe begs and pleads with me. I tell her no again. My car is for me to drive and for me only. If she wants her own car she can save up and buy one. She calls me a bitch and says that I ruined her birthday and that she\u2019s embarrassed because her friends think she got a car for her birthday and she doesn\u2019t have one. I don\u2019t respond to her and think nothing of it. \n\nThe weekend comes and I sleep in very late on that Saturday, waking up at 1:00 pm (don\u2019t judge lol). Even though my car is parked in my driveway and my gate is closed, I come to realize that someone egged and TP\u2019d my car. With many, many eggs and 5-6 rolls of TP. And since the weather was warm outside, the raw egg baked into my car, along with the dried up toilet paper, destroying the paint. \n\nSince I have security cameras around my house, I decide to go back and watch. At around nine thirtyish that morning, I see my cousin and a bunch of her stupid friends vandalizing my car. I\u2019m surprise she didn\u2019t smash the windows and poke holes in the tires too.\n\nTo save my post from the 3000 character limit, I obviously pressed charges and my cousin is in legal trouble. Her and her parents are pissed off at me for pressing charges, her parents telling me that she\u2019s \u201cjust a kid\u201d and that she\u2019s been through a lot of \u2018emotional stress\u2019 doing virtual schooling for this past year and that I should take that into consideration, and that I should be ashamed of myself for pressing legal charges against my baby cousin, that I\u2019m almost 30 and dont I remember what I was like at that age? (I do remember, and I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to egg anyone\u2019s car) and can\u2019t she work something out with me like doing chores around my house for money if I drop the charges... that she\u2019s young, that she doesn\u2019t need a felony on her record, etc. and that it was just a prank. Right after I press charges, my cousin was calling and texting me over and over saying that this could\u2019ve been avoided had I let her take my car. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\nI need to add that my cousin already has a felony on her record, a DUI. She\u2019s not remorseful of anything.\n\nAlso, my aunt and uncle will not pay me for the damages. They just want me to drop the charges and pay for everything myself like nothing happened. They are cheap.",

That she would text you and basically retroactively threaten you to let her take the car or she\u2019d vandalize it says a lot about her character, and she\u2019d probably have charges pressed against her at some point in the future anyway. Hopefully she learns a lesson to avoid that happening again. Also, chores around the house to make up for it? It\u2019s called community service ordered by the judge.",
