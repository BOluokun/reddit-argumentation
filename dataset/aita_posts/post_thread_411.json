  "post content": "Last week, I was using my sister Ashley\u2019s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend\u2019s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she\u2019s on tinder (she\u2019s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said \u201cnone of your business\u201d \n\nI decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she\u2019s just swiping for fun?) so I didn\u2019t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he\u2019d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. \n\nI created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister\u2019s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she\u2019s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. \n\nI decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could \u201chead to my place afterwards\u201d. She was completely receptive and said she\u2019d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. \n\nAfter she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for \u201cJim\u201d. My dad went up to her and said \u201cJim\u2019s not coming\u201d and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger\u2019s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. \n\nI told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a \u201cfucking dick\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who\u2019s right and if I went too far?\n\nEDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would\u2019ve had sex with Jim. That\u2019s why I went the extent that I did.\n\nAlright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I\u2019m TA. But I\u2019m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder. \n\nAnd to the people who said she\u2019ll never speak to me again, we just finished playing fifa for the last hour so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

Suppose she stills meets/talks/eats with him, and doesn\u2019t walk away immediately. Then either they click or they don\u2019t . For all intents and purposes it carries the same risk of meeting someone on the internet who isn\u2019t lying about their identity. Anything that could happen with a catfisher can happen with someone who isn\u2019t lying about themselves on the internet. At worst, she\u2019s a little more suspicious of someone who catfished (which is a bad thing).\n\n\nWell what if they don\u2019t click? Typically the date ends there and they go one their separate ways. But we\u2019re doing worst case scenario, so let\u2019s assume he doesn\u2019t want the date end but she does. Suppose she gets some weird vibes and begins to feel uncomfortable. So she goes restroom to think. Maybe she tells another woman in the bathroom, or calls a friend, or goes up to the bar/maitre de/any random waiter(ess) and tells she feels uncomfortable and ask for help. Either way someone else is alerted to the scenario, and she goes home alone.\n\nOkay, but what if he grabs her? She screams/yells/fights and everyone in the restaurant is alerted. Basically the same scenario as above.\n\nWhat if he has a gun? And won\u2019t let her go to the restroom? Okay yeah, I\u2019ll give you that one. I can\u2019t see anyway out of a gun scenario. Guns are dangerous weapons. \n\nBut what if he spikes her drink? Okay, let\u2019s suppose she leaves her drink unattended and he slips something in.  The vast majority of date rate drugs are fast-acting, and people don\u2019t drink unattended drinks at the end of the date, so the date rate drugs would kick in before they leaves. I\u2019m going to assume she\u2019s wearing heels because it\u2019s a classy restaurant. Well date rape drugs make your disoriented and clumsy, so she\u2019s probably going to fall and slur her words. Of course, someone could just assume she\u2019s drunk, but she\u2019s 19 and hopefully hasn\u2019t had any alcohol and the waiter would notice. Or she might starting fighting/yelling or she could call 911. Or she could straight up pass out on the ground. \n\nIdeally, she would have a friend near by or tell the staff that she shouldn\u2019t leave with him unless she gives the okay. But she may not have known to do so, because this isn\u2019t common practice or at least I don\u2019t believe it is. \n\nBut what happens if they leave together and she changes her mind? The sad fact is when she\u2019s alone with a perpetrator, it becomes much harder to get out of a rape scenario. Of course, this is true regardless of how long they\u2019ve known each other and has nothing do with them being romantic. It could be a friend, a coworker, or a boss. \n\nIn 93% of juvenile rape cases are committed by someone known to the victim [Source](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/children-and-teens) . 8 of 10 rape cases, the victim knew the assaulter [Source](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf).  55% that occur at or around the victim\u2019s house vs 15% that occurred in some public place like the street or a park or in \u201cother\u201d locations [Source](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvsv9410.pdf).\n\nThe fact is if she is going to be raped, it\u2019s most likely going to be by someone she knows, not a stranger. The OP was TA and clearly wasn\u2019t acting in his sisters best interest.",

Hell, I have seen couples on there saying \"Happily married and not trying to do anything weird, we're just new to town and don't have any friends! Let's go on a hike!\"",

She\u2019s not going to trust you and will resent you for this. And if you were truly trying to teach her a lesson you would have sat her down and told her to wait a year or less when she turned 18.
