  "post content": "So to start this off  I\u2019m the only male in my house hold, my father passed away when I was younger, I live with my mom and my sister who is 16, I\u2019m 17. Being the only male in the house can be really unfair sometimes, I hate it.\n\nSo me and my friend, who is the same age as me had plans already, we were going to hang out with these two girls, But my sister wanted to go hangout with her stupid boyfriend. I told her no I wasn\u2019t going to take her because I\u2019ve already made plans to hang out with people and when I told  her that she starts getting an bitchy attitude, then she called our mom who was at work at the time, and told her I wouldn\u2019t take her to her boyfriend\u2019s house, and of course you know my mom yelled at me and demanded that I took her so I did. We went to pick up my friend first. \n\nI pick him up and we are on the way to drop my sister off. He lights a cigarette then out of no where my sister starts yelling and shit, \u201cPut that out, I have asthma!\u201d I told her to stop fucking yelling one cig won\u2019t hurt, she continued talking shit to me so I let the window down but she still was like \u201cThe window doesn\u2019t help! I want him to put it out now\u201d then I asked my friend to just put it out he refused to \u201cyou need to learn how to control your sister, you are the older brother dammit, no I\u2019m not putting it out\u201d Then out of no where my sister stars kicking the back of my seat like a fucking brat! I told her to stop she kept saying \u201cPut it out! Put it out!\u201d So I slammed on the brake and said get out of my car, she said \u201cNo I want it out now\u201d I told her it\u2019s my fucking car I can decide what happens in it, then she started to call our mom so, I got out the car and dragged her out and made her walk to rest of the way. \n\nWhen I got home later on that day, My mom raised so much hell, shit she even tried to take my car keys away from me, of course I didn\u2019t let that happen, its MY car I payed for it. My mom was saying shit like \u201cyou are a horrible brother! Why would you make you sister walk by her self! What if something happen to her?\u201d Well she needed to learn not to disrespect my car and my friends. Like I was saying in the beginning being only male in the house fucking sucks, I can\u2019t wait to leave the shithole.",

You're dropping her off anyways, he could have lit another one soon after. \n\nYour sister on the other hand sounds spoilt and childlike, demanding rides and calling your mother every time she's inconvenienced is hardly mature behaviour.\n\nThe biggest asshole here though, by far, is your friend. \"control your sister\"??? It's not a brother's job to control their sister. The fact that you didn't stand up for your sister and kicked HER out of the car instead of your asshole friend after he had the audacity to say that and smoke in front of her with no consideration of her asthma is just sad.",

Opening the window is definitely not enough at all and this was extremely inconsiderate and rude! Your friend can't go a few mins without smoking?",

You know your sister has asthma and you were going to let your friend smoke in the car. I\u2019d probably have the same reaction too. Also kicking her out and making her walk is a dick move. If my friend refused to put out the cigarette that affected MY SISTERS HEALTH he would be the one that got kicked out. I hope this is a troll but if not please seek some help because all this maliciousness you hold towards your family is not healthy.",

If she doesn't like it she can find other means of transport) not to mention kicking the back ofbthe drivers chair whilst the car was in motion. Putting everyone's lives in danger.\n\nHis friend because he was asked to put his cigarette out by OP and refused and told OP to control his sister. Added AH points because sister has got asthma so doubles down on the don't force others to inhale your second hand smoke.\n\nThe mum because she's enabling the bratty entitled behaviour of the sister. She should not have got involved but the fact that sister rang her as soon as OP said no and then Mum backed sister up in her unreasonable demands heavily suggests this is common behaviour.\n\nOP is still an AH but lesser than the others. He should have kicked his friend out of the car for refusing to put out his cigarette.\n\nEta: question baxk to you, why is no one else an AH?",

Who knows. But yes it is his car but he lives in his mother house the least he can do is drive his sister somewhere. Then the only reason why OP sister was causing a fit was because his friend lit a cigarette when his sister has asthma. Then and I quote he said \u201cone cig won\u2019t hurt\u201d knowing his sister has asthma and instead of telling his friend to put it out right away he tells his sister to stop bitching even though she literally would not be able to breathe. That\u2019s why she was kicking the seat. A childish reaction? Yes. But when you are worried about your breathing I think it\u2019s a bit justified. Then instead of kicking out the friend who refused to put out the cigarette he kicks his little sister out and makes her walk. So yeah compared to his mom and sister he\u2019s the asshole and so is his friend. They are lovely assholes together",
