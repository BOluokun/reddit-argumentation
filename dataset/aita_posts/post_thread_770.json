  "post content": "I'm not looking for relationship advice, I literally can't tell what's normal reactions due to a stunted emotional upbringing from my fam. \n\nSo the husband doesn't like going places by himself, wants me to come along. Normally I drive and he often makes small comments that I've learned to ignore. Today he drove. He was grumpy the whole time. I had a headache, so I'm sure I wasn't a peach either. \n\nHe decided against turning the one way because there where other cars there. So I said,\"oh you aren't going that way, ok.\" He decides to pull into a stores parking lot to drive to a road he wanted, even though there was a turn further up. I commented on that, because I honestly didn't fucking know if he knew that it was there. He says he didn't want to take it, he couldn't see up there. I hate cutting thru parking lots. We get home and I hear a loud crunch of my wheel run hitting the curb so I say, \"well that's nice\" and he freaks the fuck out. He slams my gear shift so hard it breaks the top. He proceeds to rip a broken light off the door on his way in telling me that I don't need to go with him if I'm going to be a bitch the whole time. That I don't need to ignore him for 12 hours (I have no idea what he's talking about today-i did work 14 hours yesterday) and then only interact with him by being a bitch .\n\nI told him I didn't want to go to fucking errands. He's the one who wants me to go fucking with him. Do we both suck? Or am I the asshole?",
