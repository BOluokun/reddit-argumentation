  "post content": "So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing. \n\nWhen I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. \n\nWe had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. \n\nTwo weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! \n\nI asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. \n\nMy wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a \"real\" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.\n\nLike I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?\n\nEdit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she\u2019s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She\u2019s always been awesome to me and she\u2019s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly\n\nedit2: are the \u201cmommy bailed you out\u201d comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it\u2019s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not paying for it on my own eventually.\n\nEdit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?\n\nEdit4: I\u2019m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I\u2019m still reading because honestly I\u2019m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another\n\nEdit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you\u2019re a mod, do you know? I can\u2019t respond to any posts and get the \u201cstatus 403\u201d whenever I try. Thanks!\n\nEdit in the morning: I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was getting so many private\u2019s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn\u2019t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I\u2019ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I \u201chad come to your senses\u201d I don\u2019t want to disappoint her. It\u2019s going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",

We can have a nice, tense scene where she's literally mulling over murdering him, but decides that she needs to be there for the baby and just leaves. Guy goes to move in with Mom, who gets upset when she sees how cavalierly he talks about/treats his 'inheritance' while she is still alive, sees how she has messed up raising him, and throws him out. He ends up sleeping in the Bronco, which gets totaled due to his bad driving. Trying to think a way to bring sister into this. Maybe she's a lesbian and ends up marrying the wife, after consoling her for her brother being such a prick, and they live happily ever after with the baby.  Mom tragically dies later because she can't afford her chemo, and doesn't tell anyone she needs treatment because she spent that money on the Bronco, so he ironically actually DOES kill a parent over the stupid truck.",

He traded in his paid off sedan, and got a loan for the remaining $50,000.  When I sat him down and took him through our finances, and showed him there was no way we could pay for it, he said he would take it back.  He didn\u2019t. He hid the car from both me and his family until the (I think) 5 day return policy had passed.  He refused to take responsibility for it,  he blamed me because apparently I should have somehow hunted him down and stopped him from buying it. This was before cell phone gps, and I still don\u2019t understand how he thinks I would have tracked him down.  I would NEVER have thought he was capable of being this person.  But over the next 3 years, the person I married was replaced by a selfish, controlling, irresponsible person.  We ended up having to sell the car, which lost tons of value, for 23,000.  Which meant we were down one car, and owed 27,000 on a loan with nothing to show for it.  I ended up having to go back to work less then 2 months after our daughter was born. \n\nI hope OP\u2019s wife is smarter than me and leaves him now instead of staying for 3 more years like I did.",

However, you could make great memories with your daughter with any car. This car is only important because it makes the memories better FOR YOU, meaning even your justification is selfish.\n\nOn top of that, ask yourself why you didn't pause for 30 seconds and call your wife to ask her about this purchase before you made it. Was it because you didn't even think about her because you were so focused on yourself? Was it because you didn't think her opinion mattered because this was SO important to you you didn't care what she thought? Was it because you had a sneaking suspicion she'd say no and wanted to ask for forgiveness instead of permission?\n\nI get that it was important to you, but $23K is a LOT to spend on something that is only important to you, and is just a slap in the face to those involved when it wasn't even your money to spend in the first place.",

If that car is more important to you than your child's education, your wife/her parents' trust, your credit score, your/your daughter's/your wife's financial security, you should divorce your wife, leave your child, and marry the car. You did not consult your wife and spent tens of thousands of dollars (the majority of which was communal savings for your daughter's college fund that was a gift from your in-laws) without so much as a phone call, yet you had plenty of time to contact your mother to help you in this hare brained scheme. This was irresponsible to an honestly cruel degree. College takes time to save up for, and the $12,000 could've sat and accrued some amazing intrest if you had stopped to think. Plus, this car is already pushing 50 years old. It's not worth that kind of money in my opinion- and even if it was, you've traded MAYBE five to ten more years of it running (with constant and expensive repairs) for your daughter's future and your relationship with your wife. That's a spectacularly bad deal to carry for the rest of your life for a few more years of reminiscing about your dad. I'm sorry you lost him so early, but I can't imagine any parent thinking this was a good idea- your mom included.
