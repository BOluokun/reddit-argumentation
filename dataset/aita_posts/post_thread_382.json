  "post content": "I am a makeup artist for the past 9 years. I charge $500 for bridal makeup, around 250 for bridesmaid etc makeup but for regular party makeup I charge around $150.\n\nSo few weeks ago a lady had booked me for a party makeup on June 25th. She booked at 10am. I went there thinking I'd do a regular party makeup. I had agreed $150 with her.\n\nAs I was there, there were some people coming over. I assume relatives. At some point it slips from a woman about the wedding and I realise the woman I'm doing the makeup on is the bride. I'm doing a bridal makeup charging for simple party makeup.\n\nI was completely pissed how she lied about the occasion but I kept doing my job. After we were finished. She gave me $150 and I notified her we are actually $350 short. She asked what I meant by that and I said that I did a bridal makeup. You're the bride. That's what I charge for bride's. She said we had agreed on a simpla party makeup and that I am basically ripping her off because I worked the same amount of time and used the same products as I'd use in a bridal makeup so the title of the event shouldn't matter. I told her she doesn't get to dictate how I form my prices. She then refused to pay me at all and called me a scammer and told me to get out. Before I left her mom threw $200 on my face and told me to get lost.\n\nI was telling what happened to my friends and they all sided with the bride and said that unless I used more expensive products and I did extra labor then I'm not justified in charging her more and since she requested party makeup I should just charge her that. AITA?",

You used the same products you would use on a simple party makeup and attempted to upcharge her $350 for what exactly? Just because she's the bride and you want to squeeze more money out of her? If you used different products or it took way longer then sure I could see the upcharge. But you didn't and it didn't so yes YTA.\n\nEdit: lots of likes. To those saying op did nothing wrong\nOp stated the only difference in the makeup is setting spray. Unless that spray was made by the gods themselves it is not worth the $350 upcharge.\n\nEdit 2: If anyone can justify why you would charge her more for no extras, other than a setting spray, when all she asked for was simple party makeup and didn't demand or ask for more than that, just because she is bride I'll eat my hat. Well my husband's hat cause I don't have any of my own.",

I also use wood as the base of the cake board instead of cardboard and will physically sketch out the design of the cake to show the couple before I start working on it so they can make adjustments if we're not on the same page.\n\nFor the cake itself, wedding cakes get best of the best fancy pants ingredients. Vanilla beans instead of extract, European butter, super high quality chocolate, local fresh fruit, etc. And everything gets extra care: cakes are leveled with a ruler instead of by eye, all of the fillings are measured out so they're *exactly* the same between layers, I'll literally use a level to make sure each tier is perfectly flat, things like that. \n\nAll that being said though, I explain all of this to the customers first and if they don't want all that stuff I'm fine charging the party price!

We have higher pricing for bridal makeup/hair for the following reasons:\n\n- Booking extra time as well as 100% dedicated service and attention, this covers extra product, time needed for hair extensions/hair pieces/falsh lashes/veils, etc. as well as understanding they may have to pause for photos, talking to the bridal party, etc.\n- A small portion of the additional fee is because of the extra stress that CAN be involved with anything surrounding a wedding\n\nWe QUOTE brides high to cover ourselves for the above reasons. If a bride only ends up getting something simple and straightforward then we charge less (except in the case where they specifically book the longer time then change their mind on the day of, we charge the higher price because they reserved the time meaning we turned away other services).\n\nAlso $500 is beyond insane. There is no way your time/materials are worth at least $250 an hour (allowing 2 full hours max for the makeup) I don't care where you are and what you are using. And if you were some sort of celebrity MUA then you would know how to properly book an appointment including contracts and deposits/prepayment to avoid this exact situation.\n\nEdited to add: OP put themselves into AH territory when they specifically waited until the end of the appointment to demand the extra money. If it was truly a concern she should have stopped when she realised it was a bride situation and communicated to the bride that since she was booked for a simple party makeup then that's all you can give her and that if she wants the more dedicated/in depth service then you will need to charge more. Then going forward she would use this as a learning situation for herself including a more in depth consult and perhaps a trial. THAT would have been the professional thing to do. Instead OP decided to be petty to prove a point.\n\nOP is definitely TA\n\n2nd edit to account for OP's own comments that solidify my judgement:\n\n- OP admits the client booked a party makeup and all she knew was the client's name, the service booked and the date/time. She did absolutely no follow up/confirmation, let alone a contract/deposit (contracts protect both parties and give realistic and solid expectations for everyone involved)\n\n- OP admits she uses the exact same products on both party and bridal makeup aside from specialised setting spray\n\n- OP gives the reason for the price difference as \"the responsibility\" yet does not give any explanation as to what extra responsible steps she takes to justify the pricing such as booking extra time, bringing extra products/lighting tools/keeping a backup MUA on standby in case of emergencies, etc. Repeatedly says \"its the principle\" which is, at best, vague AF.\n\n- OP agrees with and says she should have committed what amounts to assault by forcefully removing the brides makeup while at no point COMMUNICATING her frustration with the bride.\n\n- OP refuses to accept her judgement, saying the only reason she isn't taking the bride to small claims is because her friends would never let her hear the end of it.\n\nI'm glad OP has such amazing friends willing to be honest with her and make this the hill they die on. She should listen to them.",

Often hair stylists may feel they would have made more money with less hassle of packing up their tools and traveling to and from venues. However, no one is forcing those stylists to offer wedding hair services. Either you want to be available for wedding hair and all that it entails or you don\u2019t. It also covers the products we use and paying an assistant if needed. Sometimes brides are extremely particular and needy, that just comes with the occasion. I\u2019ve have lovely brides to work with and brides that made me reconsider if it is even worth my time and passion to do weddings anymore. That being said, the prices I\u2019m seeing these days are verging on the side of price gouging and taking advantage. \n\nI recently had a friend of a friend reach out to me and ask if I would be willing to do her hair (paid) for her wedding on site (a mile from where I live) because prices for just drying/shaping her natural curls and pinning a few pieces back were quoted to be around $500. I couldn\u2019t commit to the day, as I\u2019ll be out of town, but I told her I would be happy to do a run through with her at my house and teach her how to do her own hair if it came to it.
