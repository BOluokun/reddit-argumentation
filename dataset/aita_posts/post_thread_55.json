  "post content": "My sister has just given birth about a month and a half ago and I went over to help her with the baby/house chores since her husband couldn't take a leave from work. \n\nThe problem is, my sister is an extremely outgoing person and loves going to places/trying out new things.\n\nMe on the other hand, I'm burnt out and all I'm thinking about for an outing is how I will be carrying the stroller across the long metro stairs, the baby needing a diaper change and us running to the nearest toilet, the heavy traffic, the loud noises, in short I see it as stress and a chore, not something I'd do out of enjoyment.\n\nFor several days in a row now, I've been holed up in my room and refusing to go out with her while she goes alone. Today, she told me we will just go to the nearest park and that it's unhealthy for me to stay cooped up in the house all the time.\n\nI declined again and she became upset and said she wasn't in the mood to go out anymore. She said why I was even over if all I wanted to do was to stay home, that she was depressed and I'm making her feel worse. I told her she can always go by herself and leave the baby with me but she said that defeats the point of having company.\n\nShe grumbled about no one caring about her and went into their bedroom and shut the door. I've been thinking maybe I should've just suck it up and just go with her but I don't know why she insists on me going out too when I said I'm exhausted.\n\nIdk, AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I tried to knock and talk to her but she still won't talk to me so I wrote her a letter and slipped it underneath the door. I'm on my way to the hotel until my flight is up (we live in two different countries so sorry, the kind suggestions for coming once a week...etc are impossible. Once I'm gone I'm gone for a good while.)\n\nEdit to add info:\nI'm doing all household maintenance and cooking except for folding their laundry, cleaning up their bedroom, or grocery shopping as her husband takes care of these. \n\nSome nights when I hear the baby crying and none of them woke up I go feed him and put him back to sleep. During the day, we can both be in the house and I'd be the one changing him up sometimes. When she's out I watch him. When she needs to go to her doctor appointments I go with her and watch him outside. When we went out on outings before, I'd take care of the stroller and carrying the bags.",

It sounds like she's feeling lonely, perhaps isolated, she says she's depressed, and she feels like no one cares about her. This likely has little to do with OP or going on outings, and a lot to do with hormones and brain chemistry and might get significantly worse without diagnosis and treatment if it is indeed postpartum depression. OP, would you be willing to talk to your sister about these feelings and offer to accompany her to a doctor's appointment to see if they might be able to help your sister find relief?",
