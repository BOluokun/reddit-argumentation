  "post content": "I (26F) have an older brother (27M) who's been dating another guy (30M) for around 4 years. I don't have any issue with my brother being gay, but I have one with him wearing a wedding ring in order to pretend that he's married to him. You see, we live in a country where gay marriage still isn't allowed (Romania), but despite this, my brother and his boyfriend started wearing weddings rings recently. When I asked my brother about it, he told me that despite not being able to do it legally, they already consider themselves married spiritually and they're hoping that one day gay marriages will be allowed to do legally as well, either by leaving the country or waiting till gay marriages are made legal here as well. While I think this nice, I told him that they shouldn't be wearing wedding rings till they actually get officially married, as I think it's kind of distasteful. He told me that they're just a symbol of their love and that they're not hurting anyone by wearing them, but I disagreed, they're actively misleading people into thinking that they're actually married and frankly just making a mockery out of marriage. \n\nMy brother told me that he doesn't care what other people, including me, think about them wearing wedding rings and maybe they should just mind their own business, then left furiously. Not gonna lie, I think his comment here was kind of out of line, as all I did was to give my opinion on people wearing wedding rings when they're actually married yet and he seemed to take it personally. His boyfriend also contacted me later and told me that their romantic lives doesn't concern me and to stay out of it.\n\nAITA ?",

Well he was in the Army, we needed that bit of paper for our relationship to be acknowledged by our employers. I was 5 months pregnant looking ready to poo with at least twins, but when I asked for time off to help him, they said no. I went anyway, pointing out how ridiculous telling me that we didn't have a relationship... I had to be careful in his quarter as we weren't married yet so I shouldn't have been there. The MOD wouldn't have notified me had the accident been more serious.\n\n\nWe had a date in June booked, once he was mobile again we brought it forward & married 8 weeks later, with all the bells & whistles. When we changed our date there were leaflets about the then scheduled to start commitment ceremonies for same sex couples in the UK. I thought it wonderful until I read it..it was IMO insulting. It gave the legal rights but seemed like a OK you can have x, y  z but that's it you're not married just in a legally recognised committed relationship. That was just vile because that's what a marriage certificate gave me so splitting hairs was just ridiculous & unjustifiable, it was homophobic. Love is love & a committed relationship with a bit of paper to prove it is marriage. Every adult has the right to marry their significant other, it should be that simple. The love between my husband & I is the same as the love between his sister & her girlfriend. If they ever choose to make it official we'll be there to celebrate their wedding & love. Until then they're both my SIL & both our sons aunties. \n\n\nAs for OP saying brother & BIL wearing  rings is wrong or a mockery of marriage, the only wrong is that they cannot legally marry. Rings are a symbol of our vows they are not part of the legal part of getting or being married. Some married people don't wear rings, it doesn't make them less married. OP's brother & BIL are committed to a life long, exclusive relationship with each other & that's exactly what wedding rings symbolise. They absolutely should never wearing those rings & OP owes a huge apology & needs to accept them. Absolutely OP YTA, you need to make this right.",
