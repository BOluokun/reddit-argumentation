  "post content": "My (23f) parents have always told me I am welcome here and wouldn\u2019t have to worry about paying rent to live at home, as I should be saving up for my own home while I\u2019m here (up until a reasonable age of course.) \n\nRecently my mom has presented the idea of me paying rent because my parents are tight on bills, which I wholeheartedly understand but I do not agree with. I just got into a car accident, so I have no transportation and I\u2019m saving for a new car. And I\u2019m also going to finish school (which was interrupted due to covid.) I\u2019m also desperately trying to move out, because quite frankly, my house is disgusting. I do my fair share of cleaning, but it\u2019s beyond Dawn Powerwash. There\u2019s been a hole in my bathroom ceiling for the past 2 years because my dad tried to \u201cfix a leak\u201d (yes it is still leaking), we have a mouse problem, it smells like dog pee all the time, and I just don\u2019t want to pay rent to live someone where where the landlords can\u2019t fix anything, even if they are my parents. Everything in the house is grimy, cluttered, and my mom refuses to actually start throwing stuff away that she doesn\u2019t need. If I would have known they would start charging me this soon, I would have made my financial decisions much differently. But in my area, it\u2019s nearly impossible to afford a place without a roommate or making 3x the rent. The conversation with my mom wasn\u2019t heated, but I certainly did express my concerns. I don\u2019t want to feel like the freeloading child (which I am not when I\u2019m actively trying to get my life together and move out, but my brother (21m) has no plans or intentions on moving out) but i am not planning on staying here when I am financially in a place to leave. Am I in the wrong for thinking this way?\n\nEDIT: my parents are not poor. They will not lose the house or anything else. I pay ALL my own bills already. And they don\u2019t want me to HAVE to pay rent, and they are not kicking me out because of that.\n\nEDIT#2: this was a PROMISE, and includes not paying utilities, trash, etc because I was expected to be saving. They were especially promising of this BECAUSE i was going to school full time and knew I would need time to pay off student loans, find a job, etc. I would have never came home or went to a 4 year university had I not had this option. Also, my parents are bringing up struggling AFTER my dad doubled his salary, DIRECTLY after my accident and DIRECTLY after I mentioned I am going back to finish school. I am grateful for my parents, but a promise that I made my life plans around was broken, and the timing of this seems really off to me.",
