  "post content": "I love my roomate, I really do but some of her friends suck.\n\n\nI\u2019m a white bisexual and my whole life dealt with internalised homophobia and have seen my black friends deal with racism. My friend often has people over that use the word gay as an insult, they use the R word, and use all kinds of other slurs. She also has people over who are white and use the n word.\n\nIn the past one of her friends used gay in a negative way and I poured water on her, it was harmless \n\nYesterday one of her friends who was white said the N word, I asked him not to say it and he said he had a black friend he could call who gave him the pass. I asked him not to do it again, and said if he did I would pour water on him. \n\nMy roommate talked to me today and told me I wasn\u2019t allowed to pour water on her friends because it makes them uncomfortable, the thing is when they use those words it makes me uncomfortable and sometimes even hurts. I\u2019m afraid to have some of my friends who are black over because I don\u2019t want them to overhear people using those words and think badly of me. They have told me in the past they dislike hearing white people say the N word. \n\nMy roomate says since she plays rent she should be allowed to have people over and they can say what they want, but I told her I pay rent too and want to have a comfortable place I feel safe.\n\nI told her I am still going to pour water on people if they continue to use the words after I ask them not to. \n\nMy roomate says it is unrealistic and that they might let it slip, but I guess I don\u2019t understand, just don\u2019t say the words.\n\nAm I the Asshole\n\nEDIT: You guys are right, I need to grow up. I\u2019m going to look more into the history of some of these slurs so next time someone uses one I can explain to them why I think it is wrong with facts. I truly thank you for helping me see this.",
