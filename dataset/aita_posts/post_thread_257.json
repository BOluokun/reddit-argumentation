I'm probably what they would call a \"flexitarian\". \n\nMy son and husband always turn up their noses at tofu or any other meat alternatives - they say it's just \"weird\" that it's made to resemble real meat, so it's really the concept and not the taste. There are no allergies. My family and I often make two versions of dinner - one meat, one real, and twice the amount of pots and pans. There is an equal distribution of cleaning and cooking in this house, thankfully.\n\nMy daughters had a fun prank idea of making two pots of spaghetti sauce, under the pretense that one was meat (they were both the soy ground beef). The goal here was to see if their brother and father actually hated the meat and to see if we could maybe save some dishes and time (in the future).\n\nEveryone loved dinner, both husband and son finished their plates. This was when my youngest couldn't hold it in anymore and told them. They both got VERY upset about being fed something other than what they were told.\n\nReddit, AITA?",

In OP's particular case, I would think they would be aware of an allergy within the immediate family, so they got lucky this time.

If the person has an allergic reaction (which happens A LOT with tofu) you're going to jail and will likely be on the hook for all medical expenses. \n\nThere was actually a post on here while back asking if the poster was the AH for pressing charges after her college roommate served her tofu bacon and lied about it, with the same mentality as OP here, trying to pull a \"gotcha\" about the taste of fake meat. Well... Poster was hospitalized because of a severe soy allergy, and the roommate was charged with a felony, sent to jail, and expelled from the university. And their parents ended up being ordered to pay all the medical expenses and for the tuition from the courses the poster had to retake because they were hospitalized during finals. The roommate was not aware that the poster had an allergy, and the court decided it did not matter because they had deliberately lied about what was being served, which proved malicious intent.\n\nMoral is, you don't fuck with people's food.

The class rule was we could eat but without disrupting the rest of the class. One bag was regular peas the other was wasabi peas, after class my teacher asked for some of the peas and I thought it would be funny to pour him some from the wasabi peas. So when he held out his hand I tipped the wasabi peas into it, then stood back to see his reaction. He starts gagging and spat them out and asked me, \"Did you give me *wasabi*?\" And I grinned, so he continues \"I'm allergic to wasabi.\" My face fell and I'm in full panic thinking \"Oh no oh no oh no.\" So as I start to apologize and incoherently ask what I should do he took a deep breath and told me very sternly, \"I don't have any allergies. However, I saw you switch the bags and I imagine that if you're willing to do this to your science teacher then you're likely to do this to another student, someone who might actually have an allergy to wasabi.

There was a time when I wouldn't have thought twice about what I put in my mouth (as an omnivore) and so I wouldn't seen the big deal of what OP did. \n\nBut now I do understand the value of knowing what you consume and the right to be in full control of what you put in your body. I once was fed ham thanks to a careless waiter who gave bad information and when I suddenly realized I'd been eating it, I got very emotional. I was so embarrassed at my own reaction and ran to the bathroom because logically, I felt that I shouldn't care that much. When I went back to the table, I apologized and said I have no idea what came over me and my dad said, \"it's because it's almost like a violation.\" It sounds dramatic, I know. But it did make me see that what we put in our mouths is what we are choosing to let into our bodies. Even when we choose to take risks or consume something foreign or even play games about not knowing what you're eating, you're doing so with full agency.\n\nThere's a reason there's so much legislation around nutrition labels and listed ingredients.

Because yes, feeding omnivores vegetables is different than feeding vegetarians meat. But it\u2019s the way that you\u2019re looking down on the person that you supposedly love, making a joke about what they do and don\u2019t like. \n\nHonestly, this reminds me of shit like waiters or other food staff giving people Diet Coke instead of the regular they ordered, or vice versa. It\u2019s the \u201cI know better than you\u201d mentality that rubs me the wrong way. I try to eat a couple meatless meals a week. A lot of the meat substitutes are hit or miss. I love some and gag when I try others. The son and husband have every right to say they don\u2019t feel like trying it. It doesn\u2019t sound like they are talking down to the daughters and wife for eating vegetarian, trying to convince them to eat meat, it sounds like they just don\u2019t want to try vegetarian food. And that\u2019s fine!\n\nLike some others suggested, OP could have made both recipes and told her son and husband about it and they could have CHOSEN to try both and see how they compare. Because maybe then they would have been pleasantly surprised about how good it was and would be open to trying more, but that is definitely not  going to happen now. In fact, since OP tried to say it\u2019s just prank, they might prank back. And while again I see how it\u2019s apples to oranges with feeding vegetarians meat and omnivores veggies, the son and dad probably wouldn\u2019t consider tricking them into eating if they hadn\u2019t been pranked first.",
