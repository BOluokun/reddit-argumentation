So with that said, my best friend (let\u2019s call her A) has something wrong with her and I am trying to help her, she is struggling with conveying any positive emotions even though she still feels them, I started noticing some similarities in some of the things she was struggling with and some of the things my cousin (who is on the spectrum) does, so I brought up the topic to her and she started crying saying that she knows it might not be but she just was worried at the thought that this might not go away, she was crying and my other friends came over and noticed and asked her what was wrong she asked me to tell them for her and I did, they seemed okay but then this afternoon in the middle of a conversation one of my other friends (let\u2019s call him B) tried telling me that \u201cA doesn\u2019t have autism you know\u201d I tried explaining that we whernt saying she does just that she might have something wrong and that\u2019s a possibility, B said okay and that it\u2019s good we whernt self diagnosing, I asked if he was mad at me, and he left me in read, I could tell most of my friends where mad at me and maybe even A too So I messaged them all to ask them if they where mad, 2 left me in read and 2 said no, one of my friends who said no (let\u2019s call her C) told me that The two friends that are mad at me get mad at me a lot because I (in Cs exact words) \u201c Oh they (the two who are mad) only feel like that cause u keep asking them (if I have done something wrong) and when u think someone is mad at you you act differently and they don't like it I guess\u201d I asked her if she does to and she said that yeah sometimes she gets a little mad at me for it to, so like, am I the ass hole here?",

Your entire exsistance is currently \u201ddrama\u201d, and in a few years you\u2019ll realize non of it really mattered\n\nThat being said: Stop constantly asking if people are mad at you every time anything happens. If they are mad, you asking is not going to help. If they aren\u2019t mad, every time you ask you\u2019ll push them closer to being mad. Just. Stop. Asking.",

I think this is why many people say they would never go back to being a teenager. It\u2019s a stressful time. If I could go back to these years I would tell myself to be confident as possible as this is the most attractive trait you can have.",

None of the details will matter at some point.\n\nWhen A was having troubles, you basically did suggest maybe she has autism and that is self diagnosing. Which comes across poorly (words that come to mind include needy, attention seeking, but nothing quite fits). It just fits into a negative stereotype even though you meant well.\n\nSo you\u2019ve done something that has now annoyed your friends a bit. Instead of quietly letting the whole thing blow over (because this isn\u2019t the kind of thing you can apologize to a group for without making it worse you know?) and not doing it again, you\u2019ve started to annoy them by trying to make them engage you. Again bringing the attention to yourself.\n\nYou don\u2019t mean to do this, you don\u2019t mean to come across as attention seeking, you probably mean well by all of this. Just trying to be a good friend and help someone.\n\nBut next time, it would be far more appropriate to say something like \u201cmaybe you should talk to the guidance councillor\u201d (or school nurse/therapist/whatever that person is at your school most have them). Those adults are there to help you guys.\n\nThey can then handle it with the adults, they can connect her to other people if she does need help managing her mental health for any reason.\n\nEdit: P.S. this is all totally normal. Reddit is full of people who have been exactly in your shoes including me. I\u2019ve been that little asshole kid before too. I was(am) a very sad and lonely little girl. I\u2019m just old enough now to understand myself and my feelings better that\u2019s all. Don\u2019t be hard on yourself, loving yourself helps everything.",

I think this could be an eye opener for you to realize how your actions affect your friends and in what ways. Learn from this and move forward appropriately. Perhaps the lesson here is not to keep asking if people are mad at you and just leave it be. They are your friends, trust them to be ok with you at the end of the day.",

There\u2019s subtle differences in the way I hold myself when I\u2019m worried or self-conscious, my friends can pick up on it in a heartbeat. \n\nInstead of asking \u2018are you angry at me?\u2019 Try to remind yourself that people make mistakes, we often try to deny things to cope with the flood of emotions and people can get mad for short times but it won\u2019t kill your friendships. Accepting that sometimes people just leave you on read while trying to get their (possibly irrational) emotions under control before talking again is important. \n\nI hope A can get a doctors opinion on the situation to at least find out if it\u2019s real or not. It\u2019s clear you care about them.\n\nBe kind to them, but as always be kind to yourself.",
