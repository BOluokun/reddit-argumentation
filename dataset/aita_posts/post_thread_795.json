  "post content": "AITA: \n\nOk to start of I 36f and him 37m met while working together.. we became really great friends while working and then feeling started to emerge. We decided to start dating.. I come from a relationship with 3 kids 16f 14m 7f and he has a son 7m.. \n\nWe started dating and i slowly introduced him to my babies because I\u2019m extremely protective of my children.. well everything was going great and then one day he told me that if we were going to be together for a long time I need to let him be a part of our family. I said ok that\u2019s fine but decisions about the kids isn\u2019t his place that\u2019s between me and their father. I don\u2019t think that was wrong but he then got angry and told me if we are going to be married then he has a say so with my kids and I looked at him and laughed and told him ummm nooo I don\u2019t tell you what to do with your child because thats your child ( which by this point still haven\u2019t met) \n\nWe\u2019ll have have been together for 3 years now and he still thinks he has more of a say so with my children. I tell him to stay in his lane because he isn\u2019t the father nor the mother and he can\u2019t tell me how to raise my children when he has nothing to do with his own child. He says I pay child support that\u2019s enough. I agin tell him that there\u2019s more then then just throwing money at a child to say I\u2019m a parent that\u2019s not how that works and if he wants to be a dad then go be a daddy to your own child and leave mine alone.( he tells me how I need to punish my children and when we can go do things together) and I of course don\u2019t listen because why the fuck would I. Yes I do leave him out of a lot of outings because he complains that I ignore him and focus on them more then anything. I tell him to suck it up because he\u2019s a grown man and I don\u2019t need to mother him\u2026 but every time we get into an argument about kids I throw his in his face and tell him don\u2019t parent mine or try when you don\u2019t try with yours am I the asshole for this?\n\nI am solely responsible for my children. I pay for everything for them once he paid for a craft for my oldest and he throws in my face that he paid for something. I pay for everything insurance for our cars and food and rent.. and when I ask for help he tells me no I need money for other things..\n\nHe doesn\u2019t see his child because he doesn\u2019t like his baby momma. He wants to wait until he\u2019s old enough to come live with us so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with her.. I have offered to pay for an attorney so we can get split custody and see him but he turns it down.. I have tried honestly to get him to see his child but he tells me no I can wait..,",
