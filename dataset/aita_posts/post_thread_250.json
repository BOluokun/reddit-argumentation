  "post content": "So, this girl, Nicole(16), started going to my (16f) school after winter break. She\u2019s a little weird tbh. She doesn\u2019t talk a lot and when she does talk, she\u2019s so quiet that you can barely hear her. \n\nShe used to eat in her car but one of my friends felt bad for her and invited her to eat with us. I noticed that all of her lunches had a little piece of paper and she\u2019d read it, smile for like 2 seconds, then fold it up and put it in a pocket in her lunchbox. Sometimes she\u2019d take it out and read it a couple times during lunch.\n\nI eventually asked what it is and she said she has a nanny and she writes her notes every day. I asked if she thinks that\u2019s a little embarrassing because I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s had notes in their lunches past 5th grade. \n\nShe got kinda defensive and said that her nanny does similar things for her siblings, who are all in preschool or elementary school so it kinda proved my point. \n\nShe started eating in her car again and one of my friends got mad at me because apparently she had a really bad home life before moving here and she\u2019s never had anyone do that stuff for her. Idk how tf she expected me to know, considering she usually only talks about school but it\u2019s starting some drama in my friend group so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.",
