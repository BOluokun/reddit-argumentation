She has already almost hit a pedestrian, and has made some ridiculous driving decisions while I was in the car. All in all, girlfriend sucks at driving, with all due respect.\n\nHer car is outside her parents' bedroom window so her mom can literally look outside and see that I'm in the passenger seat. She wanted to take her own car to put gas in it. I'm okay with my girlfriend driving when there's barely any traffic and especially pedestrians. But at night, everyone is going home and people are out driving like idiots. I told her she can drive another time, and I should drive across town.\n\nBy the way, this friend has her own car and can easily drive, but chose not to because \"she doesn't like driving.\"\n\nMy girlfriend put gas in her car and we were ready to go, and I told her she shouldn't drive at night because it's a bit more risky. She started yelling at me and I got tired of it so I just gave her the keys. On the way there, she cut off a handful of people and the way she stops the car is so bad that I can't take it anymore. She promised me I will drive home on the way home, and she started getting mad at me again.\n\nI don't feel good about her driving at night, because she has a permit and you can tell by the way she drives that she is an amateur. She sometimes strays in between two lanes, and if a cop happens to pull her over, I'm screwed too, since  I'm not old enough to be in the car with us two by ourselves if she is behind the wheel. Now I am the one who gets in trouble too.\n\nI told her and her friend that we picked up and they started ridiculing me. I don't want to break the law when it was easily avoidable, and if I get caught, I would get a hefty fine.\n\nSo AITA for trying to not let my girlfriend drive?\n\nEdit: I am 18 years old. For this to not be illegal, I have to have a license and be over 21 or 25. I\u2019ve had my license for a year and a half, but if we get pulled over, I\u2019m breaking the law as much as she is. I can save myself by playing dumb, but am I really going to do that to my girlfriend?",
