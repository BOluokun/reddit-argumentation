  "post content": "On mobile, non-english speaker, sorry for any flaws.\n\nI\u2019m a manager at a company with 50-isch employees. Me and two other managers. I manage three teams of 8-9 people, one of them beeing \u201dMike\u201d, 52m. \n\nWhat we do at our firm don\u2019t matter here, but it is highly skilled and very well paid. Training a new employee takes more than a year and is very expensive.\n\nMike joined us three years ago. Good impression, great feedback from former managers. Started off well, but the past year things have taken a turn. He\u2019s sloppy, slow and the quality isn\u2019t up to standard, so his colleagues have to lend a hand. He\u2019s not taking part in meetings, logging in late and going home early. He doesn\u2019t answer calls or e-mails. Rude to co-workers nad management, told anothee manager to \u201dfuck off\u201d and got written up. I\u2019ve repetedly askes but Mike says he\u2019s got no problems, no illness, no substance abuse.\n\nWe do two products, one rather easy and quick and one that requires time and skill. Important for later.\nTwo weeks ago was Mikes yearly rewiev. We have a system where you\u2019re rewieved on 1. teamwork and taking responsibility, producing good quality etc. 2, the number of \u201dquick\u201d products you do and 3, the number of \u201dquality\u201d products you do.\n\nCheck one box - get a slight raise. Two -bigger raise. Etc. Everyone gets a raise equal to inflation, even if no boxes are checked. \n\nI got handed the production stats for Mike from our budget guy \u201dPaul\u201d. Mike started our meeting bragging about how many products he makes and he should get a good raise. I look at the numbers and Mike haven\u2019t done even half of his requirements. Poor quality, and as stated a horrid behaviour. So no raise above the inlation mark.\n\nMike breaks down and admitts he\u2019s an alchoholic. Drinks every day, even at work. Wife left him cause of it a few months ago. With everything in the open, we talk and long story short he\u2019s now in rehab and then couples therapy that we pay for. He\u2019d on paid leave.\n\nThis weak I check the numbers Paul gave me. He did it wrong; Mike is in fact one of the most productive teammembers. Still bad quality and team-work, but he would have been up for a much higher raise had I known.\n\nI decided to not say anything. This reality-check actually helped Mike out, big time. He will get a raise when he\u2019s back at work.\n\nTold my wife and she thinks I\u2019m an a-hole. He did what he had to do to get a raise, and I\u2019m decieving him from his pay raise.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

He was bragging about his metrics, he very probably used it as proof that his drinking was not a problem. That he could still do his job.
