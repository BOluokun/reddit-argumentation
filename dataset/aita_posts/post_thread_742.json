  "post content": "... and apparently starting WWIII.\n\nMy husband and his brother go back and forth every Christmas about this gift list for their kids. The kids make the lists and we are expected to buy their presents off this list, and never anything else. We enjoy picking unique gifts we think would be fun and different so... sometimes we do.\n\nLast year they became very belligerent when they thought we hadn't bought items off the list in a timely (for them) manner and insinuated we would ruin their Christmas.\n\nThis year we decided to buy a gift NOT on the list (one niece had only gift cards left) \nand brother stated that they previewed the gift, an age appropriate game from an educational site and stated \"this does not play to her strengths, we will return in and give her a replacement\". He said it gives her anxiety to get something that isn't on her list.\n\nMy husband and I were a upset by this. 50% by the fact that they didnt give it to her, and 50% by the fact that he told us he wasnt going to give it to her. I mean as parents they can do whatever they want with gifts but I believe you shouldnt make the gift giver feel badly.\n\nMy husbad replied to his brother that the message was unkind and we were sorry to hear it and disappointed she didnt like it (we thought they had given her the gift) but in the future just say something polite if you hate our gifts. \n\nBrother became incensed and told us if via a long scathing, condescending reply, saying that because we didn't consider the neices feelings on the matter we are contributing to \"subjugating them (the neices) as female children \" and they (brother and SIL)  will be deeply offended if our children don't enjoy the archaeological texts they bought our 16 month old or the my little pony outfits they bought our 17 year old. (I assume this is sarcasm, not their real gifts).\n\nHowever the nieces are caught in the middle. My husband cut off contact with his brother at this point and blocked his texts and calls. Said only cards for all kids from now on. But we want to have a relationship with the nieces, maybe not so much with brother. \n It feels like a relationship-destroying act(s). \n\nBut are we just the a**holes because we should have just sucked it up and bought the gift cards off the neices gift list?",
