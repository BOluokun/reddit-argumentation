  "post content": "My mother, I love her great Mom, but we were going out party of 15, we were at her house prior to going out to a chain restaurant and she had a cake she wanted to bring to the restaurant. I said you can't take your own cake to a restaurant that sells desserts. \n\nMy argument, that I told her was that it puts the server in a bad position since most likely it's against the chain restaurants rules, their manager might tell them to cut it off, then they in turn feel like an asshole for having to tell us we can't bring outside food in and then feeling like they are risking their tip, and I think my mother would get upset as well. Just mad inside you know like a Mom.\n\nShe didn't agree, she left the cake we returned after the restaurant and we all ate. My nephew lives closer to the restaurant he didn't want to drive all the way back but still it's just you can't bring outside food is my position only because I think it sucks for the server or a family owned place I definitely say no. \n\nMy Mom was angry at my position. AITA?\n\nEdit: Never knew of a cake cutting fee, just seemed crazy to bring in outside food to a restaurant to me. Kind of like a slippery slope, I don't like Pepsi so I brought a 2 liter of Coke for the party. \n\nI called my Mom said I was wrong and it is fine as long as we call ahead, I apologized.",

Some restaurants allow it, others don\u2019t. Some allow it but charge a fee. Then if the restaurant policy allows it you do it and if not you don\u2019t bring your cake or go elsewhere. Simple!
