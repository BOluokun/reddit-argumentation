  "post content": "I f(20) and husband m(22) have been getting in a lot of fights. I am currently 38 weeks pregnant and I have rules for when the baby comes. No kissing, and no pictures of the baby posted online. I also wanted to not have visitors for the first two weeks, which was denied because \" its not fair for everyone else\". My husband had a talk with mil and fil and a huge dispute happen. My mil was not happy with the no kissing rule because she said \"She loves having babies on her chest and kissing them\". My husband tried to enforce the rule but she was very upset. He came to me and told me to allow her to kiss the baby on the head and I said no kissing a new born because of disses and germs. He told me I need to make a compromise and give that up to make his mom happy. I don't want to because people can't simply understand that kissing a newborn in dangerous. He tried doing a lot of math and statistics to show me it's not a big deal and how unlikely the baby is to get sick. He told me I am being absurd and controlling, and since other people will follow my other rules, then I should allow his mom and grandma to kiss the baby. To which I said no still, and it's not negotiable because they can all wait. Then I exploded when he told me that he invited them to come up 2 hours after the baby was born. Because according to him  that is all I need to recover. I don't want people there right away because I will be in pain, bleeding, and still dirty in a gown. Not to mention that there will be people coming in to look at my private parts often after giving birth. I feel like the hospital should be my safe space to recover and bond with the baby and that the decision to invite people when I am ready is up to me, not to him. He said that it is his baby too, and it's not all about me. His mom is also very pushy and manipulative to the point where she told him that she wouldn't come meet the baby if she could not kiss it. She has also made comments that attacked me about my body size and the babies size. She has also claimed the baby as \"My baby\". She is just notorious for not following rules and doing whatever she wants.So am I the a-hole for not wanting people there right away and kissing my baby?\n\nUpdate: \n\nI talked to my husband today when we where heading for our final growth ultrasound since I have gestational diabetes. He told me that he stood firm with his parents and that they will not be kissing the baby. But he still thinks I should surprise his mom by allowing her one kiss in the back of the babies head. To which I still said no because they can wait till she gets her vaccines, since none of then will be vaccinated. I clarified that people can come meet the baby right away, but first I have to be okay from delivering He said he will wait till I am ready and that we won't have people there for long. Which makes me feel much better because I been having horrible experience throughtout my pregnancy, at the hospital. I just know I will be in some much pain after this, and I want to feel good before entertaining people. When he told me about the discusi\u00f3n he had he made it sound like he backed out of what he had both previously agreed on. But he did not. I also have agreed to let him have people over, with the one condition that I will not be taking care of his guest. And if I want the baby back for feeding or to sleep they need to give me the baby and respect the fact that we will be tired. He assured he will take care of his guest, and the house, and the boundaries. Today he asked me how he can help me feel less stressed out. I told him he could help me clean and get ready for the baby. He just left for lowes to build the baby a changing table attachment for the crib. He also agreed to not let people make more rule comments about my size and the babies size, or in general he said he will call out any rule comments towards me. As I have heard many through this pregnacy like \"you are too small\", \"you are starving the baby\", \"You don't look pregnant\". Just pretty much comments that where attacking me since they had \"big healthy babies\". My baby is supper healthy but she won't be 10 pounds as my family only has 6 to 8 pound babies. But I am glad he won't let people, keep making me feel bad. Or be rule to me. I think all that was needed was some time and more talking.\n\nUpdate 2: \n\nThank you all for the advise. I think that my husband was just upset and scared when he said those things. We where both upset, and ge felt like I was trying to leave his family out of out our babies life and dictate all the rules, without him having a say. Which I get is not fair of me because he is right that once that baby is out we are both going to have to be together and make decision for a little person. Which I was not trying to do. I am a high risk pregnancy and a lot can go wrong with me and the baby. I dont know how weak we will both come out of this experinece.However he now understands that I will be vulnerable and that after I give birth it is about my recovery and time together as a new family. I also talked to my mom and she thinks that I just just need to lay back and let people come to the hospital to meet baby right away because they are excited. However she said to not let them stay for long periods of time and take away that bonding time because that is selfish and rude of them. Because it's not about them, but they have the right to meet the baby right away since they are the babies family. My MIL is still not happy and has called many people to complain about how she should be able whatever she wants. Some people have told her it's not her child and to just respect the rules. To which she just hangs up. My husband I think started to see that this kinda absurd of people because they feel entittled to our child. So he said that if people don't follow the rules he will take the baby and kick them out. I also added this to my birth plan, and plan to have  a nurse supervise the visitors when they come in for more support. It's hospital policy that only 2 people can come up at a time  so that makes me feel much better. Since there is a smaller chance I will attacked and ambushed by the people in his family that dont agree with me. I can compromise to having people go in meet the baby and let us rest, heal, and bond. Right now me and husband have both agreed that I just need to stay calm, and relax as I have been having some complications from the stress of this whole situation. For those saying I knew what I was getting my self into. I knew how bad it was with his the other grandchild, but his mom was nice to me until I got pregnant, and she became judgmental and territorial of the baby inside of me. We had also planed to not have kids but unplaned pregnancies are a thing. They also had talked many times about how they apologized to the my husbands brothers wife for trying to hold and kiss the baby while they where sick and how they knew better now. But it's clear now that they have still not learned, and that it was an empty apology to the other DIL. I think I will be going into labor soon, as I have had a lot of signs in the past 2 days. I am just patiently waiting, and I trust my husband to be by my side and protect us.  He is not abusive, and we have been together for about 6 years now. We have never had this issue before and it's mainly because I had never been previously attacked or made feel bad by his mom until I got pregnant. Not to mention, she does not engage in the rude behavior around her son. For example after our baby shower she got me alone before she left and told me \"take care of MY BABY\", she made sure he was not around.",

No. So why take the route with any risk of harm when the other path is completely zero risk?\n\nYou take the zero risk path.\n\nIf you have friends or family in the area who will back you up, get with them. You do not need people who will try to break down your smart decision-making post-partum. You want someone in that room who when your husband inevitably asks, 'seriously just let my mom...' tells him to shut the fuck up. This isn't about his mom. This isn't about what keeps the peace. This is the health and safety of an hours old baby and the recovery of a person who just birthed an entire human. Get an advocate for you for when you are tired, exhausted, overwhelmed, anxious, on drugs, asleep, etc. Keep that person close.\n\nYour husband is siding with his mother and is threatening abandonment during the end stages of your pregnancy. That is so far outside acceptable behavior.\n\nThere is zero reason to trust he won't try to pressure you in the hospital or allow his mother in. Tell your nurses to ban her from the hospital room and make sure your MIL doesn't see baby at all. Those are reasonable rules based on medical advice and you know it. She will absolutely lie and kiss baby and there's no reason to trust her adhering to rules. Not right now.\n\nYou are making solid choices. Do not doubt that.
