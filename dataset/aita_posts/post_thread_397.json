  "post content": "I (17m) have two sisters, Alice (29) and Miranda (33). I am much closer to Alice than I am to Miranda. Miranda is also not on good terms with our parents. Alice has four kids and is currently expecting child number five, while Miranda can\u2019t have children which her ex divorced her for. Miranda is very successful in life, she has a nice apartment, works a good job and earns a decent amount of money. Alice, on the other hand, is struggling financially. She had her first kid right out of high school and got pregnant with her second child soon after, so she decided to become a SAHM to her children while her boyfriend provides for them.\n\nMe and my parents try to help them out as much as possible, be it childcare or money, whatever she needs. I love my nieces and nephews. I take them to the park and play with the older ones, I really enjoy it. Miranda doesn\u2019t help out with them, she says it\u2019s because she\u2019s too busy. Well, she works long hours, but she doesn\u2019t have kids, so I don\u2019t know what she does on weekends. She also doesn\u2019t help out financially, which I find unfair, since she makes so much money and all she does is spend it on herself, although she does give us very nice gifts for Christmas and birthdays. My parents nag her about it, saying she should give some of her money to Alice monthly, and I agree with that.\n\nSo, here comes the part where I may have been an asshole. I was at Miranda\u2019s place last week, as she baked muffins and invited me over to eat some and catch up. We got on the topic of Christmas presents and I told her some of the stuff I wanted. She nodded and said she would give our parents a coupon for a much needed vacation and Alice some clothes she had mentioned and also some new boots and jackets for her kids. I was a little stunned she didn\u2019t have more for Alice, so I asked, \u201cWhy do you only get Alice the bare minimum? You can afford to help out more and you refuse to out of spite.\u201d\n\nMiranda looked at me and laughed. She said it wasn\u2019t her business to feed six people, that Alice was old enough to make her choices and live with the consequences. She knew what she was getting herself into and that she wouldn\u2019t pay Alice\u2019s way through life just because she kept having children she couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nI was stunned at how cold she reacted. I asked her how she could live her life being so selfish and uncaring, and she got angry and told me, \u201cListen, kid, there are some thing you are way too young for to be discussing with me, and this is one of those. Drop the subject or get out.\u201d I got really frustrated with her and said something I probably shouldn\u2019t have. I told her, \u201cNo wonder your husband divorced you, even if you could have children, you would be a terrible mother.\u201d Miranda got very quiet and told me to leave and never come back.\n\nShe has now blocked me on everything, and though I don\u2019t agree with her not helping out, I\u2019m starting to feel guilty for what I said. So, AITA?",

She has absolutely no obligation to give HER money away if she doesn\u2019t want too. You and your family expecting Miranda to give HER money to her sister that can\u2019t afford her lifestyle is greedy. Yes your sister Alice kept having kids, it was HER choice to keep having them. No one owes your sister anything because of the choices SHE made, especially her sister.",

Winter gear for 4 kids is very expensive. Source: We have 4 kids here, one in college, but still buy her necessities because we want ALL her focus on school.

I can\u2019t imagine the level of entitlement to think the older sibling should give a monthly allowance just because she popped out 4 kids. Honestly, if Alice was single or had one accidental kid and was struggling with unemployment this would be a more valid request\u2026still not entitled to it, just asking for help in that situation would seem less tacky.\n\nEdit: My bad, Alice has FIVE kids, five kids they expect her older sister to help with. I\u2019m confused as to why Alice and her partner NEED childcare help. She wants to be a stay home mom, but expects others to babysit their weekends away?

      "content": "YTA for your comment. ESH as a family to Miranda but I would add one thing that I think people are missing here.\n\nOP: you are 17 which is old enough to get your ass whooped internet style on AITA for being cruel. But you are also still a kid and I think it\u2019s important to look at the **age gap** here. Both Alice and Miranda are quite close in age and then you are so much younger they are pretty much another generation to you right now and had a whole childhood before you arrived. You are the \u2018only child with older siblings\u2019 age gap gulf that means you have a totally different sibling and parent dynamic to their upbringing so you honestly have no damned idea what might run deeper.\n\nAlso Alice had her first kid around the age you are now so your niblings are closer in age to you that your siblings who I believe are full sibs right not half with a remarriage? So you don\u2019t really remember much of a time when Alice wasn\u2019t having kids and your parents weren\u2019t focusing a lot on Alice and their grand kids so it sounds like its been normalized that you as only maybe 5 or 6 years older as uncle have been parentified into caring for or sharing your childhood with your nieces and nephews. Alice has been taking your childhood to raise her FIVE kids. Your mom and dad were complicit in that and by the sound of it at least expected Miranda to pay her dues finanicially by big ticket gifts to you and them if she refused to physically parent any of the minor kids or her sister.\n\nOP: Miranda set a boundary not to enmesh herself in a toxic situation that you have been done dirty by too. You are the only son so there might be some golden child/scapegoat dynamics here too. But here\u2019s the thing, a gilded cage is still a cage. You are giving up your weekends when you should be studying, dating, making friends, being a teen, having a job and establishing self and independence to look after your sister\u2019s kids that their two parents amd your two parents can\u2019t raise. You are mad at Miranda when it\u2019s you who runs the risk of still being at home at Alice\u2019s age giving up your life to give her kids your chances and not realising the person here to model yourself on is Miranda. She is the person who can also help you disentangle yourself but her attempts to keep herself \u2018clean\u2019 of the mess resulted you flinging shit in her face.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker. Miranda can and does survive and thrive without the enmeshed shitshow of your family. She will be just fine without you. But you just fucked yourself and destroyed the one ally you could have had to help you realise you are in a sinking ship. The lifeboat sailed because you didn\u2019t just vent your genuine issues to Miranda like an overwhelmed teen might reasonably do and apologised. You went so low and so cruel you sailed her off by cutting the tow rope. The fact you went there when and how you did shows that you had been thinking and sitting on this and she knows that while she kept a spot on her raft for you until she knew, you never had any room for her.\n\nMiranda will very likely take this last cut and free herself and create a whole new life without family. You will feel the trappings of this asshole moment forever **because you still don\u2019t think you were wrong. You still think you had a point and she\u2019s overreacting**. You are mad because Miranda is exposing your asshole not because you\u2019ve blushed at the realisation you are one. You aren\u2019t apologetic. You are just sorry you kicked your lifeboat too hard and can\u2019t catch it.\n\nAt this point continuing to try to contact Miranda is not apologising or peacemaking. It\u2019s justification and it comes from the wrong place for her to trust you. You have to leave her be and see if she ever trusts you again by how you act. Trust is built with a spoon and broken with a shovel as they say.\n\nWhile Miranda is out of your life you might want to look at the people actually driling holes in your boat though as to why your ass is also wet\u2026",

              "content": "Thank you so much. Both my parents are the same \u2018only child with siblings\u2019 huge gap to their sibs and thus I have seen how in how in one, they were expected to parent themselves because \u2018grandbabies!\u2019 with older sibling and in the other my parent remains seethingly resentful their older siblings did not dedicate their teens and early 20s to raising them as if a surprise sibling 15 years younger was a gift not a massive derail.\n\nMy partner is 13 years older than her sister and they have never lived together due to economics and it takes a huge amount of work for them to retain a sibling dynamic not parentification. I think big age gap sibling scenarios tend to have similar extra pink flags as age gap dating unless handled equally carefully.\n\nBirth order and gender plays a huge role in families anyway and to a certain extent all siblings have different parents to each other even if they grow up in the same family because each \u2018combination\u2019 varies on personality, age, circumstances. Add in very real differences like stage of life of parents (young vs now grandparents) or huge social changes. The older ones are firmly millennial. OP is Gen Z. Parents are probably Gen X and they are the ones who straddle pre-digital and post and most likely to have an almost \u2018split\u2019 attitude because of it. I\u2019m 43 and the number of my peers who were wildly unconventional pre internet who have teen kids or young grandkids and gone really trad and vice versa throws me. I don\u2019t recognise a lot of my Gen X peers because they got sort of forgotten between boomers and millennials and often did not learn good boundaries so raise equally screwed up kids as them but think they broke their parents\u2019 patterns.\n\nI\u2019ve rarely seen really big age gap sibling relationships go easily unless the parents were very emotionally aware throughout. And since I\u2019m Irish my sample is skewed. There was a horrifying number of people I know with \u2018big age gaps\u2019 who discovered their sister was their mother. We had a very dark joke about \u2018what you got for your 18th: a car or a new mum?\u2019 Spoiler, no one I knew got a car \ud83d\ude2c",

The only ones obliged to pay a dime for those children are her and her boyfriend; anyone else giving them time, money, or attention is purely at the givers discretion. She likely already takes advantage of whatever state assistance to help raise them, as well as pools in money from their father, her (and your) parents (whose main focus should be raising their own underage child), and then nabs time away from you (at your age, time is both money and opportunities you won't be offered later). I understand helping because you love her and the niblings, but she has taken extreme advantage of all of you, proceeded to pop out yet more children, and then is asking for yet more. There is absolutely no reason for this woman to have five children, one or two oppsie babies I can see, but five? She having them intentionally and excessively. She doesn't support herself, isn't married, and lives off of other people; she cannot afford to take care of herself by herself to begin with and has five little lives depending on her.

Alice's financial straits are largely her own fault although it feels a little harsh to say that. If she was struggling at the beginning with two children, there is no reason she should be about to have a fifth child that she cannot afford. However, her choices are her choices. That doesn't mean Miranda needs to cover for her choices by offering up money she has worked hard for. Miranda likely realizes that Alice will never turn things around if people continue to fund her life for her. No one is ever entitled to help from anyone. Miranda seems like she has a good head on her shoulders, she always buys \"really nice presents\" according to you for all of you which costs a fair bit of money in and of itself. And here you are, backstabbing her by hitting her with the lowest of blows. Do not be surprised if your relationship is never the same after this.  \n\n\nEdit: I JUST SAW YOUR REASONING IN THE JUDGEMENT BOT!
