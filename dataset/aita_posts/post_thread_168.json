  "post content": "EDIT: Thanks for the responses.\n\nThe friend apparantly already had my number for some months, my roommate once asked me if she can give it to her because she wanted to contact me for a project. She never contacted me though, so I didn't have hers.\n\nEDIT 2: About the \"drugged\" part: she claims that she was invited to try a pill by a friend, but the friend didn't tell her what it was, how strong it was and how long it would last, then she was abandoned by this friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis happened two nights ago. My (mid 20ies, nonbinary) roommate is away visiting her family and I'm alone in the apartment.\n\nWe have an agreement that we don't have guests while we're not there ourselves. I inisted on this agreement because in the beginning, my roommate would give her keys to friends. Her friends would bring other friends, and apart from leaving the apartment dirty, it became a saftey concern.\n\nSo the other night at 02:30am the doorbell rang. I wasn't expecting anyone, so I ignored the first time. The second time, I went to check it out. We don't have a camera, we only have a microphone. \"Who's there?\" I asked. \"Can you open the door, pleeeease?\" asked a voice I couldn't identify. I couldn't even tell if it's a man or a woman. \"Who are you?\" I asked again. \"Please open?\" repeated the voice and rang again. \"Can you hear me?\" I asked. \"Yes I can hear you, open the door!\" I then heard the person walking away so I decided that they were probably mistaken. Around 03:00am the doorbell rang again. \"I won't open unless you tell me who you are.\" I said through the microphone. \"Huh, gosh!\" said the voice angrily and continued to ring. I was very uncomfortable and made sure the door was well locked. I informed my partner on what was happening. While I was on the phone I received a message by an unknown number. It said \"\\[my name\\] OPEN THE DOOR\". I saved the number and opened a messenger service to check out if I can find anything out about the person. There was no name displayed, but a blurry photo. I could recognize the person on the photo as a friend of my roommate I saw once. I couldn't remember her name, so I texted back \"are you \\[roommate\\]'s friend, the one with the bicycle tattoo?\" But there was no response anymore. I gave a quick call to the police about the incident, they said they would check out the street. I browsed a bit on my phone and at 04:15 i went back to sleep.\n\nToday my roommate called me. She said it was an a-hole move to leave her friend outside, since it was obvious that she was alone and drugged. And that she could not respond to my questions because of the drugs. My roommate thinks I should have at least gone down to the main door to take a look at the stranger.\n\nI for my part don't think I have to open the door to someone who doesn't tell me their name, especially when they seem drugged and I'm home alone.\n\nThe girl apparently the sat at a nearby bench for a while before she managed to call a uber that brought her to her own home. But she mostly has a blackout from that night.",
