  "post content": "Background: My husband (let\u2019s call him Will) is in the Navy, and he works on nuclear reactors on submarines. We\u2019ve been together for 4 years, married for 2.\n\nWe were at a small house party with a few friends of mine from college and we were discussing books we\u2019ve all read, when at one point one of my friends (let\u2019s call him Steve) asks Will, \u201cSo Will, what\u2019s your favorite book?\u201d and my husband responds, \u201cOh, I really like To Kill A Mockingbird.\u201d Then Steve gives him a quizzical look and asks him, \u201cHave you read any books outside of high school?\u201d and Will hesitates a bit and says, \u201cOutside of manuals at work, I guess I haven\u2019t.\u201d So then I try to explain to Steve, \u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s not well educated, so he\u2019s never had a reason to be well read.\u201d We all had a good laugh, but then Will didn\u2019t really contribute a whole lot to the conversation the rest of the night. \n\nOn the car ride back, Will was pretty quiet. I ask if he\u2019s fine and all he says in a sarcastic tone is, \u201cPeachy.\u201d I ask him if I did anything to upset him and he responds back with, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m educated enough to properly explain myself.\u201d I tell him I didn\u2019t tell my friends that he was unintelligent, just that he wasn\u2019t college educated. He accused me of minimizing how hard his Navy schooling was, but I explained that military education and college education are simply not the same. We continued to fight until we got home. I texted my sister about what happened and she called me a huge asshole and that I need to apologize and now I\u2019m having second thoughts about how I handled this. AITA Reddit?",

EVER!!!\n\nLet's circle back to the job... do understand what it takes to get onto a nuke sub??? These folks go through extensive testing to be even considered. Then they go through even more extensive training and education. These people are super smart. Their job is insanely stressful. \n\nI know two guys who were on nuclear subs. Two of the smartest people I know.  \n\nNot reading fiction doesn't equal being \"uneducated.\" Not everyone likes fiction. Also, maybe he read that book in high school and it really stuck with him. There is a book I read in high school which, many decades later, remains one of my absolute favorite books....I read a LOT of books. \n\nIt was so incredibly rude of your friend to make fun of your husband about his book choice. You and your friends sound like insufferable snobs",

The entire training pipeline, which is about 2 years of college level courses on math, engineering, (nuclear)physics, thermodynamics, material science, chemistry and more, consists of 40-60(+) hours a week of analog studying, ie. absolutely no phones, computers, internet, music, or electronics of any kind. Outside of lectures, it's virtually all quiet. Diving into technical manuals, performing calculations, and creating technical drawings. While you're kept busy for 40-60 hours of week by quietly studying, virtually none of that contributes to your grade. Your grade is based solely on passing closed book finals that are all free response(absolutely no multiple choice). Generally each question on the test requires a whole page worth of calculations, drawings, and technical explanations. Later in your training, assessments become almost entirely oral assessments where you're verbally questioned/grilled and have to respond and often times fill up an entire white board with drawings/calculations/explanations to support/defend what you're presenting. You absolutely are not getting through the program without understanding what you're talking about.\n\nAfter that 2 years of training is done, the hard part finally starts where you're expected to work 60+ hours most weeks in high pressure environments under continuous scrutiny. Constantly sleep deprived yet expected to perform at the highest level because a single mistake can cause an international nuclear incident. \n\nThose were the worst years of my life and during that time I didn't have the privilege of having time/energy to do reading for fun. Now I'm out and am well educated and employed in a completely different field(tech). I have yet to face anything else as academically challenging as what I dealt with in the navy. I'm now happy that I was able to expand my educational horizons beyond the deeply technical studies from my navy days. \n\nAnyone who's gone through the Navy Nuke program not only has a well-above average aptitude, but they also had to have Herculean grit to complete it.",

I'll take a college education any day over that level of life-and-death responsibility for not just myself but anyone in fallout range.  He's responsible for making sure that we don't have a repeat of Chernobyl in our nuclear equipment. \n\nHeck, it puts him in the same class as Jimmy Carter, quite possibly the most ***badass*** president of the 20th century.  In his long career, not only was he president, he also worked on nuclear reactors in the navy, and, with his team, literally walked into a melting-down reactor and fixed it.  Eradicated the Guinea Worm, a really nasty parasitic disease.  Negotiated peace between Egypt and Israel.  Built houses by hand for the poor, as a retirement project. Taught Sunday School for over half a century.\n\nWith work that demanding, it isn't surprising if your husband wants his relaxation time to not involve reading, if he's having to keep up with reading (and possibly working to keep updated) the safety and operation manuals for nuclear reactors. \n\nYou owe him an apology, and it wouldn't hurt for you to learn more about the (non-classified) parts of his responsibilities, so you don't make a fool of yourself downplaying his education, intellect and level of responsibility again.",
