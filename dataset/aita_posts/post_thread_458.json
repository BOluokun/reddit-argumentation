I'll let reddit decide if I am an indeed an a**hole. \n\nOn occasion, I will leave my 3 and 5 year old strapped in their car seats while I go inside to pay for gas and get snacks/coffee. I do ask my kids every time if they want to come in with me and they sometimes do, but most of the time they'd rather stay in the van to draw, color, or read. I'm fine with that choice. As most parents would tell you, getting into and out of car seats can be a hassle. \n\nWhen at our gas station, I always make sure....\n-the kids are warned to stay strapped in their seats (they've never not heeded this warning).\n-the van is off, and I have the keys\n-the doors get locked \n-I'm at the nearest possible pump under the shaded awning\n-I can see the van the whole time from the windows of the station.\n-I'm inside 5 min. or less \n-the kids end up with a snack, too :). \n\nSo is this a reasonable parenting practice or, as my wife sarcastically insists, CPS is going to start an investigation into my daddy decisions, and some bystander is going to call me an asshole for leaving my kids in the car. \n\nAm I an asshole?\n\nClarification: Several have asked...... I'm in Michigan, and I've never gotten back into the car after my 5 min. inside and the temperature had changed by more than a couple degrees inside the van (hot or cold). Also, if I see a huge line inside, I don't wait. 5 min. is the max I am away from the van.",
