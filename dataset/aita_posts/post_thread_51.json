  "post content": "Let's get this out of the way first, my husband and I are currently separated and we are getting divorced. I'm going to file in a week or two, and we've been living separately since I was 6 months pregnant. \n\nWhy you ask? A pretty common occurrence - He was having an affair with a woman and he gave me the ILYBINILWY talk after I caught him. No, he didn't confess. I was suspicious about his late night office hours and tracked him down at his office, only to find him missing. I waited for 3 hours, all alone, and then I saw them both arriving at the office. She was hanging on to him, they kissed inside his car. That's where I confronted both of them. She was crying, and he went on to console her saying it wasn't her fault. \n\n\nThat was 4 months ago, and I moved out of the house heavily pregnant. I moved to a friend's home he didn't know about, and for the next 4 months, I didn't have any contact with him. (My choice) \n\nI didn't inform him when I went into labor. My sister and best friend were there for me. I gave birth to my healthy baby boy and named him after my childhood sweetheart Daniel, my first love, who sadly passed away when he was 20 from leukemia. It was the most heartbreaking thing that ever happened to me. It affected really me bad. \n\nI lost 40 pounds in a month and had to be hospitalized. I still have a hole in my heart, a part of me was lost forever the day I lost him. It took immense therapy and counselling to cope with the grief. I met my husband 6 years later. He was the first guy I fell for after Daniel. We got married 2 years later and after 3 years of marriage, we got pregnant with our first child. \n\nI wanted to wait a few more years, but it was he who pushed for a baby. My husband's name is Phillipe and in his family , the firstborn sons are always named after their father, so we decided to name him Phil. \n\nHowever, after our separation I started experiencing Daniel's presence around me. I was a mess, but I saw dreams where Dan would talk to me and tell me that everything would be okay. \n\nHonestly, I feel like Dan's spirit has helped me heal and gave me strength to cope with the breakdown of my marriage. When my boy was born, I named him Daniel. His middle name was after my grandfather, and I gave him my last name. \n\nA month later, I contacted my husband and informed him that his son was born a month ago, and that I was going to file for divorce and to chalk out any visitation if he wanted. I had him blocked everywhere for a month. \n\nThe same day, I reactivated my Facebook and announced the birth of my son with his full name. \n\nMy husband called me up crying and furious, and told me that I had  no right to name HIS son after \" some dead guy I fucked \". His family thinks I'm the devil incarnate, and even my mom thinks I went too far. \n\nI'm losing my mind here. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n*******\n\n\nTo the people wondering, I'm not going to deny my husband a relationship with his son. We'll come to a custody or visitation plan once we get a court order. For now, he is free to visit his son whenever he wants. The rest would be his choice.\n\n\n**********\n\n\nTo people asking me if It was his choice to go no contact and whether he tried to contact or find me. No it wasn't his choice and he DID try to find me, but he was informed that I was safe and that I would reach out to him once I was ready. \n\nWhy did I stay away from him and didn't tell him about the baby for one month? \n\nMy emotions were a wreck and I didn't want to see him or talk to him. I was incredibly toxic to be around, going through hell mentally ,emotionally and physically. I didn't want anything to do with him. I also wanted the first month of my son's life to be a peaceful bonding experience for me and my son.\n\nWas it for my mental health? Yes. \n\nWas it selfish? Yes.\n\n************\n\nTo remind everyone, Daniel isn't just my dead ex, my former boyfriend, my old lover, my ex boyfriend. \n\nHis memory is the reason I pushed myself to eat healthy and be ALIVE to survive my pregnancy and give birth to my son. He is my spirit angel looking after me from heaven, and that's why I named my son after him. He was taken from me by fate, but he will always be there looking out for me and my baby. \n\n\n**edited**",

Your ex can still be a father, if he wants, but for things like names and immediate after-birth decisions, that's 100% yours to control.\n\nPlus his name tradition is stupid and sexist anyway because it treats you as an incubator, not a person, and the child like an extension of the parents, not an individual.

No one is even saying she needed to invite him into the hospital or say when she was in labor!\n\n\nDespite what her husband did, he is still the father of that child. Keeping the baby from him for an entire month is absolutely wrong. That is his kid too, even if he is a mega asshole for cheating.\n\nThe name thing as well, the father still deserved SOME input. It's totally fine if she refused to name the baby after him due to what happened, but he still deserved some choice. That is his kid too. He betrayed the relationship with OP, he didn't give up his rights as a parent.\n\nIn another comment OP says she doesn't plan on co-parenting but \"parallel parenting.\" I totally get OP is hurt. I've been cheated on. I am also a mother too. But that baby has two parents and OP cannot just decide that she rules everything involved with the child, and refusing to co-parent is only going to make that kid's life harder. OP has clearly already decided it's fine to weaponize this baby because she's hurt, and that's really not okay.",
