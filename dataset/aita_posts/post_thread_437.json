  "post content": "I had a major fight with my wife a few hours ago and I strongly think I\u2019m in the right but she is so angry I almost feel like I\u2019m the one crazy. I\u2019ll provide context. I married my wife 3 years ago but we have been together 6. One important thing to note is she\u2019s extremely clean. I regret not moving in together until we married because while I knew she was clean I didn\u2019t know the full extent. Let this be a lesson to live with your partner before marriage. She is the reason why our house looks like a model home. She hates dishes in the sink while I\u2019m content to let them sit for a couple days. She spends her off days scrubbing bathrooms because in her mind they should be cleaned weekly. She doesn\u2019t let me bring my shoes inside and insists I shower immediately when I get home before laying in bed. There are a million more things but hopefully you have an idea. \n\nThis didn\u2019t start hurting our marriage until we had kids. We have a 2 year old and a 1 year old. I\u2019m a SAHD. I left work when our youngest was born and that is when our disagreement on how clean the home needs to be started to get bad. She expects me to do most of the chores now when it used to be primarily her and I wouldn\u2019t mind if they were reasonable. She wants the children to have a bath everyday and I think every 1-3 days is fine. She wants all of their toys put away by the end of the day and I think there is no point when it will be a mess again. She wants the dishes done daily. She wants all house bedding washed weekly. She wants me to vacuum weekly. She wants me to mop every 3-4 days since in her logic the kids spend a lot of time playing on the floor. They will not be hurt or sick if I mop every 2 weeks. Because I don\u2019t play along with most of her demands she ends up being the one to do most of the housework when she gets home or her rare off days.\n\nShe works 40-80 hours/week so it is a lot but she does it to herself. I feel I do what is reasonable. This all built up to today. She got home and saw I hadn\u2019t yet washed the dishes and there was still grease/food in some of the pans and on the countertop. Also I hadn\u2019t yet brought in the trash cans from the previous two days when they were emptied. She flew off the handle calling me lazy and a slob. She said she would like for me to return to work since in her eyes I\u2019m doing a poor job and use the money to hire a weekly housekeeper and a nanny who \u201cwouldn\u2019t leave the kids in pjs all day.\u201d I got pissed and told her she is crazy and she works herself up over small things and I will not be leaving my kids with a stranger. She packed a bag for herself and our babies and to her mom\u2019s house. I\u2019m furious. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: so I\u2019m the asshole. The common belief is I need to help more around the house. I\u2019ll see what I can do and apologize to my wife. Thanks.",

Leaving bins at the road is not objectively \"unacceptable\", though I know many HoAs won't stand for it and I find it kind of \"trashy\" (pun not intended, but akin to having a car on your lawn lol).

I fall somewhere in between OP and his wife in terms of overall cleanliness so I can understand that not everything needs to stay museum level cleanly in order to be liveable. But when your refusal to do the bare minimum affects the rest of your neighbourhood on a regular basis, then yeah, you're an AH. I don't even live in an area where HOA's are a thing, but most cities have laws about not leaving your trashcan out. If he's getting fined for it, then he's double the AH for making the wife pay for his laziness. \n\nThere's got to be a middle ground to this. Under no circumstances does working outside the house make the wife exempt from cleaning, and I definitely don't think a SAHP should have to spend their whole day cleaning, but it sounds like his standards are non-existent. I'd like to know how he's spending his day. Is he actively parenting, or is he playing games all day while the kids destroy the house?",

Check out Montessori early child learning videos, because you need to incorporate these duties into the regular rhythm of your day and involve the kids. \n\nA 2 year old can help wipe the table off. A one year old can throw clothes with you into the washing machine (and be fascinated by water and bubbles). Clean sheet day means we build a fort in the morning with the linens and then start washing before lunch. Weekly FORT DAY are you kidding me? You'd be dad of the year. Floor needs mopping? Cool. Give them soapy sponges while you sweep the rest and throw them straight into the bath. Call it double bubble time, idk. Put in the effort into excelling at this crucial precious time in their development and work together as a family--you will thank yourself when they're teenagers.\n\nhttps://www.themontessorinotebook.com/age-appropriate-chores-for-children/\n\nCheck out the \"Fair Play\" game with your wife so you can both examine what the division of labor is now and see where the gaps and tensions can be addressed as a team.

My brain does not do that. My brain says \"dishes suck. I am starved of dopamine. Why the fuck would I want to do that when I can get dopamine on candy crush?\" And so we're paralyzed on the couch playing candy crush even though we feel all of the shame and guilt and anxiety about the pile of dishes we're staring at. And the shame and guilt makes it worse because it means we're making less dopamine so it's even harder to get up. \n\nSo I feel less shame about the paralysis because I understand now that I'm not being lazy, my brain won't let me move.\n\nI know some people don't like thinking about adhd as a disability, but it feels really freeing to me. Like there's a reason this feels really hard, because we are living life on hard mode. That doesn't mean that I don't still work to overcome it. If I give in and I'm late to work every day I *will* get fired, I *have to* fight to be on time so I can feed my family. But it means that I understand that getting to work on time is harder for me that my NT colleagues so I feel less shame about the struggle. \n\nAll that being said, when I had a big cleaning problem that I was crippled with shame about, I didnt go to my mom or grandma for help. I couldn't bear to admit to them that I was struggling this badly. I turned to my adhd support group. And that was within the last month. So I feel less shame than I did 15 years ago when I didn't understand my brain, but I still struggle",

Coming home to a dirty house with basic cleaning not done and young children still in the clothes they slept in, unbathed. I guarantee a mother/wife would catch huge shit for that. Plus, I feel so much better when I\u2019m clean and in a fresh set of sweats/shirt, even if I don\u2019t leave the house that day. Why wouldn\u2019t I do the same for my kid? She gets clean footie jammies every morning (since she\u2019s still a baby.) Some days it\u2019s okay, but I hate the feeling of sitting around in my pajamas all day.

Kids play outside and get dirty; it's very normal to clean yourself every day (and honestly obligatory for most adults IMO, even if not washing hair). He didn't clean dishes for the entire day; washing dishes after a meal has never taken me more than 10 mins unless I have to soak it. He doesn't clean the bedding regularly, vacuum regularly, pick up after his small children (which is part of childcare), or take in the trash cans, which takes all of a minute. None of the tasks his wife asks him to do that are mentioned here are arduous or excessively time-consuming. He even left the kids in their pajamas instead of putting them in clean clothes! What \"hard work\" is OP doing all day if he's not regularly cooking, cleaning, or taking care of children, which housewives have been expected to do since the concept of it began?",
