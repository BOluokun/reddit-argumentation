  "post content": "So I (26M) own my house and it has a in-ground pool. Since I live in a warm weather state, my friends love to come over. The past few months, my house has turned into a hangout spot among my friends. My best friend Tyler is dating Gwen. Gwen has a friend named Julie. We\u2019ve all known each other since freshman year of college. I\u2019ve always had a crush on Julie and we\u2019ve always been part of the same group. One night a few weeks ago I decided to just go for it and texted her to ask her out. She told me that she liked me as a friend. I told her I totally understood and thought that would be the end of it. \n\nWell the next pool day came. I typically send out giant group text to invite everyone. I decided to not invite Julie this time. But she showed up. Not even with Tyler or Jenn. She came with some of the other friends in our group. And it was just really awkward. She tried talking to me the WHOLE time. I\u2019d say something quickly and try to leave. She partnered with me for every drinking game. We have never spoken that much even before I asked her out. After she left that night I told Tyler/Gwen what happened. Gwen told me she already knew. I told them that I didn\u2019t really want her around anymore. Gwen said she would talk to Julie about it. Well this past Saturday I had another pool day. Similar thing, sent out the text, left Julie off of it. I invited a girl that I\u2019ve been talking to. Well Julie shows up again. But this time she spends the whole day talking to the new girl I brought. They became \u201cbesties\u201d. Julie even told the girl that I asked her out before. It was just incredibly awkward for me. \n\nSo this Sunday I texted Julie individually and told her that I didn\u2019t want her around anymore. And that she shouldn\u2019t come to the next get together as I felt uncomfortable. She didn\u2019t respond. But now people in the friend group are calling me an AH. Saying that I host most weekends so it\u2019s pretty harsh to put her out. AITA?",

He wanted to ban her from the instant he was turned down. I put weirdness in quotes because, while it\u2019s possible she was acting strange, he may have been throwing her behavior way out of proportion because *he* felt awkward. Honestly, she probably was s little extra friendly in an attempt to make it clear she wasn\u2019t bothered by him asking her out, and trying to get to relax a bit and move on. However, he sounds like he was hyper aware of any interactions with her since he felt awkward enough to not invite her. Her little bit of extra friendliness didn\u2019t feel friendly to him when what he really wanted was to avoid her. \n\nOP, I get it. Putting yourself out there to be rejected doesn\u2019t feel great, but Julie didn\u2019t do anything wrong. If you are going to take a chance on a person in your friend group, you have to live with the fact you may still need to interact with this person even when they turn you down. Yes, it\u2019s okay to be a little awkward at first but soon it\u2019ll be a distant memory and it will go back to normal. What you\u2019ve done by ban her from your home is to make it even more awkward for you. Now every last person in your group knows you were rejected by her. They also know your ego is fragile and if you don\u2019t think they are discussing this amongst themselves, you are wrong. If you had acted with even an iota of maturity this situation would have passed quietly and quickly. \n\nAlso, i\u2019d like to point out that there\u2019s a second reason she might have been extra friendly at the next party. She might have been reconsidering her answer. She may have given you a knee jerk response when she said no, but after some consideration thought it could be worth a shot. Her extra attention might have been her trying to get to know you better, or her way of trying to let you know that she had a change of heart. Regardless, even if this is what was happening, banning her from your home because she rejected you certainly reinforced her first answer was the correct one.",

They've been hanging out consistently for 8 years and they are whole-ass adults. This is almost certainly Julie's primary friend group, which OP is now trying to take from her because he feels awkward at her not reciprocating his feelings. Obviously she is going to do whatever she needs to to ingratiate herself to him as a platonic friend, because he currently holds the power to eliminate her entire primary social circle against her will, during a stage in life when that circle is not easily replaced.\n\nThere is no way Julie can possibly be an AH for being a bit clumsy while trying to prevent someone from unilaterally razing her social life. It's pure YTA for OP to so casually disregard the implications of what he is doing, all because his ego was bruised by what was, based on OP's own telling, a considerately-delivered rejection. He's 26, not 14. Being rejected by a crush should not be an offense worthy of ostracism at his age.

If she didn\u2019t, maybe she was just trying to make a new person in the group feel welcome. How do we know that isn\u2019t how Julie always is with new people? Maybe she thought she was just getting New Girl up to speed on everything so she doesn\u2019t feel left out in a conversation because she doesn\u2019t know the context?\n\nAnd we also don\u2019t know the context of the conversation in which Julie says this. What if it was a response to New Girl asking why OP was being super weird around Julie?",
