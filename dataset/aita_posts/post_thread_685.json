  "post content": "Several years ago, I purchased for my sister a very expensive dog to comfort her during her battle with cancer. Sadly, her cancer became terminal about two months ago and she died last week. Last month she went into hospice care and my brother went over to her house and took the dog. At the time, this seemed ok because someone had to look after it temporarily, but now he's planning on keeping the dog. Here is the issue: my sister's daughter, now an orphan, wants the dog and I agree she should have it. I don't think my sister would have ever let him take the dog if he'd told her he was going to keep it and I'm certain she would want her daughter to have the dog. My niece did not initially take the dog because she lives several states away in an apartment but in a few months she will be living in a house. I think the best thing for both the dog and my niece is for my niece to have the dog when she gets a house. She is a responsible girl and the dog is one of her last things on this earth that she has to remember her mom by. My brother has been like some kind of Disney villain - taunting my niece and telling her he'll never give it back and it loves him the most now. He was not even very close or nice to our sister, even as she was dying of cancer and I now realize taking the dog in the first place wasn't any kind of generosity to help a dying woman - it was an opportunistic dog-napping. Frankly, I am disgusted by his heartlessness. Anyways, at the funeral, I was eulogizing my sister and complimenting our other family members on their kindness to each other and my sister but when it came to mentioning my brother I just looked at him and the only non-profane words I could muster to describe him were \"my brother, the dog thief.\" Thankfully, everyone laughed and it brought a brief smile to my niece. I've talked to some friends and they are divided on who should get the dog so now I'm reflecting on the situation and wondering AITA for calling my brother a dog thief at my sisters funeral.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: To those offering their condolences: thank you, that is very appreciated (even if you also concluded I suck ha). My sister had a big personality and a flair for the dramatic. She would have loved to see the outpouring of support for her daughter and it wouldn't have been an event in her honor without a little bit of drama and some brotherly jabs. Her daughter and her dog were her whole world and she would've raised hell against our brother for this.  \n\nTo those suggesting we seek legal guidance: Thank you for your concern. Fortunately, the law is pretty clear in my niece's state. The dog is legally hers, so we're dealing with more of a practicality issue than legal one. \n\nTo those requesting an update: the dog is currently still with my brother, and probably will be for at least another few weeks until my niece can reclaim it. I will try to update then. \n\nPlease do not criticize her for being unable to take the dog right now. If she could, she absolutely would and she is making arrangements as quickly as possible. She's had a lot going on and there is no way she could have better prepared for this situation. \n\nTo those doubting this is real or the full story: I just have to chuckle and be glad not everyone's family is polluted with toxic sadists. I obviously tried to include all the important details while preserving some privacy and brevity, but it's accurate. ",
