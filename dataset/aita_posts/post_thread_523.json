  "post content": "My ex (M 39) and I (F 43) had been together for 9yrs. We have 2 children (7 & 5) and have lived together for a little over 7yrs. 4 yrs ago I bought a house and it is in my name only. He was bitter and upset about it, but we were not married and his credit was not good enough to be on the loan. So everything with the house is in my name. I was married before and have absolutely no desire to get married again. We had been having issues in our relationship for about a 1yr and everything came to a head right around Thanksgiving 2022 and after a brief separation (\\~2wks) I could tell nothing was going to get resolved and told him I was ending the relationship. He still wants to work on the relationship & is still trying to convince me to get back together. I have told him No repeatedly & he needs to make plans to get his things. There is a shed in the backyard I told him I would store his things & he could come to pick them up once he got a place & got them settled.\n\nNow about the fish, about 2yrs ago he built a pond in the backyard and a neighbor gave him 17 fairly large Koi fish. These are not fish someone can put in a fish tank and keep inside and he has added more fish over the last couple yrs. There are still 15 large Koi and bunch of smaller fish. The pond has required a lot of upkeep and maintenance that he mostly took care of. I would help feed the fish occasionally, but for the most part, I wanted nothing to do with it. Now that we are split up and I have asked him several times what the plan for the fish & his things is & he never gives me an answer. He just keeps saying he wants to get back together. This is not going to happen & I have made that clear to him.\n\nWell, it's starting to warm up here and I can tell the pump needs to be fixed again bc it is barely moving any water and the pond water is turning green already. I have been feeding the fish every few days, but that is the extent of my knowledge of caring for the fish and the pond. I do not have the time or money to figure out what needs to be done, so I found a fish/pond guy in our area and told my ex the guy was coming to look at the fish in the next 2 wks & he was probably going to take the fish & I would fill in the hole for the pond. He flipped out & said he wanted the fish & that I can't just get rid of his things. It has been over 45 days since we split and he has made absolutely no plans to pick up any of things or told me any plans for the fish.\n\nSo I told my ex he has until the fish/pond guy comes to get the fish, otherwise, I'm going to let him take them. He is LIVID & saying I can't expect him to find something to do with all these fish in a rental. He's saying I'm heartless and all the stuffs, but I really don't want to let these fish suffer bc of my lack of knowledge/experience/money/time/etc. I told him I don't want to deal with the pond/fish upkeep/maintenance and if hasn't picked them up before the other guy comes, he can have them.\n\nWIBTA for letting the fish/pond guy take the fish?",
