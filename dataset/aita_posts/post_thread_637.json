Anyone who works in the construction business knows that you have to have thick skin. You can't let little shit get to you, people talk shit all the time, you either have to talk shit back, or suck it up.\n\nI don't know what his problem was today but he just wouldn't let it go. He talked about my dick for about 5 hours. I figured if it was on his mind that much he wanted to see it. I sent him one of my favorite ones that I send my wife all the time.\n\nHe was not amused and he called me an asshole. I just wanted to get your guys's opinion.\n\nEdit: For everybody saying I should have went to HR, you don't snitch in my line of work. Unless somebody's behavior is risking a personal injury. \n\nSome people suck, but even shity people have families to feed.",
