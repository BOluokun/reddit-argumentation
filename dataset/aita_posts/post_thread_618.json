  "post content": "I am the father of a one year old toddler. Recently, she started teething, as her molars have started to come in. First, it was the top ones for about a week, then we had a week\u2019s break, and now the bottom ones are coming in. It\u2019s clearly causing my daughter a lot of pain, especially at night. Before she was a good sleeper, but now it\u2019s been rough. She\u2019s been waking up around 1am and then 3am daily, screaming with her little fingers in her mouth. My wife and I have tried comforting her, bringing her in our bed (she sleeps in our room anyway and her crib is next to our bed, but normally she likes to sleep cuddled up when she\u2019s uncomfortable), we\u2019ve even given her baby Motrin to help with the pain but she still screams for about 10-20 minutes each time until we are able to settle her. It\u2019s shrill and it sucks, but there\u2019s not much we can do beyond what we are already doing. \n\nWe live on the ground floor of a new condo building. It\u2019s made of heavy concrete and decently sound proofed, but not perfect. Above us lives a single woman in her late 20s / early 30s. This is an expensive part of town in a new building, so we can assume shes decently monied. She also keeps her balcony door open all day and night that faces into our courtyard. She has been \u201cpunishing\u201d us during the day by blasting loud music directly into our unit by putting a stereo next to her balcony. We are on the ground floor and have a fully enclosed courtyard so it vibrates around. She\u2019s got great music taste, and my daughter will dance to it all day long. So while my wife hates her intention, I think it\u2019s worked out just fine\u2026 until now\u2026 \n\nLast night she came barging down at 3am and rang our bell 4 times while we were trying to settle our daughter. Motrin works for about 8 hours, so by 3am we have to give her another dose and wait through the cries, cradling her for 15-20 minutes for it to kick in again. My wife (a strong tempered petite woman, amplified by her first year of motherhood) wanted to go fight her then and there, but I said let\u2019s just concentrate on settling the baby and ignore her. I also didn\u2019t want to make the baby any more upset than she already was. So yeh, I just let her fume outside my door at 3am. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I delivered a small care package to her door with a long letter and a bottle of wine and chocolates. She was not home so I put it next to the door. We are only here for a couple months (temp rental until we finish construction) but I\u2019d rather offer an olive branch than see all the pettiness continue. Yes, it sucks to be woken up. Yes, it\u2019s a shared building. Yes, people throw parties here until 3am on the weekends. Yes, babies cry and we try our best. For those who live in very big cities\u2014 mine has 22 million\u2014 this is what you experience. I\u2019m listening to loud mariachi music from the neighbour across the way right now. ",

Her response with the loud music is childish.\n\nIs there some reason why you can't move the doses of Motrin so that it works all night? Maybe a dose at 11:00 pm? That would allow all of you to get a much needed night's sleep. Also, I think they make cold teething rings to help with pain. \n\nTry harder...for you, your child, and you neighbor.",

That's not even including just individual personality stuff.\n\nI have twins. They each had their own things they'd scream about as babies. One was very clingy and would cry if not held enough or he was left alone for 10 seconds. The other was very chill, he very much enjoyed being held and cuddled but was also fine not to be and wouldn't cry or coming crawling after if you left the room to go pee or something. However, he did have a very low threshold for pain tolerance, so any head bump or accidental scratch or whatever had him scream-crying. When he got his his first vaccinations, I had to hold him and comfort him for 10 minutes as he scream-cried, calmed down, then scream-cried again, meanwhile his brother had calmed down within 20 seconds of his own vaccination.",

I have no clue how many kids they actually have but more than 3, I am not social person and I avoid all social contacts as much as possible. But the kids do go through periods of crying at night. And little bit older they get temper tantrums in the morning and then they really scream, only teenagers getting a fit is louder, but that happens like maybe once a year, could be more soon the second oldest is probably approaching 13-14. He is at least as tall as I am already (I am 5'2)\n\nMy solution is good noise cancelling headphones, paired with white noise and earplugs. Works great for me and I have not been bothered unless the headphones run out of battery.  \n\n\nEDIT: To OP I would say NTA the woman could search ways to minimize the noise to her as babies do not have volume control. They cry when they need something.  I would choose live under family with small children over renovation enthusiast any day. That noise is unbearable. I would also not want to live under party house because with drunk people the problems rarely stop at just being loud.",

OP should be looking at trying to get better meds or time them better not just for the sake of his neighbours, but for his kid.

I'd also suggest it may be to down out any screaming during these times...  And if it's during the day/at a reasonable hour, OP has no right to complain, really unless we're talking volume that is unreasonable at any hour.  Like wall shaking or something.\n\nHonestly, OP comes off as sexist and petty. Maybe even jealous that she isn't dealing with a kid.

It is not unreasonable to expect the barest amount of consideration from parents and I won\u2019t pretend it is.
