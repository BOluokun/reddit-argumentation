  "post content": "My 9yo son needed hip bone osteoma surgery and his mom and I scheduled it before his three week winter break. My ex and I share 50/50 but I get him on winter breaks so she could take him our of state to see her family in the summer.\n\nThe day before the surgery she asked me if Ry could stay at her place to recover from the surgery. I asked her why and all she said was that she just wanted to be there. I said no. Ry has never had surgery and it's a big deal for him. I don't want him to think that the first thing you when you face something scary is run to your mom and not your dad.\n\nI told her I was quite insulted by her request. Plus he was going to need help getting dressed, undressed and bathed for the first couple of days and I highly doubt that he'd be comfortable having his mom do that. She said her husband could do that.\n\nI told her no. He's having the surgery and I'm taking him to my house when he's released. I don't care if she's in the operating room. \n\nShe then asked if she could see him at my place and I said no. The agreement is that we have scheduled FaceTime with him when he's at the other parent's house. I don't want my ex wife in my home anymore than she wants me in hers. If the shoe was on the other foot then I'd understand whether I liked it or not. \n\nI held firm and things have been tense between us ever since. Personally I don't care because I'm not apologizing for not giving her what she wanted.\n\nEdit: No, my son doesn't get to decide who he gets to stay with and when and for how long. That's why there are custody agreements.",

If you have the time and means to take care of him while he recovers, that's not a problem. \n\nBut have you asked your son where HE prefers to stay during this time? A lot of kids prefer their mother when they are sick or hurt. That has nothing to do with how good a parent you are, that's just how it is. And if he is happy enough to stay with you, have you considered he might want or even need to also see his mum? \n\nNowhere in your post do you consider your son's needs and wishes, only your own. Can you not for 3 weeks set your on ego aside in the interest of your kid? Can you not arrange he stays with you, and set a few days and times where his mum can come over while you go do the shopping or whatever? If you don't want her alone in your home can you not ask a friend of family member to be in the house in a different room during that time?\n\nIf you don't care about your ex wife's feelings that's fine. But you are hurting you son if you don't take what HE wants into account. So ask yourself: is making your stand and your ego more important than the wellbeing of your son?",
