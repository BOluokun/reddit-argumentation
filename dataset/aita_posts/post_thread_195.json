  "post content": "I have an older brother who ive been estranged with for a long time. Not even sure where/if he lives at this point. Don't really care. Apparently when he was in his mid 20s he sold some sperm to a clinic for easy cash. We know this because his spawn \"Jake\"23M recently tracked my family down after taking one of those DNA tests. He was unable to contact my brother (no shock there) but found me on LinkedIn, reached out and we met for lunch. Based on his messages originally I thought my brother knocked someone up and abandoned her, but at lunch I found out he was conceived using donor sperm of my brother's. He does look a lot like my brother did when we were younger but based on his origination, I dont really feel any sort of familial bond if Im being honest. I have my own family that I care about deeply and I really dont need much more.\n\nI guess Jake is feeling somewhat of an identity crisis from not knowing where he came from so he wanted to meet. When I met with him I told him I would though I feel weird about it. I did feel like I should at least meet him to share the very limited info I know about family medical history (luckily we're pretty healthy but I have had some extended relatives diagnosed with cancer in the last few years). So I told him that but it was clear he wanted more. He asked about my weekend plans and I told him I was on Easter duty and hosting an event with friends and family. He asked if he could come, meet my kids, and some other relatives. I told him, sorry but thats too weird. I have no ethical qualms with sperm donation, IVF, or any of that but I feel like it makes a difference that he was \"created\" that way. So I told him no and that I dont want to pursue another meeting with him.\n\nHe seemed upset but left with no incident. Then lately he's reached out again telling me that Im treating him like shit when we are technically family. I told him no again, he wouldn't stop pushing so I told him I dont consider him family whatsoever, that I was blocking him, and if he reached out again I would speak to my attorney about a restraining order. My wife thinks I was too harsh to say those words but agrees we shoudln't maintain contact, it'd be weird to have him meet our kids given the situation. My friend however says im being kind of an A-hole because Jake is \"clearly having an identity crisis\" and Im in a position to help. I have mixed feelings on that.",

It's easy for people who aren't donor-conceived to wax poetic about how the recipients are the \"real\" parents, DNA means nothing, blah blah blah. Meanwhile these children conceived via egg and sperm (or embryo) donation are growing up being lied to for much of their lives, wondering why they don't really seem to fit in with their family, getting a nasty shock when they finally learn the truth about where half (or all) of their genetics come from, and then having the door slammed in their face because the anonymous donor wants nothing to do with them. The donor's anonymity was agreed on in the contract between the donor and the recipients, where the donor benefited by getting money and the recipients benefited by getting a baby. What does the child get? They weren't present when those agreements were made and they're not obligated to follow them. Seeking out their biological family doesn't make them an asshole, and they should have the right to know the donor's identity. Anonymous donation is very much a thing of the past and in my opinion (and that of practically all of the donor-conceived adults I've spoken to), that's a great thing.",
