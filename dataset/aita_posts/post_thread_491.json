  "post content": "Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm using a throwaway account because my username is one I use on different platforms.\n\nI know this sounds like a really weird question but it is honestly keeping me up. I'm a college student and I moved into a different, on-campus apartment this year. Everything's going really well but this one thing came up earlier. Our shared toilet doesn't entirely flush, but it's only just strands of paper come back up and nothing else. (Nothing else is being thrown in). I was talking to some of my roommates and the toilet was brought up. They mentioned how it's an \"older toilet\" (but the building was built in the 80s) and doesn't flush toilet paper well, so they all throw their used toilet paper into the bin. To my knowledge, half of my roommates already do this and I haven't asked/heard from the others. This might just be a culture thing for me or something I just have never heard of before but I find this pretty gross.\n\nI feel like the toilet should be working fine- I lived in a different building last year that was built around the same time as my current one and this was never an issue. But I have been told that this is an older building but I can't find anything on it. The campus also has maintenance people we can call and I feel like ringing them up would fix the issue. I'm mainly worried because we cycle out who throws out the trash cans and I don't really don't want to throw out other peoples used paper and today is the first day the can has really smelled, but I've only been here two weeks. Also, we're still in a panini so there's that too. I'm mainly worried if I would be the a-hole to be the one clogging the toilet or disagreeing with what my roommates think is best. They seem pretty set on just throwing them in the bin. WIBTA to continue flushing my toilet paper?",
