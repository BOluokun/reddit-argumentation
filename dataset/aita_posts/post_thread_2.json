  "post content": "I've worked at my office for 8 years. I'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.\n\u200b\n\nFive months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.\n\n\u200b\n\nSupervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said \"This is John\" and described my job.\n\n\u200b\n\nTed: \"Hi, Jack.\"\n\nMe: \"It's John.\"\n\n\u200b\nTed: \"What?\"\n\u200b\n\nMe: \"My name's John, not Jack.\"\n\nTed: \"It's close enough for me.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nThis continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him \"You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nHis response was \"Sure thing, Jackie boy.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nSince I don't work directly with him, I figured \"screw it\" and that I'd ignore him.\n\n\u200b\n\nRecently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says \"Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!\"\n\n\u200b\n\n(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)\n\n\u200b\n\nAs promised, I ignored him.\n\n\u200b\n\n7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.\n\nThe first one was along the lines of \"Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.\"\n\nE-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.\n\n\u200b\n\nI signed out and went home. It was raining hard.\n\nNext morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams \"Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!\" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.\n\n\u200b\n\nSupervisor: \"Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nI relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.\n\nSupervisor: \"I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt.\" he sighed and said \"With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nA few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.\n\n\u200b\n\n*AM* I the a-hole on this?",

If they don't pay attention, I will start ignoring them.\n\nYou warned him what would happen. You were very clear. Your supervisor also expressed to him that he needed to call you by the right name. He really can't say he didn't know what was going to happen. It was a little dickish to leave him, but hey, it was just as dickish of him to use the wrong name ON PURPOSE, after you told him not to.",

Hopefully with added safety measures/channels if people do not.\n\nFor example the business trip that gets ruined could cost the company as a whole a bunch, which if only one finger could be raised could be pointed at the harasser, but the retaliation also factors in making it worse. I think that is what the superior is trying to point out.\n\nIt managed to work out fine like this this time, but if a similar situation occurs, it would be preferred not to retaliate in this fashion, but to notify superiors of the strain the employee is putting on cooperation. If OP would mention it to his colleges and spread the idea the way to handle situations like that is through retaliation, it could hurt in the long run. If people who think they're justified to retaliate but many others disagree for example or someone actually gets hurt in the retaliation.\n\nI guess you could see it as covering their ass, but you could also see it as taking responsibility (or covering everyone's ass).

The Lyft driver wouldn't let me in the car because he didn't want to get blood on the seats. He said Lyft would pay to get it cleaned and charge me but there's a ton of paperwork and he wouldn't be able to drive until after he got it cleaned so that's money out of his pocket.
