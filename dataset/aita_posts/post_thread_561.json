It just felt fair to let you know since I know you've had a crush on her.\" \n\nOne of my friends came to me in high school saying that a guy I had a crush on asked her out, and she liked him too, but didn't want it to come between our friendship. I was bummed but supportive of her going for it. Not everyone handles it the same way and I know that's best case scenario. But I was glad she let me know.",

You\u2019re probably NTA to ask her out.\n\nHowever, depending on how much you value your friendship you should ask permission first",

Ask permission first if you want to avoid issues with your friend. However, If you choose to ask permission and he says no you need to respect that",
