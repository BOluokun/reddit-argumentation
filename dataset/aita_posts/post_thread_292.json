Our culture dictates that Peggy\u2019s father and I share the costs for their wedding. He (her father) said we should provide $10k each, a total $20k budget. I could afford this sure but This seems insane and extravagant to me. I said I would give $5k and he could give whatever he wanted. Peggy\u2019s father also put up 5k.\n\nI told my son this and he told me outright it wasn\u2019t going to be enough. He said \u201cI don\u2019t mind, I figured that me and Peggy would have to pay for some of the wedding\u201d. I asked what he meant. He said no way would they be able to do their wedding in under $10k. I said My own wedding, after haggling and deals, only came out to around $7k so I do not think this is an issue. He argued against me and said that my wedding was 40 years ago and prices were different. He outlined some prices and said the cheapest venue he could find was $5k, and food alone was going to be $2,5k.\n\nHe again said he didn\u2019t mind and he thanked me for giving them money for the wedding but I honestly felt hurt that he thought we were not giving enough. I said how could food come out to 2500 dollars and he said that that was only around $25 per person. I suggested ordering pizzas or sub sandwiches but he looked at me like I was crazy. I said okay well we can just offer less for the photographer and decorator and he said that isn\u2019t how things are done. I said it is how things are done, and maybe if Peggy and him weren\u2019t so spoiled and expecting the best of the best for everything then $10k would be plenty.\n\nAfter I said this he just closed his eyes and thanked me for the money and basically told me to get out. I was complaining about this instance to my wife and she told me I was being a stick in the mud and it\u2019s his only wedding. My friends agree with me though. AITA?",

They just can't imagine that prices have dramatically increased and they expect young people to be able to do what they did decades ago. My parents bought land and built a house for $90k in the 90s.

Their neighbour was also a butterfly (I want to say keeper?) who did a monarch release with everyone at the end of the ceremony as his wedding gift to them.\n\nMy parents provided the wine (they had a friend with a make-your-own wine place who gave them a deal and they printed off lovely custom labels). \n\nMy uncle hosted a stag and doe that raised several thousand dollars to help make some repairs to the house before the wedding, especially their large porch, as we'd need that more if it rained on the day. I was unemployed and out of school so I moved in with them to help with the repairs, cleaning, gardening, and decorating (they paid me a decent wage). My and my SIL's parents also came every weekend to help out with that. With the exception of the decorations (that weren't simply garden transplants that would be staying after).\n\nFor the rehearsal dinner, they bought all the food and I prepped all the appetizers and cooked the dinner (I had kitchen management experience, so that and doing some appetizers for the wedding itself was my gift to them - they paid for all the food). A lot of the gifts to the wedding party were made by my brother and his wife rather than purchased (his wife gave me a beautiful afghan she'd made for me), all the wedding swag stuff (like MoG hat, etc) was created and paid for by my SIL's parents.\n\nThe wedding party paid for their own tuxedo rentals and bridesmaid dresses (they weren't too expensive).\n\nI'm pretty sure my mom covered hair and makeup for my SIL and the bridesmaids.\n\nThe wedding party all had brunch the day of the wedding and the next day at nearby restaurants, which my brother and his wife covered. All the parents and the entire wedding party also stayed at their house for 7-3 days before the wedding, and the night of the wedding... so a bunch more food, etc, on top of what was needed for the wedding itself.\n\n***None of the above was considered part of the $6K wedding \"budget\"***.\n\nThe actual expenses for the wedding that made it only $6K were:  \n1 second-chance wedding dress (about 1/3 the cost of retail)\n\n1 Tuxedo rental\n\n1 tent\n\n2 wedding rings\n\n1 bouquet and some corsages for the wedding party\n\nCentrepieces (which were glass bowls filled with cool stones and a few other things, we got them all at the dollar store :D )\n\nWedding invitations (which where a little cheaper because I hand did the custom parts with the same style of calligraphy)\n\n1 sound system (I think they rented part of it, but they may have borrowed all of it)\n\n1 wedding officiant\n\n1 photographer\n\n1 bartender\n\nBeer and hard liquor (my parents had the wine covered)\n\nThe cost of the food for the wedding day appetizers I made\n\nCatering of the rest of the appetizers and the dinner, including 3 servers, plus table and chair rentals, silverware, glassware, linens, etc... my brother and his wife did provide a number of the tables and linens, but a large portion had to be rented.\n\n1 wedding cake",

( which is kind of pathetic now that I think about it. My father-in-law paid for the rehearsal dinner. Cheap f***. ) My parents gave me 10k almost 30 yrs ago.  And although it worked out fine, and we spent every cent, the reception etc. was very simple. I was very simple. Lol it was '95. I paid $100 for my wedding dress at Lord & Taylor in Boston! And was happy with it. Can u imagine? And my engagement ring was my great aunt's. We made our own \"goodies bags\" LOL I can't remember what they're called at a wedding. Lol u know what I mean.  \nSorry Dad, but you've embarrassed yourself. Pizza... come on now.",
