  "post content": "I (24,f) moved to another state with my family right before the start of my senior year of high school after living in Chicago for 10 years (2005 - 2015, technically 10 yrs and 3 months). I was constantly sick due to the cold weather and my mom thought it was best to move back to where I was born which was California. After moving back I rarely got sick like I did while living in Chicago however I was also in a committed relationship too (23, m). We've been together for 10 years now and he wants me to move back to Chicago to move in with him. He says that i wouldn't have to wait for the bus and that he can pick me up and drop me off at work to prevent me from getting sick even though I tell him it is the cold weather and that if I go back it will not end well. I've already discussed me going back with my doctors at least health wise and they have all recommended that I shouldn't go back due to my extensive medical history. When I try to convince him to move out to Cali he always makes the excuse of it being too expensive and that it would be cheaper and the smartest option to live in Chicago. I'm starting to feel like there isn't a compromise here but I love him. \n\nAm I the A-hole?",

If he shoots down a compromise then obviously he\u2019s.. well, he\u2019d be uncompromising.
