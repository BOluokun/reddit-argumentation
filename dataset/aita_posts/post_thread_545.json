  "post content": "Okay for context, I\u2019m 15 almost 16F dating my bf 16 almost 17M for around 8 months now. We\u2019ve been friends for years before we started dating. We\u2019re both Mexican but I was born and raised in Mexico before I moved to the United States while he\u2019s a third generation immigrant so I speak Spanish and was raised with the culture while he was raised in America with Mexican family. Growing up I\u2019ve always been a very affectionate person. I love to hug people I\u2019m close to, and in Mexico and Spain, it\u2019s a custom to kiss on the cheek as a greeting. As a culture we tend to be pretty touchy people in general and especially in my family I was raised as physical touch as the primary love language. So here\u2019s where I think I may be the ass hole. Prior to me dating my current boyfriend, I\u2019ve always been really touchy with my friends. Hugs, cuddles, forehead kisses, etc etc. So when we started dating, I honestly didn\u2019t think anything of it especially because I\u2019ve always been this way in front of him with other friends prior to us dating (while I had another boyfriend). And I\u2019m only this way around my girl friends and it\u2019s never meant anything to me except a platonic way of me showing my love to the people I\u2019m close to. A few months back I hung out with some friends without my boyfriend and recently he let me know the way that I was touchy with my friend made him upset. I hadn\u2019t even considered how this could\u2019ve made him upset because it\u2019s always been something that\u2019s so normal to me and I know this sort of thing varies from culture to culture. I never intended to hurt him and I explained that to him and he was deeply understanding and told me it would just take him time to get used to it.  Up until that point we\u2019d mainly just hung around each other so we\u2019d never been on that situation before which is why it came up. But I\u2019m starting to think I may be the ass hole because I struggle so much to give that form of affection up with my friends. And It\u2019s never anything that I haven\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t have done with my close family members so am I the ass hole?\n\n(He knows I\u2019m posting this btw)\n\nUPDATE: Me and my boyfriend talked about things and turns out the issue DOESNT have much with me being touchy at all. It was more specific to the person from the specific instance. They used to have a thing and they had a bad falling out so he\u2019s been weary of her every since so his opinion toward her isn\u2019t the most favorable and he said it spiked unreasonable jealousy in him. He\u2019s been super sweet and understanding about everything and we\u2019re working things through but yeah happy ending guys!",

Platonic intimacy is amazing!\n\nYour bf also clearly communicated his discomfort, and you responded as best you can. You\u2019re both openly communicating and that\u2019s the most important thing.\n\nMaybe if there\u2019s some sort of \u2014nonsexual\u2014romantic physical affection you could show w your bf, both in private and w friends, that would comfort him? Seeing some difference in your affection for your friends vs your affection for him may comfort him by reminding him that that truly is how you show platonic affection and that your feelings for him are unique. You could also talk w him about if he\u2019s uncomfortable w you expressing affection this way  in general or uncomfortable w witnessing it himself. Holding off when he\u2019s present would be a reasonable compromise.\n\nIf at the end of the day, he\u2019s uncomfortable w you being at all physical w your friends\u2026 this may wind up meaning that y\u2019all are just not compatible.\n\nThe most important thing is to keep communicating openly",

I am also somewhat a touchy person and also normal to me to kiss on the cheek as a greeting which is because im first generation so A lot of the Mexican norms and stuff are things I grew up with. There are some Mexican Americans that the more generations they are the more Americanized they are, depending if they try hard to maintain all or certain Mexican norms/traditions but it is inevitable that stuff slowly is erased out with each generation because they live in another country and exposed to another culture. I think he\u2019ll come around especially since you guys talked about it and said he was understanding. It\u2019ll take time but as long as you guys reach equal footing or are on the same page then you guys should be fine.",

If you feel like you want to change the way you act around friends, then go ahead, but don't feel pressured to do so. If he continues to have an issue with it, then you'll just need to have a discussion on your boundaries going forward if you want your relationship to succeed.",
