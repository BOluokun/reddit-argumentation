  "post content": "A friend decided she wanted to have her bachelorette party in Las Vegas, so most of the bridal party decided to road trip it out together, including the bride-to-be. We all chipped in so the bride wouldn\u2019t have to pay for her hotel room, bottle service at a club for one of the nights, and a nice dinner. We also chipped in to get her some gifts. The rest of the time, we all covered our own meals, gambling, etc. Everyone had a great time, bride included. \n\n\nA little backstory: Several of us met through work, which is a freelance industry. We are still semi-new to it, so it\u2019s always a grind to find our next job, and so none of us are exactly well-off. I even turned down a long gig, which really sucked for me financially, because it would have taken me out of the country for the date of the wedding. So on top of paying for my share of the bachelorette party, I also am paying for my wedding gift, a bridesmaid dress, two pairs of shoes she requested (wedding and rehearsal dinner), and a hotel room for the actual wedding which is also in another city a few hour away. So this wedding has already been fairly expensive for me. \n\n\nAnyway, as we are driving back home, we decide to just grab some fast food for lunch on the way. As I get to the front of the line, the bride runs up to me and tells me what she wants. I may have been a little cranky from the amount of money I just spent in Vegas, but I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I just looked at her, told her that sounded good, and paid only for my own order. Immediately, the bride\u2019s face turned angry, and things have been weird between us ever since. \n\n\nFor the record, I acknowledge that I absolutely could have afforded her $8 order, but it was her sense of entitlement that turned me off in the moment. But I still don\u2019t think I was in the wrong. AITA?",

She had money left over that the others didn't. I've been a bridesmaid (and a best (wo)man!) and once I'm shelling out over $1000 all in for a wedding + other events (travel, lodging, food, outfits, the bride/groom party), I've never had any left over for a present. My being in the wedding party (and planning a ton of stuff) was my present. [Miss Manners](https://emilypost.com/advice/wedding-attendants/) says I should have, but she also says that the bride/groom (or their families) should provide lodging for the wedding party, which has never happened for me. So, yeah, I'm gonna take that with a grain of salt.\n\nWedding invitations are not a binding contract to provide gifts. Gifts are \\*always\\* optional. I'm currently planning my own wedding and we're opting out of gifts all together, but yikes, even if we had a registry I can't imagine asking my bridesmaids to give something above and beyond what they already are doing.",
