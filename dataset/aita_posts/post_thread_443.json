  "post content": "I (F32) got a private text this morning from the mother of my son\u2019s (M7) classmate. She told me that apparently my son has been calling her daughter\u2019s traditional lunch weird and things as such and apparently that is making her daughter feel uncomfortable and insecure. She asked me to please talk to my son about being more sensitive and respectful so her daughter doesn\u2019t feel excluded.\n\nNow, I feel for this woman as a fellow mother. No one wants to see their child feeling sad, but overcoming insecurities is a big part of growing up. Additionally, I thought it was ridiculous of her to criticize my son, a 7 year old, for making relatively innocuous and curious comments about food that is not familiar to him. He\u2019s at a curious age and is discovering the world, and I refuse to try and limit him and shut him down for not having the emotional sensitivity of an adult.\n\nPolitely, I told that mother that I was sorry her daughter was struggling with insecurities, and I found some online parenting articles about building your child\u2019s confidence to send to her so she could use some tips to help her daughter out.\n\nShe replied and said I was acting completely shamelessly and disgracefully, and I am not able to text her anymore. AITA?",

This was 2000, I was very sheltered, and didn't know what gay actually meant, but I could tell from the way the word was used that it wasn't a desirable quality. She saw him and said something mean, and I did too- not because he was gay, but because he had been my \"boyfriend\" the year before, and he had dumped me out of nowhere. (I realize, now, that it had to do with his orientation, and that while I was hurt and felt rejected, we were both 11 years old and neither of us had the emotional capacity to deal with it like adults). \n\nI joined in and I deeply regret that now- especially as I had my own struggle with my orientation a bit later. (I'm bi). \n\nAgain, I really need to stress that yes, I bullied him and called him gay, but I really didn't know what it meant. But that doesn't matter, because the target of my bullying *thought* that I was attacking him based on that. So while I didn't fully understand what I was saying, the impact was the same. I will never stop feeling badly for how I hurt that boy, when he was probably just figuring out who he was. \n\nThe next day, his mom came to my dad's store he owned, and told him what happened, and asked him to deal with it. \n\nMy father was pretty progressive, considering the time period he was born into, and his religious beliefs, but he didn't support gay marriage at that time, believed it was a sin, but still had gay friends that he supported as friends and fellow humans. He never said a derogatory word to them about their sexuality, and certainly never used a slur. \n\nBut he was *furious* with me. I was grounded for a month, had to sit down and write an apology to the boy, and lectured endlessly about not being a mean little jerk. I wasn't allowed to go on a field trip that had been planned- the school hadn't barred me from going, but dad did. \n\nI never, ever picked on another kid like that again- because my dad, even if he had his own private feelings about homosexuality at the time, knew what was right, what was wrong, and taught it to me. \n\nThat's what good parents do. They teach their children to be better than them. \n\nEnd note: My dad did eventually come around, and became more accepting. I became an ordained minister in 2015 to perform a same sex marriage when their church wouldn't do it, and dad supported my choice to do so, and said he was proud of me for doing something I believed in.",

She'd just insert a negative opinion regardless of whether anyone had wanted to consult her or not over something. \"I'm just being honest.\" \"Isn't it better that I let you know?\" \"You should be happy that someone told you so you wouldn't feel embarrassed or bad\"\n\nI got all dressed up once only to be told not to wear strapless dresses or dresses with spaghetti straps because it highlighted how broad my shoulders were and that they didn't compliment them at all. I was feeling good in my chosen outfit and makeup up and that made me feel crud and insecure.\n\nI would sing and she would just tell me it sounded awful and \"it's okay here but it doesn't sound good at all, probably don't sing in front of others as you're way out and it just sounds dreadful\"\n\nWhich then became \"why are you doing that?\" -insert criticism or negative opinion.\n\nWhich then became \"why are you doing that?\" -> \"because I want to and blah blah blah ugh leave it alone\" snapped in a stressed and harsh tone.\n\nWhich then became \"my god I'm just trying to help you or give you advice Jesus no need for you to be so rude, you're so sensitive \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\"\n\n\n\nThere's a time and place for honesty. When asked an opinion and you feel negative in response you gently tell the person that you (personally) prefer X. Or something else gentle. No need to be blunt and just insert yourself when not asked.\n\nHer opinion on that is \"I'm letting you know what I think, I want to let you know so you don't go out like that etc etc I need to be able to be honest\"\n\nAlso if you can't change it or do anything about it for quite a while then it shouldn't be criticised. Telling me my makeup looks poorly done that day after spending all morning with me and then letting me know when we are in the shopping centre is awful.\n\nI see OP as exactly this, I see her son resulting in either a carbon copy of it to pass to his own next generation or an extremely anxious child who feels entitled but constantly afraid of criticism towards himself- even when he asks for opinions.\n\nOP do better yikes. He can be spoken to about how he could better approach the little girl (or others) if he finds something unusual. Massively beautiful learning moment could be had here.\n\n \"Hey 7y/o, I've been let know that you've been talking about ____ girls lunches, may I ask why you've been saying what you have?\" -establish his grounds for the communication to begin with, perhaps he was genuinely hoping to learn more about it and approached it wrong. That way you could advise him on a way to ask without referring to her food as weird and explain to him that other people calling someone's food odd can make them not enjoy their food as much.\n\nIf he was feeling grossed or icked by her food you could explain that other people have different preferences and she likely feels similar to some of his foods. The difference being is that he needs to think these thoughts and not voice them, perhaps even give the foods a go if he hasn't so that he knows whether they actually aren't pleasant to him or not. Then lastly whether he tries them and likes them or tries them and they make him dry-heave he should not show disgust or criticism to others for enjoying it as doing so is off-putting and makes it difficult for them to enjoy it.\n\nI always got told \"don't say yuck, you can think it or not but don't say it because it's off-putting and I still want to enjoy my dinner and if you're not eating it anyway then it doesn't matter.\"\n\nSo yes OP, YTA. The girls mother was just hoping that your kid would stop upsetting her daughters eating and that was entirely valid. I also got the sense that he didn't only do it once. This needs to be addressed by you. Her mother did not need to be sent that parenting article, she was not an issue here as her child was entirely appropriate with how she felt.",
