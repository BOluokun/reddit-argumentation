  "post content": "My husband and I have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. It took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. Our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. With that in mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal.\n\nSarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question.\n\nWe invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it.\n\nSarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. My parents think she is behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids.\n\nIt's really weighing on my mind and I honestly never expected this kind of outcome. She literally blocked us on every platform she could. Are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?",

That you had to prep her lavishly for the ask suggests you knew you were asking for something out of bounds. Your language suggests you barely respect her. Why were you even talking about this with her and your husband's parents and with your parents? And now you've damaged her relationship with others who shouldn't be involved, namely your parents.\n\nWait until she comes to you, and when she does, apologize sincerely and  profusely for not respecting her.",

Which is also why OP makes sure to write further down\n\n>plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it\n\nTrue surrogate mothers (i.e. women carrying another woman's child) have no expectations of parental responsibility anyway, because they're legally & biologically not the child's mother. That's why they're paid such a \"hefty sum\" as OP puts it. They're literally doing a job.\n\nThe only reason for OP to stress this would be if they were asking Sarah to conceive a biological child. \n\nBecause god forbid you adopt someone else's blood right OP? It's just not the same and you'd be taking on someone else's problem, right?\n\nEdit: People further down in the comments have mentioned that Sarah would not be qualified as a surrogate anyway. Surrogates have to have had at least one successful pregnancy. This convinces me more that they're asking Sarah for a biological child. Surrogates need one successful pregnancy to qualify, but any woman over 21 can walk into a fertility clinic and be artificially inseminated (with a NON RELATED sperm donor of course, since a few mouthbreathers here seem to be confused)",

It puts the person on the spot in such a guilt-tripping kind of way!

That way, if that's something the sister would have ever had any interest in then she could have approached them instead. If she didn't react at all, move on and look for someone else.",

What's up with all of the \"we're willing to pay as much as a normal surrogate\", \"she definitely doesnt have to help anything with childcare\". Dude. If she wants to she can just become a surrogate for other people. DEFINITELY, surely don't have to worry about later attachment/ childcare. Definitely get that amount of money.\n\nTo be clear, I don't have a problem with OP asking. It's the way it was done and  the aftermath. OP and her husband:\n- Ambushed Sarah (at the excuse of dinner)\n- Talked as if what they're offering is above and beyond. no it's not, its a given in any normal surrogacy.\n-Talked to Sarah's parents and OP's parents about this For what? Getting more people on her side? Hoping to change Sarah's mind? \n\nUgh if I were Sarah I would feel like my brother and SIL consider me as an incubator and mothing more. Wtf YTA OP.",

The lengths people go for children when nature says over and over it\u2019s not in the cards for them will never cease to astound me. \n\nYour sister in law was clearly anti children and you asked her to perform the most difficult phase of having children for your own child? I get that you can\u2019t get pregnant yourself but can you at least think about the emotional toll it would be to get pregnant with your brother\u2019s child, carry it to term, GO THROUGH BIRTH, and then no matter if your feelings change and transform the child YOU carried is then taken from you to be raised by your brother and sister in law. How can you not understand the weight of what you are asking?\n\nOh, but it means so much to your husband to have a blood relative carry it. What the actual fuck? If you have the money for a surrogate then hire a surrogate. Do you know what a surrogate is? A professional child incubator who has chosen that profession so people like you can try for a child at all costs. \n\nDespite me thinking you are incredibly selfish for trying to force a child genetically no matter that there are so many unwanted children in the world, I do believe you have a right to ask her. However that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have the right to be offended, grossed out, and angry that you would even ask. I understand that you are desperate for a child created from your and your husbands genetics and are probably blinded by your \u201cdesire\u201d but holy shit.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m quite fired up about this and I keep thinking of things. I hope this truly is a shit post.\n\nWhat if she miscarries? What if there\u2019s a developmental defect and you and your husband want to abort? First of all unless you did all of this legally you could potentially be forcing her down a difficult road. You don\u2019t know if the problem is your eggs and your husband\u2019s sperm. How many miscarriages could she suffer? His own sister! How would you handle it if you wanted to abort?
