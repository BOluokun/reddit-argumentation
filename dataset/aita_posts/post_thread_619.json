  "post content": "On my birthday this year, I treated myself to 50 bucks in lottery tickets, and managed to hit one of the huge $50,000 payouts. After taxes, I had ~$34,000, so I\u2019ve put $7,500 into my wife\u2019s car, and put the rest into a high-interest bank account. I\u2019m planning to switch jobs early 2020, but first, I plan to travel for the month of January and half of February across Asia and Europe. I\u2019ve never had a proper vacation (unless you count weekend trips to Disney World for the kids) and have really wanted to take the chance to go out there and explore the world.\n\nWell yesterday my daughter Emily were talking about the job movement and the topic of the vacation came up. I told her about how I\u2019m financing it with the lottery (she previously did not know about the winnings) and Emily went quiet before saying \u201cinstead of wasting 25 grand on a vacation, why not do something practical like maybe spend $5,000 on a vacation and help your daughter not graduate with mountain of debt\u201d.\n\nI told her that I\u2019d be happy to co-sign loans for her, but I was only willing to pay upwards of $10,000 of her education (the amount I promised both her and her brother when they were 13-15). She said even after paying that off, she\u2019s looking to be at being $29,000 in debt by the time she finishes school. \n\nI told her that really sucks, but reminded her that I offered community college as an option years ago when she was applying to schools, but she insisted that she didn\u2019t want to \u201cmiss out on the prestige\u201d (she got into Dartmouth). I talked to her about how transferring was an option, but she ultimately picked that route.\n\nShe\u2019s brought up how the 10k I gave Jason (my son) was enough to completely pay for college cost + some extra spending change, because he got a state scholarship that paid for 100% tuition. She argued how it\u2019s not fair that I was essentially willing to pay all of his college but leave her with a mountain of debt.\n\nI told her that he\u2019d be able to argue the same thing if she got more money than he did. Ultimately, the line I drew was that both children get equal amounts and I can choose how I want to spend my money, end of discussion.\n\nI thought it was over but it turns out that she went and talked to my wife Amy about it behind my back. Amy tried to \u201cpersuade\u201d me to make it a 2-3 week vacation as opposed to the 1.5 months I had planned. I told her the same thing that I told our daughter, and then SHE then got mad and said that I\u2019m being selfish and using all of the money that for myself (nevermind the amount I put into *her* car AND the fact that she used ALL of a $5,000 inheritance on cosmetic plastic surgery 4 years back). I told her this vacation was non-negotiable.\n\nNow I have two women in this household giving me passive aggressive looks and eyerolls. I feel like they\u2019re both acting entitled to MY shit; am I really being unreasonable here?\n\nEDIT I'm not leaving my wife behind; she can go for 10 days. She can't take the full 1.5 months off, though.",

I mean even for 1.5 months, 25 grand for a vacation is outrageous. Spending more is not going to make it better, and I think compromising with ~15 grand for the vacation is perfectly doable. \n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t think you should be obligated to spend that on tuition. In fact, I think it\u2019ll be unfair to your son. Put it to something for the family or maybe keep it stashed away for an emergency. But I think it\u2019s irresponsible to spend all of that on a single vacation. \n\nYou\u2019re not a single man. You have responsibilities and a duty to your family. You chose that life. You can\u2019t just run away from that when it\u2019s convenient for you.",

I did college late in life only because I had to. But I worked and went to school in the evenings and paid for it as I went. No grants, no loans so when I was done I was debt free.

So either, she has a work study and is working an on campus job, or she doesn't and it's near damn impossible to get one any other way. Also, work study is factored into your financial aid, so if you don't work, then you don't get that part of your tuition paid off. \n\nBeing legally required isn't the same as not being an asshole. In the first place, in my culture, you'd be considered an asshole and a failure of a parent if your child was taking loans to pay for education. Not saying that's right, but I just find it funny how Americans have such a hands-off approach with their children once they turn 18. It's like, \"ah, we love you, but not enough to care after you turn 18.\" A family is family. I would be more than willing to forfeit a vacation if a close nephew or cousin needed help. I would be more than willing to pay to help my parents out the moment they ask. That's partially because I know we're a family and that they'd do the same for me.

Which isn't to say that you should plan every hour of every day, that's a recipe for disaster, but actively seeking out information BEFORE you go will give you a much better idea of how long you want to spend in each place. For example, I once met someone who had planned to spend an afternoon in Rome, \"to see all the attractions,\" which, uh. Is a bit of an under-budgeted amount of time.\n\nSince you don't have anything specific in mind, here's some general stuff:\n\n\\- Tripadvisor, while bad at attractions and restaurants, is not actually a bad place to look for hotels. (Since you're a first-time traveller, I'm guessing you will want to rely on hotels rather than AirBnB or hostels?) Do remember that you DON'T need a bunch of luxuries since you'll mostly be spending time there to rest and sleep. Look for stuff that is clean and quiet, and ideally central, so you can walk everywhere. And btw - bring at least one pair of good walking shoes!\n\n\\- Get an adapter, and check the locations where you are going here, so you know what you need: [https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/](https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/) Do get this BEFORE you go.\n\n\\- Are you American? If so, do make sure to check if your mobile phone (cell phone?) will work overseas. A lot of them don't.\n\n\\- Also check if your credit/debit card will work. If you don't have chip + PIN, it likely won't in most of Europe.\n\n\\- Communicating in English will work in the vast majority of countries. But learn to focus on the essence of what you're asking.  DO NOT say: \"Excuse me, sorry to trouble you, I hope I'm not bothering you, but I was wondering if you could possibly point me in the direction of the City Museum for the History of the Revolution? I've heard it is somewhere around here, and it sounds really interesting, but I seem to be lost, and I'm not sure if I should go this way or that way???\" DO say: \"Sorry - Museum for the History of the Revolution?\" and point in a direction that you think it might be. A whole lot of extra words = more potential for confusion.\n\n\\- In all of Europe, and in all Asian countries where I have been, waiters do not bring the bill to the table unasked. It is considered rude here, like they're trying to get rid of you. When you want to pay, look around for the waiter who has served you, catch their eye, and raise a finger and look hopeful. This should bring them to your table, and you can ask for the bill. We're a lot less fussed about tips than you are in the US, but 5-10% will generally be appreciated.\n\n\\- Generally, err on the side of politeness, and speak at a lower volume than you'd normally do.",

Since your money isn't going anywhere and it sounds like you can be fairly flexible with your scheduling, I would schedule a 2 week vacation first and get your feet under you with international travel - you can do one week in England and another week going to a few cities on the European continent that interest you. This will help you figure out how you operate as a solo traveler, which kinds of attractions/amenities/locations are of special interest to you, and, most importantly, will give you greater confidence.\n\nThen once you have gained all of this valuable experience you can return home and plan another longer vacation (or two!) still using the money. This will allow you to be more sure of your own interests/wants/needs when making your itinerary, which is really really important. I think if you just plan one huge 1.5 month vacation you run the risk of planning to go several places that you discover fairly quickly aren't for you, and missing out on the types of places and experiences that would have been more valuable. Also honestly it takes a specific kind of person to be able to enjoy a 1.5 month vacation, and if you haven't done much traveling before other than weekend trips you may discover that after 2-3 weeks you feel exhausted and burnt out anyway. You may be exactly the kind of person who would feel excited and energized for each day of travel in a 1.5 month period, but until you do extensive traveling (with long days of sightseeing and lots of walking) you probably can't know that for sure about yourself. \n\nI LOVE to travel, and I consider myself fairly well traveled (I have been to 19 countries so far!) but I have found that 3 weeks is around my limit before I stop enjoying myself. After 3 weeks of sleeping in hotel beds, long days of walking and sightseeing, living out of a suitcase, and having to eat restaurant food for every meal I start to get tired and homesick and the vacation is no longer as enjoyable. I am not saying you are anything like me - many people love long trips! But if you don't know your limits its a bit of a gamble to jump right into a 6 week vacation. \n\nSo I don't think you should deny yourself these vacations that you want to take, but I also would personally recommend against something this long for someone who has yet to do much international travel.",

Do not rent a car under any circumstances, since not only is it expensive, you get additional expenses like paying for parking + tolls. Public transportation in Europe is good, fast, and reliable, and if you do your homework and look for good deals, it's also cheap.\n\n\\- For hotels: actively look for stuff that's CHEAP and clean. It's going to be no-frills, sure, but the water in the shower will be hot and the bed will be your own.  I tend to have a mental budget of \u20ac35 per night, and don't usually have problems finding something. I'm willing to pay up to \u20ac60 a night if I'm feeling fancy, but I try not to feel fancy too often.\n\n\\- Restaurants: Do your research online beforehand for cheap and good restaurants, and ask locals while there. The restaurants in the most touristy areas are overpriced and often not representative of local cuisine at all, just a touristy-fied version thereof. Some of the best and cheapest food I've ever had have been in suburban, no-signs-outside-just-a-nondescript-open-door type places. We're talking \u20ac5-10 for exquisite dinners.\n\n\\- Food in general: don't eat out for every meal, for goodness' sake! Go to the market, look around for what's fresh and in season. A picnic in a park with Roman ruins in it, eating fresh bread from the bakery, some choice cheeses and cured meats + a few fruits in season? Often a much better representation of local cuisine than the restaurants anyway.\n\n\\- In general: don't travel in the high season. Off-season is cheaper, as well as having shorter lines to attraction, and usually more liveable-with temperatures.\n\nBudgetwise, for a single traveller, I personally tend to budget around \u20ac1000 per week if I need to be careful, and up to \u20ac2000 per week if I'm being stupidly, over-the-top extravagant. (I believe the dollar and the Euro are at virtual parity these days.)  Edit: this budget applies to short-term travel, i.e. 2-8 weeks. I would expect to spend a lot less for long-term travel (6 months to a year) because then I'd rent an apartment rather than living in pay-by-the-night kind of accommodation.",

Edinburgh is beautiful and magical and I can not recommend it enough, catch the train from edinburgh down to stratford upon avon for 1 night (i know said dont spread yourself too thin but this one is a wee side trip) and catch an RSC Shakespear play (if you dont like shakespear dont bother with stratford at all, but this is something I would always advise to anyone, as its always an amazing experience) and then catch the train the rest of the way to london for another 3-4 days. Then either catch a plane to Paris or take a train on the Eurotunnel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nParis is beuatiful and worth a look and a great place to start your trip properly, its good for a 4 day stay and its the perfect note to end your wife's visit on. From all the places ive been, which is alot, the follwoing cities have stood out for me in europe:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGhent (Belgium - a Medieval town thats virtually unchanged from its original design. If you want to see proper old european history, its definitely the place to go)\n\nBarcelona (Spain - hectic and bustling with a vibrancy that is intoxicating. The Ramblas and the sagrda familia both jump out here)\n\nRome (Italy - its rome. It's grand, its loud, its marble and historic and its utterly moving and unforgetable. The Vatican is unmissable and deeply moving and the view from the hills of rome is astounding)\n\nVenice (Italy - dont go in the height of summer or the depths of winter, people always forget Venice is basically built on a marsh and the flies and heat can be awful. If you go at the right time of year however, its beautiful and utterly unique)\n\nCapri (Italy - very very peaceful and utterly beautiful but for me it was the journey up Mount Versivurus and the trip round Pompeii; that are both really near by, that make this place truly special.)\n\nLisbon (Portugal - sophisticated and trendy. Amazing food and history. If you stay for 4 days, i would recommend taking the train on one of them for a wee day trip to see the Pena Palace - utterly amazing)\n\nThose are the main ones that moved me, but to be honest theirs so so many:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRiga - Latvia\n\nFlorence - Italy\n\nValetta - Malta\n\nKotor - Montenegro\n\nAthens - Greece\n\nDinant - Belgium\n\nGeneva - Switzerland\n\nMetz - France\n\nBudapest - Hungary\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis list could really just keep going.... and thats only europe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly you need to have a really clear idea of what you want to see and commit to it, dont try and rush it. As you'll have a shit time. Pick a selection of lovely places and just go for it.\n\nGo to nice restuarants and have great food and make memories youll never forget.\n\nIn Europe, any hotels 3 stars or over will be fine. (i tend to stay in 4 star hotels personally, as I enjoy the extra stuff they have on offer, but 3 is grand).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally though... I wouldnt try and be frugal. Go enjoy yourself and what youve got left over, is just that... left over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyhoo have an amazing holiday. Im kinda jealous!",

She will pay that off fairly quickly with a good job she'll get from having that prestigious degree. She is not going to be crippled by this debt, she is going to be fine, she was planning to pay it off anyway. OP has won this money he got as a birthday present for himself and if he uses it to go on vacation no one in his family is worse off, and he gets to do something for himself. I don't see the problem. I would get it if he'd won a million and refused to help her out, I'd get it if she needed some kind of medical procedure or operation to fix some health condition and he decided to spend it on a vacation instead, or maybe even if she was struggling with fertility and desperate for IVF or something. But having debt from college is just normal, it's what they were all expecting from early on, and it's not such a huge debt that it's going to cripple her standard of living. People get cars for that amount of money on medium salaries and pay it off over 5 years no problem.\n\nI guess I just can't imagine asking my parents for this if I were in the same boat as OP's daughter. My parents contributed to my education, everything extra I wanted to do to give myself a leg up, like going somewhere to study that's more expensive, a masters and a PhD, I paid for myself through loans and work. It's just part of making decisions for yourself and taking responsibility for your own life. Yes parents are responsible to a point, and OP gave her money for her education. If my Dad won $30k on the lottery I'd not think of asking him for a chunk of it for my own debt I came into through my own choices. I made those choices because they were beneficial to me, weighing up the pros and cons of great degrees vs debt. My Dad doesn't owe me for those choices, just as OP doesn't owe his daughter.",

Because of \u201cthe expense\u201d, my parents passed on getting me braces, passed on getting my nose fixed when I broke it as a toddler, plus many other things all while I watched them spend thousands on vacations every other year. They also happily paid for my older sister to get braces and spent $1500 when she was a senior in high school to go on a vacation to Paris. We\u2019re less than two years apart so it\u2019s not like there was any big financial changes, either. I\u2019m 25 now and it still hurts to look back on. \n\nIt\u2019s not like your daughter is demanding a car, or extra money like her brother got. Yes you would technically be putting more money towards her but the end result is the same: no debt. She will never see a dime of that money. In a perfect world I don\u2019t think any kid should have to basically be punished for wanting to get the best possible education. I had to transfer to a state school away from my dream school after my freshman year because of the cost, and I was absolutely heartbroken. I\u2019m still sad and feel like I missed out on tapping into my true potential. \n\nOP I wish I could sympathize with you, but I can\u2019t. After being on the receiving end of being a lower priority than your parents I can\u2019t even fathom the vacation crossing my mind in the first place. I think my immediate reaction would be \u201coh man I can\u2019t wait to help out my wife/son/daughter with all this extra money!\u201d, not \u201cI can\u2019t wait to treat myself!\u201d I think you have to give up that mindset when you have children. Like, personally I would be much happier spreading my newfound wealth with the ones I love and then making the best of whatever is left over. \n\nOP I think you need to step back from all these comments, your perspective, your wife\u2019s perspective, and just look at it simply: how would you feel if you were in your daughter\u2019s shoes? Looking back in 30 years, will you think you did everything you possibly could to set your children up for success? Would you think of yourself as an exemplary parent who always prioritized their family over themselves? \n\nI don\u2019t think the vacation is worth it. I think (hopefully, if you have a conscience) you\u2019d end up feeling some degree of guilt because of hurting your daughters feelings, and it\u2019s also very possible it could irrevocably damage your relationship. There\u2019s nothing wrong with saying \n\u201cYou know what, I think you make a great point. I want you to have the same opportunities post-grad that your brother was able to have and that includes being debt-free. I do want to do some traveling but ultimately I always want to put my family first.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s okay to be wrong sometimes, and what makes you a better person is admitting it and learning from it. Don\u2019t be afraid to entertain the idea that you aren\u2019t totally in the right, because being willing to take a good look at yourself and take constructive criticism is how you continue to grow. Bottom line: YTA. I wish there was a nicer way to say that haha but it just means that while I think it\u2019s totally understandable to be excited at the possibility of spending this new money on yourself, I firmly believe that the people you love should always come first.",

I honestly feel there are some deeper problems here in your relationship. There seems to be an environment of selfishness built by both you and your wife. I\u2019ve never understood how people in a \u201chealthy\u201d relationship could keep their lives so separate and say things like this money is mine, etc. It seems unhealthy to me to be gone on a vacation from your wife for that much time and also unnecessary. Why not go on vacation for the same time as your wife and save the money to plan a trip the next year when vacation has built back up? Because I think like many that are part of marriages that are unhappy, it\u2019s easier to not be around the \u201cdifficult\u201d partner. It\u2019s why men that I\u2019ve worked with would sometimes rather be at work so that they aren\u2019t with the \u201cnag\u201d at home. I think that you two have built this odd environment in your family and your perspective only make sense because of that. But other people in normal healthy relationships don\u2019t think and act in this manner because they spent time building an environment of love and sharing in their home and would never in a million years plan to vacation away from each other for that amount of time, would never act as if some money earned or inherited was only a one sided affair, or do any of the other selfish things that have been mentioned in your post.",

I believe even the law sort of works in this way, where if a couple splits, the lesser earning partner is basically entitled to a portion of what the more successful partner made (see Bezos recently).\n\nAll that being said, it is your money like you said and you do deserve to have a nice vacation and nice things but from a healthy family perspective there seems to be something wrong with this overall picture.",

This is a trap (mostly) lower-income people fall in to.\n\nI know several people who travel internationally basically every year.  None of them would consider spending $600/day on vacation.  Of course they have $100s of thousands in the bank.  But they don't feel the need to spend it as fast as possible, because they know the money won't disappear and will be there later.\n\nIt would be really nice if there was a way to get more out of your money than 1 long vacation.  If it's your first one it will be a little rough.  And most people get sick of travel after a while and won't enjoy the full 6 weeks.\n\nIf you're 50, check out Road Scholar and see if anything catches your eye.  They have a huge variety of vacation packages, and the prices are very reasonable (they are a non-profit).  I'm sure you could take several fantastic ones, and they're very easy compared to planning it out yourself.  Just winging it sounds fun, but it's easy to spend too much vacation time on the computer/phone planning the next thing.\n\nAlso if you like nature and haven't been to all the national parks, I wouldn't write off taking some US vacations too.  The national parks are amazing, and in particular the southwest (Zion etc) is very unique and can rival anything.\n\nI don't think it's wrong to spend the money on something nice for yourself.  You should tell your daughter to go to the Ivy League school, take it seriously, network, and get a job where paying back the $29k is nothing.  I just think you could get so much more out of it if you could manage to set some money aside and take several great trips over time.",
