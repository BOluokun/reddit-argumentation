  "post content": "I live in the country, awful area for wifi and I've got seven siblings doing online school right now, 3 have special education needs. I'm a secondary school student so I change calls multiple times a day. I've been having issues recently since some line went down after a big wind. \n\nIf there's too many of us on a call the wifi will crash entirely so I took to asking my teachers to record the lesson and posting it on the team so I can keep on top of the work, my sister is doing the same so the younger ones can concentrate on theirs in real time. I'm pretty much a straight A student, and don't need a leaving cert for what I want to do after school (only a few months left in school as is) so I can afford to do this. \n\nI got a message off my principal today, asking me why i haven't been engaging in certain class and i explained my issue and what i asked the teachers to do and all were doing it. He said that he understands but I should rotate with my siblings so I can attend classes. I said my solution works perfectly fine for us and that I've not been falling behind. I'm back in real school Monday anyways so it's not an issue.\n\nHe said maybe look at getting better wifi in, which i said isnt possible right now and he kept saying how I need to fine a better solution. I said \"Sir, I understand you want me to attend these classes but I can't pull fiber optic broadband out of my hole (aka ass) just for the next 3 days\". Anyways he called my mom and she thinks I'm an asshole for disrespecting him so much. AITA?\n\nEDIT: 6 to 7 because I forgot one\n\nEdit: she/her\n\nEdit 3: Lads, I've something to confess.

They were introduced last year when COVID was happening in Ireland. I was one of the many students who recieved calculated grades last year. It wasn't the best and was based on your performance throughout your school years, mainly 5th and 6th year. It also included your Junior Cert exam results which was done in your 3rd year of secondary school.\n\nThe Leaving Certificate is set over 2 years; 5th year & 6th year. 6th year is your last year of secondary school before you head off to college or not. It kinda depends on the person's choice. Usually you'd sit 7 exams in June; Irish, English, Maths, your 3rd language (main ones being Spanish, French and German, although it depends on what your school offers) and 3 other subjects. I did Geography, Art and Home Economics (These subjects also differ depending on the school you attend.)\n\nHere in Ireland, the grade and level(Higher or Ordinary) at which you sit your exam earns you a certain amount of points. Your best 6 subjects are added up and that is your total. Every single college course in Ireland requires a certain amount points to get in. The more competitive/popular/complex the course is, the higher the points, an example would be medical related courses would have higher points than an Arts course.\n\nHonestly I could go on and on about every single detail of the Leaving Cert but it would take too long.\n\nHere's the points system for Leaving Cert grades. http://imgur.com/gallery/OjRV8kt",
