  "post content": "\n\nMe (M32) and my wife, Dahlia (F28) lost our apartment 2 months ago and moved in with mom temporarily. Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise.\n\n\nFyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that! \n\nFor example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out.\n\n\nLast night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was \"bonkers\" because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some \"explicit\" picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such \"demand\" and be pushy still.\n\n\nThis morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable.\n\n\nAnthony has been a friend of mine for 10 years. I wouldn't have asked to move in with him if I didn't have such strong bond with him. He himself constantly talks about all the things and situations I helped him out with and we are considered brothers.",

This isn't about being from a \"conservative home,\" so what is really going on here? Was she raised in a cult, is she affiliated with some fringe religious group?\n\nSeriously, you're staying in THEIR home and throwing a fit over him... Kissing his wife in a photo? And your wife is throwing a fit and refusing to leave her room until they take down their perfectly normal wedding photo?\n\nAnd your comment about just doing it to keep guests happy is so baffling given the situation. Like, the photo isn't the issue here. And it's not the only problem that's already happened. So, your wife also freaked out after accidentally taking a sip of his water, does this mean he's also not supposed to drink water in his own home to keep her comfortable? And then she got all upset because he had the audacity to walk past the door, which she had left open, while she just happened to be sitting on the bed. So, he's also not allowed to walk through his home. What else is he not going to be allowed to do in his own house, breathe?\n\nIt would be bad enough if you were just guests that were visiting for a weekend, but this guy was extremely generous to allow the two of you to stay there while you figure out your financial burden. You're not even guests in the traditional sense, you're basically just roommates who aren't contributing financially. And this is how you treat him for taking you into his home?\n\nWhat is really going on with your wife? And why are you enabling this atrocious behavior and extreme entitlement? You letting her continue with her childish tantrum, in SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME, is making you as much of an asshole as your wife. Though, I do wonder if there's an underlying mental illness behind your wife's behavior.\n\nYou keep this up you're going to need another place to stay.
