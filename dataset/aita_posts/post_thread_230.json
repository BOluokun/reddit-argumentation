  "post content": "\r  \nSo i recently proposed to my long-term girlfriend, and we are planning for a wedding in summer next year, everything is still very early stages. My fiance has expressed that she wants a child-free wedding, which I am all down for but I want to make one expectation, my son (15M), i had him from a previous relationship and we have evenly split custody of him.\r  \n\r  \nUntil now my fiance has gotten along great with him, we've had days out as a family, she's gone to see his games (he plays ice hockey) and she's even taken him out on fun days just the two of them.\r  \n\r  \nI brought up that I wanted to make an exception to the no kids rule for my son, she shot the idea down straight away and said that she didn't want anyone under 16 there as she doesn't want to feel like she or anyone else has to babysit on her special day.\r  \n\r  \nI told her that no one would have to babysit him, he\u2019s 15 and she knows he's well-behaved and a generally quiet kid. She then changed her reasoning and asked why i wanted my old family and life on the day I was supposed to making a commitment to her and our new family, I told her while I will be making a commitment to her, my son will still very much be my son and my family.\r  \n\r  \nShe then equated it to wanting my ex at our wedding, which I do not and never asked. I told her that i don't care about the aesthetics of the wedding, and that she can pick everything else, the food, the aesthetic, the music, the dress, but all i want is my family at the wedding (my parents, my sisters and my son), that is my only ultimatum when it comes to our wedding.\r  \n\r  \nShe started calling me controlling by giving me an ultimatum and said I had initially agreed to a child-free wedding and now im \u201cgaslighting\u201d her. I said we can have a mainly child-free wedding, but with this one exception, an expectation that guests can't even complain about being unfair since the only child is the son of the groom.\r  \n\r  \nShe called me a dick and is now not talking to me, I really think this is a reasonable want, but maybe im not seeing something, so AITA?\r  \n",

And not a crying baby or a terrible two, but a *fifteen year old*, a kid that will be old enough to drive next year-when the wedding is???\n\nIf this goes on as she wants, do you think your kid won\u2019t remember? \n\nYea, I\u2019m sorry, bud, this is all kinds of evil stepmother red flags-the whole thing about you making a new commitment to *her* and her family, and equating having your son there to having your ex *wife* there! \n\nDude. Get out now while you just have to eat the non refundable deposits for the wedding. Save yourself and your kid a world of hurt. YWBTA if you marry this woman. \n\nedit to add, you have never had a fight like this before, because up to this point, she has been putting on a show. But now she is comfortable enough in the relationship to show you who she really is.",

That's something I've felt in my core from my earliest memories but nobody would acknowledge it. Whenever we would visit his house it was made very clear that it wasn't our home too. We had to do whatever our younger brother wanted, we couldn't play with his toys but didn't have our own there either. Little brother literally didn't believe our Dad was our Dad too, I remember him very vocally denying it and would also tell us that our grandmother was only his, not ours. Dad paid for him to get a private education and take vacations overseas while not bothering to pay his owing child support to us, forgetting our birthdays and we grew up in poverty while he and his new family were comfortably upper middle class. I hold nothing against my little brother now, we're all grown adults and he's actually a really good dude, he didn't know any better when we were kids, why would be think we were siblings when he only saw us every few years and Dad obviously didn't talk about us ever?\n\nOP you are NTA but you're on a very slippery slope and need to be careful and think about your priorities here.

She was hoping that when they will get children together his daughter will be less present in his dad\u2019s mind and life. The guy did not even think about it TWICE. He was disgusted (as he should) and dumped her. Then he went with his  daughter on holidays during the week the wedding should have occurred. \nStarting a new family does not mean that you should dump the previous one or make it less valuable. And just imagine the image that your son is going to have of YOU and HER.\n\nSorry English is not my native language\u2026\n\nSometimes on REDDIT I think that people are overreacting but for ONCE it\u2019s not the case at all. Your son is your family. He is not a ghost of your old life. Please, I beg you take the good decision and to be a good example for your son.",
