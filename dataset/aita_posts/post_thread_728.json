It means I have to be up at 4:30 in the morning and it just sucks. \n\nAll the early customers are these boomer assholes who just love to demean me while they sit on their asses drinking coffee and collecting retirement. The worst is Dan. I\u2019d say Dan is abusive to me.\n\nLots of stuff has happened with him but his latest thing started last week when he said he needed a receipt. I was like \u201cdude, you paid for a donut and coffee with cash, why do you need a receipt?\u201d He said \u201cI\u2019m not your dude, print the receipt.\u201d  My manager came running over and apologized to dan and said for me just to print off the receipt. Dan gave me such a smug \u201cI won\u201d look. \n\nWell since then every morning Dan asks for his receipt, doesn\u2019t even look at it and then throws it in the trash while staring at me. It\u2019s just a big duck thing to make me feel bad and he\u2019s \u201cover me.\u201d \n\nI told my dad this afternoon that I\u2019m going to say no in the morning. My dad said \u201cdon\u2019t be an asshole, you\u2019re the employee, you do what the customer and employer says.\u201d  I tried to argue but he said I\u2019m being stupid and petty. I was like dan started it. My dad said basically to shut up.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don\u2019t print that receipt?",

But I sense you are looking for a more complete explanation.  \n\nFirst, while Dan also seems like he could be a jerk , nothing you have shared even begins to approach abusive.  \n\nSecond, he asked for the receipt and you seem to think you are entitled to know why.   That you will provide it only if he gives you a good enough reason.  Why is not any of your business.   Maybe he is establishing an alibi for a crime.  Maybe he is a crazy scrap booker.  Maybe they are perfect to use as scrap paper.  Maybe he is tracking stuff for tax purposes.  Perhaps he found a sugar momma to underwrite his coffee habit -- but she demands receipts.   Maybe he uses them to post an update on facebook everyday.  Maybe he is tracking where he spends every penny.  Maybe he thought you were over charging.  Doesn't matter.\n\nThird, dude, you work retail.  Dealing with unpleasant customers is sort of in the job description.   Getting into some sort of strange contest with customers is not.\n\nFourth, you might be required by law to provide a receipt exposing your boss to fines.  Even if that is not the case, refusing to provide one could well result in your termination and refusal to provide a reference.  And might make your boss think you are somehow skimming....",
