  "post content": "While me and my husband are childless and don\u2019t want any kids of our own, we love to spend time with our nieces and nephews. This includes my brother\u2019s 11-year-old son Allan, 6-year-old daughter Ava, and my sister\u2019s 10-year-old daughter Kelly.\r  \n\r  \nLast May, we planned a weekend trip with the kids to a beach town about an hour away. We did this to spend time with them and also to confirm if they would be ready for longer overnight trips, and we\u2019d also be within driving distance of home if any of them needed to go home early.\r  \n\r  \nMe and my husband expected that Ava may have had a hard time being away from her parents overnight since she\u2019s still 6. But both she and Allan were well-behaved the whole trip. Kelly however misbehaved for the entirety of the beach trip:\r  \n\r  \nFriday: Pick-up from their parents\u2019 houses around 5 and got to the beach town by 7. During the car ride, Kelly was being an instigator and kept trying to start a fight with Allan. Kelly was not listening at the grocery store and refused to take turns with Allan and Ava with the TV.\r  \n\r  \nSaturday: Kelly threw a fit because she wanted ice cream and we told her that we wouldn\u2019t be going to the ice cream store until later. We told her she could have fruit for a snack if she was hungry and Kelly threw some of the fruit in the trash before my husband stopped her. \r  \n\r  \nAt the beach, Kelly kept re-filling the hole Ava was trying to dig with sand despite being told multiple times to stop. Kelly kept trying to start fights with her cousins. During dinner, Kelly was rude to our waitress and was sarcastic the first time we told her to apologize.\r  \n\r  \nSunday: At the gift store, Kelly wanted to have a conch shell and a mermaid doll but didn\u2019t have enough pocket money to get both. When we told Kelly she would need to pick one and couldn\u2019t have both, she ended up being allowed to have neither because she kept throwing a fit.\r  \n\r  \nAt the hotel, Kelly was not listening and kept trying to watch TV despite being told multiple times to help with packing suitcases. During the car ride home, Kelly was again being an instigator and kept trying to start fights with Allan and Ava.\r  \n\r  \nMe and my husband told my sister that Kelly was not coming on any more overnight trips with us because of her behavior. My sister is angry now because we haven\u2019t changed our minds and are staying true to our word by only bringing Allan and Ava to our week-long trip in August.\r  \n\r  \nMy sister told me that Kelly is just acting like a kid and she\u2019s only 10. I agreed with my sister that, exactly, Kelly is a 10-year-old. There\u2019s a reason we waited until the kids got to their current ages. She\u2019s too old to be constantly misbehaving and throwing fits like a 4-year-old.\r  \n\r  \nShe says Allan and Ava may be mature/calm for their ages but I am out of line to punish Kelly for not being the exception to her age and she hopes me and my husband feel good about ourselves after excluding a child. Is my sister right that we\u2019re the AHs?\r",

Loving your child means wanting what is best for them, not always giving them what they want. Loving them is providing for their needs, not always indulging their whims. My parents made us, their children, the center of their world. Daddy worked hard to provide shelter, clothing and food for our family. Mom stayed at home and cared for it and us children. Our lives were centered around the family. We knew that we were the most important people in our parents lives, besides themselves as a couple. We were taught that the family was our world. The church was an extended part of our world. But, and here is the caveat...we were also taught that as vast as our centered world was to us, we were a tiny speck in the world at large. We were taught to be supportive of one another, while also becoming independent. We were taught that it was our duty to strive and make the world a better place than it was. We were taught to love and respect people simply because they were people, no matter how different they were than us or if their beliefs weren't the same. Our parents, having decided to have children, dedicated themselves to raise those children to be good, decent and kind people. Yes, we were the center of their universe, everything they did was in effort to provide, support, love, teach and guide us into becoming good people. Our parents KNEW that we would do wrong, all humans do, and they corrected us because they loved us, but no wrongs we committed could ever change their love and commitment to us. Too many parents today have practically raised themselves. No rules, no example of good parenting. Too many children raised with ONLY the rod instead of love being the primary resource. Too many children abandoned, neglected and abused who grew up into parents who want to so far distance themselves from their own troubled upbringing, that they swing too far to the other extreme. Too rigidly controlling or too lax, too protective or outright neglectful, too harsh in their discipline or no discipline at all. Children are clean slates, sponges. As parents and grandparents, aunts and uncles and older siblings and cousins and teachers...it is up to us to make sure what is written on those slates and what is absorbed by those sponges is good and right and loving. Once the slate is full and the sponge saturated, it is very difficult if not impossible, to change the outcome.",

OP says they love to spend time with their nieces and nephews *including* Kelly, so this indicates to me that Kelly doesn\u2019t always behave the way she did on the trip, I would be trying to find out what was it in that trip that specifically Kelly found challenging. Maybe Kelly normally spends time 1:1 and not with Alan and Ava, maybe she has something like autism where she struggles with increased noise, different surroundings, things not going how she expects them eg schedule for ice cream. Yea it could be bratty behaviour, but I would be thinking about those other things too. I also think that just expecting Kelly\u2019s behaviour to just change is likely to be unsuccessful unless expectations are spelled out to her. If it is \u2018just\u2019 behavioural, that will have come from how parents treat her and she\u2019s not independently going to understand where she\u2019s gone wrong.

But I feel it did have a lot of positive effects in shaping my character and manners. Could my parents have done it a bit lighter? Sure. Was it heavy-handed on their part? Oh yes of course. But I can see how it made me a better person, and while I definitely won't repeat on my son what they did to me, I am thankful that their discipline established clear and firm boundaries for my behaviour.",
