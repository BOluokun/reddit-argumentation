  "post content": "\nContext: Me f26 and my husband m32 welcomed our daughter several months ago. So far we've agreed on every decision made regarding our daughter but the topic of peircing her ears came up and he said he didn't like the idea despite me explaining that 1. It's normal thing for babies and 2. It looks pretty 3. no it's not cultural we're both white but it's a great new experience imo. He said he needed time to think about it but weeks went by and he hasn't said okay yet. Mom suggested we do it behind his back and he'll then come around and see for himself that it's a good thing since he was having doubts and being indecisive. I was hasitant but I agreed and chose a day where he was out all day.\n\nThankfully it went smoothly but when my husband got home and found out he lost his temper and went on about what a major breach of trust I just committed and how I should have never decided to do this without him fully agreeing since he's the parent too and got extra mad that I went behind his back and was being sneaky and untruthful about it. I tried to explain that first it was my mom's idea and I didn't think he'd overreact like that but he insisted that I did was not okay and that I overruled him as a parent and damaged the trust we have and also put our daughter through pain and discomfort. I had an argument with him and told him he was acting like this is just his daughter, I'm the mother and my opinion does have heavier weight than his to some degree. He got offended by that and went to stay with his mom who called and berated me for going behind her son's back and treating him as a less than when it comes to our daughter but I never understood why he thought that.\n\nHe is not talking to me now. I think he's being selfish by saying he needed time to think about it and trying to stall without considering my point of view. Mom is on my side here but he and my inlaws said I screwed up for making such decision without his \"okay\" and going behind his back to get it done.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit/ putting this out there/ My husband was aware that I had plans to get our daughter's ears peirced and we've had many many discussions about it so it wasn't like it was out of the blue and I didn't bring it up with him. I did but he kept giving me the same \"I need time to think about it\" the entire time. How long was I supposed to wait? Why he kept stalling instrad of just saying \"just no\"? He just kept stalling and putting off any further discussions/compromises that we could've had as a way maybe to get me to just abandon the whole idea.",

(Spoiler alert: you don't.)\n* You violated his trust, not just as her dad, but also as your spouse. It's his child, too - you don't get to make decisions unilaterally. Going behind his back because Mommy told you to? Yeah, I wonder why he's pissed.\n* Piercings are not OK for babies. Your daughter has to go through a lot of pain and discomfort - if she wants it, she should be able to choose (when she's older of course). Getting HER piercings because YOU think it's pretty? And without consulting her other parent? YTA. \n\nETA: Piercings are normal in certain cultures, but they still cause pain and discomfort. My wording was wrong. The previous edit was made due to a wording error and lack of thought on my part.",

Only an assumption since OP didn\u2019t write exactly where she went to get it done, but I\u2019d bet on it tbh.\n\nEdit: forgot the judgement lol. YTA, OP\n\nEdit 2: A lot are asking if I\u2019m allergic to certain metals. No, I am not. I can wear any metal as I please\u2014I consistently wear necklaces, bracelets, and rings with absolutely no issue. I have also not worn earrings for 17 years. The piercing holes never closed, have to be popped like pimples to get the pus out, and my earlobes hurt 75% of the time when I touch them. My ears are like this because my mom was stupid and thought getting my 2-year-old ears pierced in the middle of a mall with a piercing gun would be okay. DO NOT USE PIERCING GUNS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NO MATTER THE AGE.\n\nEdit 3: Holy shit my most upvoted comment!! \n\nLots of lovelies are telling me to go see a dermatologist\u2014don\u2019t worry, I am, haha! It\u2019s for a possibly cancerous mole, but I\u2019ve set myself a reminder to mention my ears!!

Exactly my thoughts and what I wanted to say.\n\nOP, how would you feel when your husband took your child out to do something you haven't agreed upon and didn't really want, but said you would consider? \n\nLet's say you were to have a son and he wanted the kid circumcised, not for religion, but because he felt that'd be a good idea. It looks prettier or something.\nAnd you're not sure if you want that for your son. You say you will think about it and he doesn't bring it up for months, so you just do your own thing and kinda forget about it.\nThen one day, you come home and find out that he has gone behind your back and took your son to get circumcised.\nYou didn't agree upon that, he didn't ask you again. He didn't listen to your concerns or took into consideration how you felt, and then he also dares to say: \"yeah, but I'm the dad, and as a man I have a bigger say in whether or not my son gets circumcised.\"\n\nNow, I don't know your opinion about circumcision, but I figured this may be an example that'd do the job.\n\nYTA, OP. Major ass.\nYou did it because you think it's pretty.\nDid you think about looking up the risk?\nDid you think of just bringing it up again and see if he changed his opinion?\nDid you think of maybe waiting a bit longer before piercing her ears?\nThose ears aren't going anywhere, so what was your rush?!\n\nI agree with your husband that you did something to betray his trust. You went behind his back to do something you know he disagreed with before.\nYou're not the only parent in the relationship and your thinking that you have more of a say as a mother is quite toxic thinking. You should be a unity. There will be plenty of moments where you need to be one front and you are ruining that.\nBy not being an united front, you will end up confusing your child and giving them \"favourites\" in parents. Because: \"Dad said no to this, so let's try and ask mom, because she will likely not check if we asked dad already...\" or, \"...she doesn't care if dad said no already and will just say yes.\"\nYou may be creating an unequal and unfair environment if you keep this course.\nI'd advise you to talk to your husband and come to some sort of manner to actually do this together, as two parents forming one unity.\n\nIt can happen that you don't agree about something, but then you talk and listen to one another. You make it a point of discussion, or even a debate with relevant arguments if need be. And then you either decide, compromise, or find the middle ground.\nThis, what you did, is not the way to go.\n\n(All this comes from someone who has experienced parents who were constantly divided. Eventually one became more dominant than the other. They divorced and I never felt safe with one and always felt like I had to support the other. My situation might've been different than yours and it may have been more extreme, but what you state is basically how it started: one making decisions and not listening to the other. So believe me, it is confusing for a kid)\n\nP.s. sorry for the long rant/post",

Finally in my early 20s I decided I was going to get them re-pierced. I went to one of the best piercers in my city who came recommended by my friends. He took extreme care to get the placement and angle exactly right so the earrings would sit just right. Then he pierced right through my ugly scar tissue. They healed perfectly. It's been YEARS since I've had an earring in, but the holes have never closed up, it's just that the skin at the backs of them will heal over if I wait too long. (My mom is 71 and got hers pierced with a sterilized sewing needle at a sleepover, and even hers healed better than mine from a piercing gun.
