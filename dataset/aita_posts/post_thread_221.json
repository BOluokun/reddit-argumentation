  "post content": "I know that weddings are a big deal and lots of planning goes into it. However I am very torn. \n\nMy (22f) little sister (18f) got engaged to her long time bf a few months ago. I live in a different state to her and travel can be expensive. Especially during holiday seasons. \n\nI\u2019m a full time student studying a very intensive course, midwifery, and next year I have two 6 week placements at the hospitals. My sister had already stated she was going to have an engagement party in April and it became a massive fight when I said that logically I would not be able to go. It is during one of my placements, I am saving to move with my bf and like I said it is expensive during Easter holidays. I felt really guilty, but after lots of back and forth she accepted it and we were able to talk again. \n\nNow I love my sister I do, and I would want to be there for her, but she told me yesterday that she will be surprising people during the engagement party and turn it into the wedding. When I asked what about people who would t be able to make it for an engagement party but would want to for a wedding she said that anyone who actually cares for her would be at the party no matter what. I kinda felt like it was a stab at me. \n\nI told her I will 100% try and be there. But I don\u2019t think it would be possible on that date. I just found out our other sister (we don\u2019t speak) is graduating her college course that month as well and may have trouble going. As well as most of the family live out of state and would have trouble going during the busiest season of their business. \n\nWould I be the ass hole for asking her to change her wedding date. \n\nPs. Hope your not on reddit but if you do see this and recognise me sis I love you but just as very torn.\n\nUpdate:  after lots of chatting between the family she has decided to move the wedding to the end of the year and not to do a surprise one. Whilst I would prefer she not get married so young and maybe travel instead with her partner, she is dead set on marriage. Can only support her and try to be there for her. She isn\u2019t happy with me, but has been willing to compromise.",

You CANNOT reasonably expect people to travel for both. People travel for weddings, not engagement parties. So she is going to be pretty disappointed with the turnout. She is definitely showing her age with these immature shenanigans.\n\nEdit: thank you for the silver",
