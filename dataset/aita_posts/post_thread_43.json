  "post content": "I will try to make this short so here goes...\n\nI am a 30 year old married man.  We recently had a party at our place for some close friends after CoVid. 7 of us total.  By different circumstances, we don\u2019t have much family and we decided that we would be our \u201cbubble\u201d of people that we would see during CoVid times.  Four woman and three guys.\n\nLong story short, we drank quite a bit and everyone was planning at crashing at our place.  No big deal, nothing unusual.  The one girl there that recently became single drank a lot (likely due to the breakup) and passed out on the floor.  I moved her onto the couch near us so we could continue talking while monitoring her (didn\u2019t want her to choke on puke or something).   Well, eventually she stirs, rolls over and reveals that she has pooped herself down her skirt and down her legs (also on my couch but it was a shitty couch; now it was a really shitty couch).\n\nEveryone laughs at first then starts gagging.  The couples basically say that\u2019s a sign the night is over and they start going to their rooms.  Well, I\u2019m the lone holdout that we can\u2019t just leave her covered in poop. My wife was too drunk to help and went to bed.\n\nI was conflicted because this was a close friend so I did what I thought was best.  I grabbed baby wipes and cleaned her up. To be clear, I did not touch her vagina at all.  I did clean the poop off her butt and just quickly ran a wipe through her butt crack. (I\u2019m a nurse so I have a super strong gag reflex.)\n\nI slept on the couch next to her just in case I heard her choking.\n\nNext morning everyone wakes up and comes to see their friend covered in poop.  Well she\u2019s not anymore and that\u2019s when it starts.  \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s assault.\u201d\n\u201cYou basically groped her.\u201d\n\nMy wife was no help, which hurt badly, and implied that I should have gotten her to do it.  Despite the fact that she was way too drunk to help.\n\nI feel like my friends aren\u2019t messaging me as much anymore and I\u2019m being excluded.  Today was the final straw when I looked at my wife\u2019s phone and saw a group chat of the girls and one of my best friends suggested the passed out girl file a police report.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.  I\u2019m so frustrated because I tried to do the right thing.  I\u2019m a god damned nurse, cleaning poop off someone is so clinical and practiced it\u2019s almost routine at this point.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;dr - cleaned poop off a drunk female friend now other friends are ostracizing me and basically labeling me a predator.\n\nEdit: everyone is asking.\n\nNot same couch.  Same room, different couch.  Sorry. That was vague. \n\nThe girl who had the accident was horribly embarrassed the next day and left shortly after.  I didn\u2019t harp on it because I was trying to not embarrass her even as everyone was calling me out.  I apologized day of, which in hindsight, kinda makes me look guilty of something.\n\nEdit #2:  I didn\u2019t expect this to become so big.  I had to sleep so that\u2019s why the lack of replies.  Basically, I\u2019ll try to answer the questions I saw over and over. \n\nI am in Canada.  So when I said \u201cpost-CoVid\u201d what I meant is my province is introducing social bubbles of people that interact with only those specific people.   I recognize that CoVid is a still very much a pandemic.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen a lot of people mentioning that I should stop associating with those people.  This makes sense except for the fact (I\u2019m not sure I mentioned) we all became close because we don\u2019t have other family.  They are really all I have.  My wife was one of those close friends before we got married which is why she still has those private chats I guess.  We also have a young child together which is why I even had baby wipes in the first place.  So leaving my wife really isn\u2019t an option I\u2019m even entertaining despite the literal hole I feel in my chest over this.\n\nAnd no, this may be a horrible thing, but I didn\u2019t have permission to read my wife\u2019s phone.  She got a message on her phone, I picked it up and it unlocked for my face.  (Her face unlocks my phone as well, we don\u2019t really have secrets that way.). The messages were right there, roughly 10 back and forth, and I couldn\u2019t help but read them.  I know that\u2019s a violation of her privacy and I wouldn\u2019t normally do that. \n\nI appreciate a lot of people saying that I was okay in my actions but this will be the last response I make on this.  The negative comments and messages I have been receiving privately are too much to take.  The positivity sent by some people is outstanding and I\u2019m so thankful.  I can\u2019t keep reading messages that I\u2019m a rapist or that I sexually assaulted my friend.  After the pandemic, working insane hours, taking care of a\nBaby and now this... I\u2019m emotionally drained to a point I\u2019ve never been to.\n\nMods can lock this if they want.   Thank you for the support.",

I've been in several similarly sketchy looking situations in my early 20's as I was naturally a really good sitter for psychedelics even when I was tripping as well, and it's incredibly difficult to know what the right right thing is when taking care of an obliterated friend. If she'd have been a dude, they'd likely be making fun of you for cleaning up his shit, honestly. \n\nI've changed/half-assed wiped down vomit-covered and passed out/too sideways to speak much less function in any way friends/acquaintances of both sexes, partly because I didn't want them stewing in their own vomit, but mostly because I wanted as little vomit on my stuff as possible. Only one was ever anything but grateful, and she was more mad that I didn't wash her soiled expensive club wear than she was that I'd put her in basketball shorts and a Tshirt. Of course I never touched anyone inappropriately and took no pleasure in what I was doing. \n\nThe one that still gives me anxiety when I think about it was when a relatively new coworker went from almost zero to sloppy in an hour, leading us to believe that she'd been drugged, since she typically held her liquor pretty well. I lost the rock, paper, scissors tournament, so she was my responsibility. It didn't dawn on me at the time that I should bring someone with me to protect us both. \n\nAfter she'd sent us to the wrong apartment 3 times, I was fed up. So I took her to mine, and had to help her the whole way to the couch, where she passed out halfway through a glass of water. I stayed in the living room watching TV/playing video games for a couple hours to make sure she was okay, then went to bed.\n\nAt some point in the night, she came into my room, stripped naked, and tried to sloppily seduce me, calling me Steven the whole time. That's not even close to my name, which she knew damn well and was even farther from the nickname she had for me. Obviously I noped out and tried hard to get her dressed, but she slapped me and called me names when I tried to put a shirt on her, so I let her have the bed and left her tucked in and crying to sleep on the couch with 2 bottles of water and a couple advil on the nightstand, and a vomit bin on the floor.\n\nShe woke up naked in a queen sized bed in strange apartment, only remembered crying naked in an empty bed that wasn't hers, and understandably freaked out. I tried to calm her down and explain what happened and why she woke up where/the way she did, but as far as she was concerned, I'd raped her. Thankfully, I'd spent the night blowing up our group text with updates about all the bullshit, complete with pics of her passed out fully clothed on the couch, and subsequently tucked in and covered but obviously topless in my bed. I showed her the text chain, and it still took the group en masse telling her I'm not that guy for her to accept that I'd actually kept her safe and that she shouldn't go to the police. \n\nRest assured I never took care of a sloppy female acquaintance again.",

You tried to help, and probably prevented a terrible rash/infection.\n\nEveryone else is the AH:\n\n* **The \u201cfriends\u201d:** they laugh at the expense of the girl who shit her pants and not one person offered to help. In the morning they literally get up ready to make fun of the girl! They go to view her like she\u2019s an exhibit in a museum of mortification. That\u2019s just cruel. Some friends you got there.\n\n* **Your wife:** she\u2019s probably the biggest AH here IMO. She should be communicating with YOU. If she is hurt, or feels uncomfortable she should be opening a dialogue with you so you can confront the issue and move on. **Your wife is actively participating in the narrative that you sexually assaulted a girl covered in shit. She is making a choice to communicate with the people who are against you, the people who are discussing filing a police report for sexual assault** instead of communicating with you, her husband. Your friends are isolating you, and your wife is choosing to participate in that. She\u2019s putting everyone before you. **That\u2019s the shittiest thing In this entire post.** She doesn\u2019t have your back, she isn\u2019t supporting you, and she isn\u2019t trying to diffuse the situation.  I\u2019m sorry this is happening.\n\n* **The girl who shit her pants** first of all who the fuck gets that drunk at 30 that they shit their pants at a friends house? That\u2019s inappropriate, and embarrassing behavior. If she doesn\u2019t view it as a sexual assault she should stand up to the friend group and say that. She\u2019s an AH for letting them sway her into something that could potentially ruin your life.\n\nBottom line: you\u2019re a trained medical professional. You didn\u2019t enjoy wiping her shit up. You weren\u2019t sexually aroused by wiping the shit that was running down her fucking legs. You were just trying to help. Your friends are sexualizing this, and are trying to convince this girl she\u2019s a victim. Your wife isn\u2019t trying to defend you in any way from these allegations, and she hasn\u2019t show you support.. Your wife is making some interesting choices here and I think you need to have a calm, sit down talk with her.  See what she needs, how she feels, and what you both need to do to overcome this.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d also like to add that I would recommend reaching out to Ms. Poopy Pants and talking this through with her. I would apologize (it will not make you look guilty). Tell her your intentions, emphasize that you\u2019re a medical professional and were just trying to help. Be sincere. I\u2019d try to nip this in the bud as quick as possible. \n\nGood luck to you man, you seem like you\u2019re a good man who has good intentions. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, I can\u2019t imagine how stressful or scary it is. If you want to talk please DM anytime.",
