No other details.  \n\nIn my history of going to super bowl parties they've always been family friendly. So I didn't think twice about bringing my kids to my buddies house.\u00a0 We are on the West Coast and its over by 8.\u00a0 So its a day thing and not really a late night.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \nApparently, my kid was not invited and my buddy who hosted wasn't happy he was brought over.\u00a0 We had a discussion that turned into an argument and we left.\u00a0 He never mentioned no kids.\u00a0 But am I the asshole for assuming he could come?\u00a0\u00a0",

A baby is generally cool as long as someone is holding him and looking at him. A 15 month old is a TODDLER. A walking, \u201ctalking\u201d, ball of potential catastrophic destruction. Very different things at an adult party. \n\nSigned, a mother of four.\n\nETA:  Verdict - YTA. You should have verified that your toddler was welcome. Barring that, you should have accepted with grace that your toddler was not welcome when informed by the host.  Should the host have stated\n\u201cno children\u201d in their invitation?  Emphatically, yes. However, it is your responsibility, as the steward of your child, to ensure that they are welcome and properly behaved in the given circumstance.",

When regarding babies, kids and parties (especially sports parties) you always ask. Always always always always even if it's a kids party you always make sure they are welcome before you show up.
