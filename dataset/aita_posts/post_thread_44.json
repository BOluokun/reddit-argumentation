  "post content": "A couple years ago, a close friend, Ashley, started a long-distance relationship with a guy, Chris. He has been really good to her and after meeting in person a few times, they decided to move in together. I was super happy for her as she had a few bad relationships over the years and it was nice to see her in a healthy one. That joy faded the last couple months before she moved a few states over to be with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe issue isn't her moving, but that she repeatedly joked about having a baby from Chris. At first, I accepted it as jokes, but over time I realized Ashley was serious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor context, Ashley has two children from a previous previous relationship, ages 10 and 12. Chris absolutely doesn't want kids. He told her this at the start and anytime she hinted possibly wanting more, he shot it down, saying it was a deal breaker. Now, Chris is more than willing to accept her children as her own, because he loves her and after meeting her kids, them as well. He's accepted that they are a package deal with her, and since they are at an age where they are semi-independent, it's not an issue for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me, Chris is a real bro for taking on her kids without issue. Hearing Ashley say she wants a baby out of him, \"one way or another\", bothered me to no end. It's hard enough to find a partner that treats you well and accepts children that aren't their own. To find one that does and then talk about plotting to force a baby seems gross and manipulative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore her move, I had sat down with Ashley, trying to talk sense into her. At first she resisted, but finally it seemed she understood how shitty it would be. After I felt like she had understood, I put the issue behind me and helped support her thru the hassle of moving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few days after she left, I got a call from a mutual friend who delves into the Wiccan/Metaphysical realm. She was distraught and confessed to me that shortly before Ashley's move, Ashley had come to her asking for a fertility spell. This friend didn't feel comfortable about it and refused. When pushed, she said she cast a spell for a healthy and honest relationship, but told Ashley it was for fertility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can imagine, I was livid. I messaged Ashley, confronting her about what I learned and she laughed it off as she was desperate, but magic is fake anyway, so what's the harm? She then let it slip, that since Chris was planning on getting a vasectomy in a few months, she had poked holes in their condoms as a last ditch effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt that point, I couldn't stay silent. I gathered up screenshots of all the conversations over the last few months and sent them to Chris. He understandably freaked out and kicked her out. Now, Ashley hates me because she was kicked out after a huge move and didn't have a job or money to make it back. She said I'm a terrible person for putting her and her kids out on the street.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here? Should I have kept quiet?",

Poking holes in condoms is rape, you've changed the consent levels and it's fucking rape.\n\nAs a note, I am a woman and if a man was poking holes in condoms to make a baby with me I would consider it rape. It is the same in a woman doing so with a man. Baby-trapping is fucking rape and it's not okay. She deserves to be kicked out, if it's after an expensive move, that's her own damn fault.\n\nOp, you saved a man from an abusive relationship after he gave so much already to accept her kids while being childfree. You saved him, she is absolute dogshit.\n\nEdit: a couple awards I've gotten state that it should be considered assault. I mean, yes. But also rape. \n\nYes, the big R-word. Rape is rape. I am a rather militant feminist, if a man were poking holes in the condom to trap a woman in to a reproductive-based relationship, it would absolutely be considered rape. The woman doing it is exactly the same. He did not consent to what at this point is essentially bare-backing. He didn't consent to all levels of this sexual encounter, in fact with his choice to use a condom he explicitly did not consent to the sexual encounter being reproductive. She made that choice against his consent, and thus it's rape. \n\nIt's really, really not difficult to understand. He didn't want a baby, he wore a condom to prevent that, she wanted a baby and knew he didn't so she sabotaged the condoms. She is a rapist. He did not consent.",

The legal definition is highly variable by country, state/region, and even city.\n\nSome places still do not enable women to be charged with rape. Some only will charge a male victim's rapist if he was penetrated. Typically a lessor crime is used, sometimes even just a misdemeanor battery/assault. In some places women cannot be charged with anything basically, as \"intercourse is only possible if the man is hard, and if the man is hard it means he wanted it\".\n\nThe issue for a lot of places is that the legal definition of rape involved penetration of the victim. Luckily more and more places are broadening the definition of rape to include really anything sexual that was not consented to. Some areas are just adding more potential crimes to the legal guidelines like reproductive coercion.\n\nReproductive coercion (rape) is scary as hell. It is just so unbelievably shitty. All rape is horrid, but the notion that someone thinks it is okay to trick someone into having a child is abhorrent, regardless of whether you are female or male. \n\nA woman could roofie a guy, rape him, get pregnant, and then demand child support for the next 18 years. From what I've read being raped is not a defense to get out of child support. Courts do not care about circumstance, only that two individuals provide financial support to the child.",
