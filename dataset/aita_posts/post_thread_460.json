  "post content": "So earlier this week I had a very unsettling human exchange with someone on my flight from Los Angeles to New York and it\u2019s been plaguing me that I still feel so annoyed by it. Looking to calm myself down by someone either confirming these women were rude or telling me I\u2019m the a-hole. \n\nGot a flight from LAX to JFK this past Wednesday. I have a deeply sprained ankle and am wearing a giant aircast. Everyone sees me and my cast hobbling along to aisle to my seat (hard to be subtle with a giant plastic boot) because I was the literal last person to board. \n\nI take my seat next to a nice gentleman. I\u2019m ready to pass out for the flight by reading my book. Right before we take off, a female runs back to the man sitting next to me and says \u201cno one is sitting next to me! They never showed up - come sit with me!\u201d So the man leaves and sits next to who I can only assume is his girlfriend or sister. \n\nI\u2019m thinking I must\u2019ve done something great in my past life to have deserved such luck!! Now I have no one sitting next to me and can elevate my foot during the flight, since I\u2019m prone to blood clots and was worried. \n\nHowever, almost immediately once the gentleman leaves, the woman across the aisle leans over and asks \u201cdid that man just leave?!?\u201d, so I nod curtly and begin spreading my leg out, aircast and all and nodding off to sleep. I was hoping she would get the hint that just because there was an open seat next to me, didn\u2019t mean I wanted to share it. \n\nI\u2019m awoken by this woman\u2019s friend standing above me, with the women across the aisle, staring straight at me, saying \u201cmy friend is going to sit here.\u201d \n\nI was super disorientated upon waking so I just started adjusting myself and the woman took her new seat without a word. Once she is settled, she points at my boot and asks \u201cdid you just have surgery?\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m so irked by her audacity to recognize my cast and my discomfort and also bluntly disregard her contribution to my discomfort. \n\nEdited to include here: once I full woke up, I leaned to the woman across the aisle and told her she was rude for not asking me if her friend could sit there and for disregarding my leg and cast. She simply said \u201cokay\u201d and I didn\u2019t push it any further. \n\nI\u2019ve spent days so taken aback by this exchange. I know I was always going to have to sit next to another person, but I feel as if I had a stroke of good luck that someone stole from me. \n\nAm I being the asshole or am I right for thinking those ladies should have minded their business and let me have my seat to myself?",

Air travel can be challenging enough and by the time people get to the plane after traffic, parking, security lines - they\u2019re often times crabby. If I have the power to make someone\u2019s flight better, why wouldn\u2019t I? If I see a mom or dad flying alone, they get extra attention and I\u2019ll move them to a seat with more room. If it\u2019s economy, cool. If it\u2019s premium, even better. It\u2019s no money out of my pocket so I\u2019m not going to flex my muscles just because I can. My airline is totally fine with comping as long as we can justify it.",

So even if you pulled aside a flight attendant and demanded they step in and force everyone back to their original seats, you still would have had some next to you. It would have been nice\n\nEven if you'd started with the entire row, which you did not, the airline is also at perfect liberty to put someone next to you. People get moved around all the time for various reasons, including allergies, discomfort, mobility issues. As a matter of fact, depending on how full the flight was and how nicely you asked, you might have been able to ask a flight attendant to move you to an empty row. But instead you chose to take it out on some random woman.",

So I think she was inconsiderate and rude enough to be a bit of an asshole. On the other hand, I\u2019m not sure you should have clapped back. I think this leaves me at ESH but very gently.
