  "post content": "So recently I've uninvited my brother(29) to my wedding after his behaviour with regards to inheritance from our recently departed grandmother. \n\nOur grandmother died (it sucks but was expected) and I sh*t you not 2 days after she had died, he's \"explaining\" to me how much inheritance we are getting. This was also my mother's birthday. Literally 2 days afterwards. \n\nHe'd googled the price of her assets and looked at the will (not because he was asked to but he wanted to see what he was getting) and \"done the maths\"\nAfter pointing out how disgusting his behaviour was I excused myself and left as I don't have time for that. \n\nFast forward to a group chat created by another brother to try and smooth things out before the funeral. This did not go as planned for that brother. Within 10 minutes I'd been told I need to to get both sides of the story but it's ok because I'm getting married so I can say as I please.\n\nI'm a very black and white kind of person, I say things how I see them and if I offend someone, well then be offended. At no point had I provoked him yet me getting married clearly was a cheap shot from him and that didn't sit right with me. So I told him where to stick it and while he's there to throw my wedding invite out.\n\nNow fast forward again to the day of the funeral. Family members are telling me to clear the air. How our grandmother wouldn't want this.  Normal guilt tripping stuff. \n\nAt no point had he made an effort to even attempt to justify his sh*tty behaviour but here at the funeral I'm the bad guy for uninviting him? Both of my grandparents would be turning in their graves if they could see how he is acting. \n\nSo AITA for uninviting him? Most of my family think I am\n\nEdit: Out of all my brother's (5 in total) we have the least communication between all of us. His behaviour over the years has never been great (committed fraud with other family members ID and that's barely the start) but the moment our grandmother passed he was all of her things. The cheap shot about how I can say as I please as I'm getting married made no sense but it was the final straw for me.\n\nEdit 2: After speaking to my mother this morning I have just found out he has taken a loan out with the intention of paying it off with his inheritance. We buried my grandmother 3 days ago. \n\nEdit 3: This is one of many issues over the years on this side of the family. They have always been drawn towards drama and as we've gotten older I mainly see most of them at funerals and weddings. Our uncle wasn't involved in the funeral because he'd been arrested for breaking into our grandmother's. I hate the drama and I don't want to be a part of it.",

She just lost her mother. That\u2019s a different kind of hurt. Yeah he\u2019s saying the quiet part out loud that many people are usually all over the inheritance when someone passes. Especially those who are in desperate money situations. But this is one of those times that its quiet for a reason.
