  "post content": "\n\nI used to have a german shepard named \"Willy\", but had to put him up for adoption because my future stepson is allergic to dogs so Willy had to be out of the house before my fiancee and her son moved in with me.\n\nNgl, I did feel like I'd given up on Willy, I've had him since he was small but I did thorough digging to find him the perfect home and the perfect family. I'd met up with the family and they embraced him right away, they seemed nice and all and agreed to keep in contact so I could learn about how willy's doing.\n\nThis took place in december, I got busy with the holidays then loads and loads of work and was only able to call the family to check on Willy last week. Anyways so while I was with them on the phone I heard a small girl yelling \"Rudy\" repeatedly, I asked who Rudy was and they casually said it was Willy but they gave him a new name. I was absolutely shocked I asked if they were being serious with me and they asked what's wrong. I absolutely lost it on them telling them that that dog already has a name that was given to him by his owner and they should respect that. Pluse all his legal papers are under the name Willy but I was surprised when they said they took care of that legally...like how... I told them they had no permission from to rename the dog point blank period. but they argued that willy is theirs now and I have no say, I told them they were dead wrong and demanded that they have some respect and stop confusing him and start calling him with his real name. They refused and we got into a huge fight on the phone and social media where they threatened to block me. I was so mad I took the argument to their place where they threatened to report me for \"harrasement\". I decided to take few days to let things settle down then I'd visit them again but my fiancee thinks I'm overstepping and should let the family decide this stuff without harrassing them which was an expected thing to hear from her since my stepson is the reason I had to let of my dog in the first place. She got offended but I told her that siding with strangers mistreating my dog did not paint her in good light though I started thinking she might be right.\n\nSo AITA?",

She got offended but I told her that siding with strangers mistreating my dog did not paint her in good light\n\nHow is your fianc\u00e9e asking you not to harass the dog's new owner over a name remotely related to her son being the reason you felt obligated to give the dog up? Isn't it more likely she just thinks you shouldn't harass people in general, nothing to do with her son or the dog? Similarly, how could you possibly spin these people renaming *their* newly adopted dog (read: not your dog) as mistreatment? And then you try to position that as a strike against your fianc\u00e9es character, as if she supports the mistreatment of dogs, just because she's telling you to back off the name issue? \n\nTo a reasonable person, this all sounds like your fianc\u00e9e is encouraging you to think logically at a time when you are letting your emotions get the better of you. You chose to give up your dog in the interest of your relationship with your fiancee and her son. That dog that was once yours now belongs to someone else, and his new life (including what they choose to call him) is none of your business. (Frankly, you were lucky they were kind enough to keep in touch and provide post-adoption updates at all; now you're just lucky they haven't taken out a restraining order.)\n\nMy point is, you've only managed to imagine the connections you've made here because of your own misdirected bitterness at the situation. Your fianc\u00e9e is exactly right, and it's sad that you're so determined to make her the enemy in all this.",
