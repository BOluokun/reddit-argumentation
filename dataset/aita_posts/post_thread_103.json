  "post content": "My mother-in-law watches my three kids.  They are age 5, 3 and 7 months.  My mother-in-law usually watches them and drops them off from school. The kids are battling a stomach virus so everyone was home on Monday. \n\nThe little one had a poop explosion so my mother-in-law washed her butt in our bathroom sink.  However, she did not clean up after and there was poop all around the sink, on the toothpaste, on the toothbrushes and the little cups that the kids use when brushing their teeth.  I have pictures if you guys really want to see.\n\nThis has happened before but it's the first time we said anything. When my wife called her mom to be more careful because it's absolutely disgusting and gross.  My wife is Hispanic so her tone can definitely be aggressive, especially to a gringo like myself, but her mom seemed to understand the frustration. However, once her sisters (both in their 30s and single for good reason) caught wind that my wife 'belittled' their mother all hell broke loose.  The sisters began defending the mother, calling out how dirty/messy our house is, calling my wife fat and basically just saying how lucky we are to have the MIL in our life and it's no big deal. In fact, were the a-holes for being upset about this. \n\nI guess the sisters got to my mother-in-law because then MIL came back and started parroting the same talking points about how messy our house is, how ungrateful my wife is and how my MIL cleans our house and cooks for the kids all of the time. My 5 year old son was also at her house this weekend and had an accident where he hershey squirted on the bed cuz he's sick That was also thrown in our face multiple times. They also referred to watching our kids as FAVORS which is weird because they always ask to take them. \n\nMy mother-in-law says she won't come ever again to watch the kids. She no showed today so I had to call out today to watch the baby which is fine.  However, I don't like how the MIL is affecting my job and career with her pettiness as I had some important stuff scheduled today. Keep in mind, we pay her $300 (cash) a week to watch the kids.  Now I'm going to pay about $150 more per month for someone to watch the kids which is no big deal really.\n\nHowever, my son's birthday is tomorrow. They had a big ol party planned at my mother-in-laws for Saturday. However, I have told everyone that we will not be attending the party and we have barred her family from seeing, giving gifts or even speaking to the kids for the time being. \n\nAITA for cancelling my son's party and not allowing my wife's family to celebrate his birthday on Saturday?",

Your kids could have gotten sick from her behavior.  Oh, wait, they are.  Hmm.\n\nYour kids are sick, and the mess they make is somehow your fault when MIL is the one doing the caregiving?  No.  It's not. \n\nThis isn't the first time such things have happened?  \n\nGet better caregivers.  MIL isn't competent.  If she can't prioritize safety issues like cleaning up after such things happen, she's not being safe for your children.  Makes me wonder how often they have gotten sick because of her unsafe lack of cleanliness.\n\nWhen your wife complained about MIL's incompetence in childcare, MIL went out and got herself some enablers to support her incompetence?  And they attacked your wife and you, insulted you both, etc.?   \n\nNTA.  This is about not spending time with the people that blame and insult you for the things that someone else did.  They behaved badly, and are blaming you.  That's not people who are healthy to have around your children.  I wouldn't want to have them around to do more of the same thing on your child's birthday, either.  \n\nProtecting your child and having a birthday that doesn't include people that blame you for the behavior of your MIL, that's just being a good parent.  Having such people around for a birthday would spoil the birthday.  And it would teach your children to blame others for their own behaviors.",

So, she's getting as fair pay for her work as many nannies do. Hourly pay for nannies is between $7.25/hr and $20/hr based on a quick search I just did, so, while it's on the low end, it's within the standard range. This is no \"favor\" she's doing. It's a job she's getting paid typical wage for and, in that role, she should absolutely be expected to maintain some basic health and safety standards for those kids. \n\nAlso, OP very clearly has a norovirus rotating through their children, likely because MIL isn't cleaning up properly after accidents. When a norovirus is going through a household, bathroom areas need to be cleaned with bleach frequently and regularly, even when there aren't accidents.

C. diff is a thing and I can guarantee you that your kids will be vulnerable to it if they need antibiotics and she continues to take care of them. \n\nIs it common outside of hospital or long term care settings? No. But that doesn't mean it's *never* acquired outside of the hospital. A *lot* of people have C. diff in their digestive tract naturally. It generally only becomes a problem when antibiotics kick your digestive flora out of whack. (There are other ways to get it, but that's the major cause of it.) If your MIL is not taking care of your kids' asses properly, do you really trust her to be washing her hands after she shits? \n\nI had C. diff when I was in a nursing home for rehab when I had my back fused and it is *absolutely horrible*. You think a baby blowout is bad? Imagine a massive baby blowout like 6+ times a day, but with the smell of Satan's asscrack in the middle of July. It is *not fun* and leaves you at *serious* risk of dehydration, at the very least. I cannot imagine what that would feel like for a poor child. \n\nAlso, C. diff is *highly* contagious. Everyone who came in to see me while I had it was completely covered up with protective pants, gowns, gloves, and masks -- imagine what people wear when they treat COVID patients -- and all that went into the trash when they left. So if she passes it on, it's entirely possible that your whole family could end up with it.\n\nStand your ground and *do not* let this woman take care of your children.
