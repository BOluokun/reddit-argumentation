  "post content": "I20f have been with my bf for almost 3 months. I just started staying at his apartment recently for overnights. He\u2019s my first real boyfriend.\n\nI live at home with my family still and we\u2019re very open. I walk around in a shirt and my underwear majority of the time, and it\u2019s not an all girls house hold. I have a dad, and two brothers ages 17 and 14. I also did it growing up and I also have an older brother. If guest stopped by un announced growing up so be it, they\u2019d see us in our bedwear. It\u2019s just the normal for me, and I guess I expected other people to do it.\n\nAs you could probably imagine, I did this at my boyfriends apartment when it was just the two of us, which he loved. Then two days ago his brother stopped by and I came out of the shower in a t shirt and cheakies underwear(but not too cheakies it only exposed a little.) When my bf saw me he immediately whispered to me to put on some pants which I did. After his brother left he was super pissed an asked if I was trying to \u201cseduce his brother or something.\u201d I told him I didn\u2019t mean anything by it, just that at home I walk around like this, and he said well not at his home and not when we have guest. He told me I looked like I was trying to \u201cstrut it for his brother.\u201d I apologized but he was super upset and went to sleep early, which isn\u2019t like our normal sleepovers since I stay over so rarely. \n\nIt\u2019s been 3 days and he hasn\u2019t asked me to sleepover again. Aita?",

If anyone \u2014 guy or girl \u2014 wandered around in cheekies (or a thong) while a guest was present, I think it\u2019d be cause for some concern. In this case, if she was wearing boxers instead, it *might* be different cause they\u2019re less form-fitting, less revealing, etc. Speaking personally, I\u2019d be less self-conscious walking around friends and family in boxers than I would tighty-whities for the reasons above. Some articles of clothing are more revealing than others, and consequently have more of an association with \u201ctrying to be sexy\u201d. Or improper, gross, etc. \n\nContext is also important. Most people wear their underwear when they\u2019re comfortable (like when they\u2019re around people who are used to seeing them in their underwear \u2014 or less), so me and my wife wear less clothing when home alone, even if we\u2019re not playing at having sex. But if someone\u2019s stopping by, we throw on more clothes. \n\nAlternatively, if a *group* of people are taking an impromptu dip in the lake and don\u2019t have swimwear, yeah, maybe the girl(s) would strip down to their underwear and a tank top and it not be sexual. That\u2019s not to say someone there might not *sexualize* them, but that\u2019s a slightly different thing. Same thing if a dude decided to wander out of the bedroom in a thong during a family/friend gathering because he thought it\u2019d be gross/good for a laugh. Some people might laugh, others might be uncomfortable. \n\nFor *her*, what she is wearing isn\u2019t an issue, but I don\u2019t think she is representative of what is considered socially acceptable. She just hasn\u2019t had the experience \u2014 until now \u2014 where she was made aware that a lot (most?) people would find what she wore, in that specific context, as unusual.",

Around his roommate/guests/his family? No, that\u2019s weird. Same way I would find it weird if we were staying with my parents/siblings and he walked around in his underwear, that would be weird. \n\nWhen we\u2019ve visited my family, he throws gym shorts on before heading down for coffee. I\u2019d throw on pj shorts or gym shorts if I was around his family too. \n\nBut I think the big thing here is, around family/in your own home, you and your family can decide what you\u2019re comfortable with. Don\u2019t do it at your boyfriends place around his family/friends/roommates. It\u2019s not hard to throw on some pj shorts or gym shorts, or keep a bathrobe handy. OP could even ask to keep a spare bathrobe or some gym shorts at his place if she\u2019s over there a lot. \n\nOP - sorry but YTA. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to talk to your boyfriend, clear the air, and come up with a solution. Maybe he gives you a heads up if someone is coming over and you\u2019re there, and maybe you could keep some sweatpants or shorts over there for when you spend the night.",

It's not the most common mentality, at least not in the US, but it's what you grew up knowing apparently. \n\nYour boyfriend is going to feel the way he feels about it, and you can't help that. All you can really do is just assure him that it was naivety and how you grew up, not a seductive or malicious predatory move, and move forward, of course with the understanding that with your boyfriend, company over means covering up. This isn't to downplay what you're comfortable with, but if company is coming over to his house, they are also more likely to share his sentiments with comfort-levels regarding clothing as well, so it's more of a benefit to all parties involved. If it is a dealbreaker, though, you're young and it's early in the relationship, you can go your own way if you need to. Somehow, though, I don't imagine a little misunderstanding like this would be cause for a dealbreaker on your end.",

A body is not sexual. Actions are. Was she prancing around and trying to give him a thrill?
