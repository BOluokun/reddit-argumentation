  "post content": "My brother was getting married, and it was a child-free wedding per future SIL's request. The wedding was out of state so my husband and I were going to make it into a three-day weekend. We had a sitter lined up months ago. The day before we were set to leave she had to cancel for a family emergency. We tried to find a last-minute sitter that we trusted and could also do just overnight but came up empty. I tried calling and texting my brother about the situation but couldn't get hold of him. We were both in the wedding party and I didn't want to leave my brother and his soon-to-be-wife in a bind. So I called my mother after that since I knew she was with them. I explained the situation and she said she'd call me back after talking to him.\n\nFour hours pass and we didn't hear back. We had to make a decision, and since we are currently sharing one vehicle couldn't really leave my husband and kid without a vehicle, and had put a lot of money already into the wedding and trip, we just took our baby with us. We got there later than we originally planned and just went to our room. The next afternoon was the wedding, and my husband and I planned to swap time out- I'd go the ceremony and part of the reception while he stayed with the baby, and he could attend the second half the reception while I stayed with the baby. When the ceremony was over and we were heading inside to the reception, my husband had the baby inside in her stroller. I joined my husband and went to say hello to some family members, and went with him to congratulate my brother and new SIL. Husband said his hellos and congrats, then went back to our room with our child.\n\nI left the reception area a few times to bring my husband some small plates of food so he didn't have to wait for his turn to eat. On one of my trips back my brother spoke with me about it being a child-free wedding and his wife was upset that my husband had the baby in the lobby and that I kept leaving the reception. I told him they can't be too upset because we didn't bring the baby into the wedding area or the reception. The rest of the time I was at the reception I kept getting comments from who I'm guessing were SIL's family and her bridesmaids about how I was trying to steal her thunder by having my baby there. SIL kept asking why I didn't just leave them at home and would not accept my reason for not doing so.\n\nIt's been a sore spot for my family and her all weekend. Am I an A-hole for bringing the baby with us?\n\nInfo: The wedding ceremony itself was outside in a courtyard, it was not in a closed-off area. We had to go through the lobby area to get to the reception hall. My husband was in the lobby walking with the baby and getting coffee from the hotel shop.",
