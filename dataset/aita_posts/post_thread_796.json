Please read that again. \n\nWhat I said was IM SURE YOUVE HEARD OF PARENTS WHO CALL THE COPS ON THEIR ABUSIVE KIDS. \n\nReading comprehension is a skill. Please learn it. And anecdotally, I know of two people who did just that. One was a single mother whose son always wanted to fight her or will swear at her when she asked him to help around the house or scolded him for neglecting his studies. She called the cops on him after he smashed in a wall and scared his little brother(5 at the time to this man\u2019s 17). He spent 2 weeks in juvie and kept calling his mum to come get him. Sadly for him, he turned 18 in juvie and the mum told him he had to get out of her house because his little brother would just cry when he came into the room where the 5yr old was. Last I heard, he crawled back home begging for forgiveness recently because it took him 6 years to get a college degree and this is the worst possible time to be in the job market. \nSo, yes it happens.",
