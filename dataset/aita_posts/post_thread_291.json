  "post content": "Daughter is 16. Her mom and I are divorced.Daughter has been caught smoking pot several times from the age of 14. Her mom and I have collectively punished her several times for this. The last time we caught her, I started drug testing her. Her mom doesn\u2019t agree with it, but we have caught her so many times now that I think this is the best way to prevent her from doing it.\n\nI don\u2018t normally go through her room, but the router for the house is in there, and I needed to reset it. When I go into her room, I found a mushroom cap on black paper hidden underneath her desk. I look up what the hell it is and it is a spore print for magic mushrooms. I go through her room further to find an entire damn aqarium filled with mushrooms in the back of her closet. obviously I am enraged, so I wait for her to get back from school, and I called the police. She was arrested, booked and released into her mother\u2019s custody.\n\nHer mother is pissed, and saying that I may have ruined the kids life for no reason, but we have tried to correct her drug abuse several times to no avail, and it has escalated. She now has a court date and can answer to the law since she doesn\u2019t take the rules in my house seriously. I doubt she\u2019ll get more than probation anyway.\n\nMy parents are also pissed though, saying that this could have been handled inside the home, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m wondering if I over reacted and would like a more impartial judgment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am making and edit to respond to a few things.\n\nThis was a small ten gallon tank. I guess people are picturing something larger. There were a lot of mushrooms in there though. My daughter has a small walk in closet that is, honestly, so messy that I don\u2019t bother to look in there too much. Because she has been passing her drug tests, I have been cutting her slack. I honestly would not have called the police if I thought that she was going to get a jail sentence at all.",

I was at one point deprived of safe water supply for a period of several days, and forbidden to drink from unsafe streams.

The infected wounds from hip and shoulder belts, and the feet so swollen I could barely walk helped, I'm sure.

I left my last boyfriend because of that shit - because he wasn't willing to seek actual help for his issues beyond \"pot makes me feel good for an hour so I'm just gonna constantly be so high I don't have to worry about functioning in the real world.\" Do you know how difficult and emotionally taxing it can be to be in a relationship with someone like that? \n\nIt's not good for your mental health to depend on a self-diagnosed \"cure\". It would be one thing if these people were prescribed marijuana to help with their anxiety but some of these people were straight up told by their doctors and therapists to STOP smoking because it was becoming more of a crutch than a legitimate treatment. \n\nIf you have an addictive personality, you can get addicted to *anything* that gives you an escape from the real world and your problems.

My parents would constantly snoop and make up lies about it, or do abusive shit and then try and cover it up with insane nonsensical narratives.

Id like to preface this by saying I dont think smoking pot makes you a drug addict but there have been studies that shown drug use negatively impacts development of teens and kids. This kid isnt just smoking pot once in a while, they're commiting a felony growing ~~a schedule 1 substance~~ shrooms in their house. That definitely crosses a line.\n\nAll that being said, there are so many people completely out of touch with how the world works. This isnt some over controlling parent trying to control their kid. This is a parent who's tried doing everything in their power to stop their kids escalating relationship with drugs.\n\nOPs already tried to deal with his daughter's drug problem by keeping it in-house and in the family. He event tried therapy which his daughter is actively rejecting. None of this worked and her behavior has escalated to growing a schedule 1 controlled substance in the house. So what we he supposed to do after catching her growing mushrooms, punish her again? That's shown to have no effect on her.\n\nOften the only time when people with drug problems stop abusing is when they get a wake up call. Clearly parental intervention wasn't enough. Shes also a minor so this is the best time for her to face legal consequences as theres a high chance it wont stick on her permanent record.\n\nI feel like a lot of people dont know that in most states, most first timer minor drug offenders get placed in court mandated rehab programs. A lot of people in the comments are acting like OP just sent her straight to prison without trying anything else when in the comments OP has said hes tried various therapy options as well as more standard punishments.\n\nEvery day I become more convinced that the majority of people in this sub are teenagers who have no idea how things work in the real world.\n\nEdit: because I'm getting tired about repeating this, this isnt about the drugs she was doing, it's about the relationship she has with them that's caused her to commit a felony to get them after pursuing drug use for 2 years despite the consequences. That's an unhealthy relationship at best and abuse at worst. Yes, pot and shrooms can still be abused even though they aren't addictive.",

My parents did the same as OP and called the cops on me but luckily I Ubered to the first rehab I found on Google before they could arrest me.\n\n What I've learnt is that addiction in general is not spontaneous, and repeated addiction - an addictive personality - is a strong sign of addict trying to fill an emotional hole left behind by his/her parents. My mother divorced twice and her second husband was physically and emotionally abusive and was also showed favouritism to all my siblings. My mom divorced him and her new \"boyfriend\" physically abused her, sometimes in front of me. \n\nI would imagine that OP did not bother to add any information that wouldve definitely antagonized himself, like the way he was raising his daughter or the mental effects the divorce had on her. Perhaps the reason for the divorce would also shed a bit of light on the possible triggers for such an addictive personality.\n\nSelf-righteous parents such as yourselves who respond with NTA cannot take responsibility for the way their kids turn out. Only if your kid is getting good grades and has good ambitions or lifestyle then that's because you raised correctly, but if they are addicts and are bad apples then it's not your fault. At the very least everyone should be responding with INFO to try and understand the underlying issue involved. \n\nFor a child at SIXTEEN to be so heavily involved with drugs is a strong indicator that there is an underlying emotional wound. You think you know how the real world works? You have never suffered with true addiction.",

The most important thing is that OPs daughter needs to feel supported and given OPs actions she probably doesn't right now.",
