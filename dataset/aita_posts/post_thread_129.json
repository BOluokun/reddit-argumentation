  "post content": "I (32F) grew up in a low income household and was determined from an early age to start investing and owning real estate.  I graduated from pharmacy school with minimal debt and bought my first rental property. I currently own 4 rental properties with my fianc\u00e9. We both learned how to remodel and fix basic things to keep costs low. We use the rental property money to invest in stocks and looking into buying a 5th property. \n\nMy best friend (32F) of 15 years has been married to her husband for 3 years and they have 1 child and 1 on the way. Their landlord has decided to evict them. He has given them 60 days to find a new place. They have asked if they could live in one of my rental properties.\n\nThe problem is they are not very clean people and that is one of the main reasons for their eviction. My friend has 4 cats and they pee EVERYWHERE. On their clothes, sofa and beds. They also tend to scratch the walls and  cabinets. She just says it\u2019s just because they\u2019re a*holes. Their current home is on the brink of being on a hoarders episode. Her husband spends his free time playing video games and does not try to help in cleaning or doing any \u201cwoman\u201d chores. \n\nMy friend has also asked if we could give her a discount on the rent since they are about to have their 2nd baby.  Both of them work but my friend\u2019s job  will not pay her the whole time she is on maternity leave. \n\nI told her I could give her a temporary reduction on the rent but she would not be allowed to have the cats. She said they are like her children and could not get rid of them. She said that would be like asking to get rid of her human children and I am the a*hole for even suggesting it. I told her those were my stipulations. I have been fortunate that my tenants with pets are respectful and clean up religiously after them. \n\nShe currently is not talking to me and telling our other friends that it\u2019s my fault she is about homeless. A couple of friends have said I should make an exception but  I\u2019ve put so much time and money into these homes. So am I the asshole for telling my friend she can\u2019t move in with her cats?",

It was a property on a berry farm so it wasn\u2019t the worst thing at first. She had 2 goats and some dogs. The first issue was her tying the goat to the pear tree and him eating or ramming into it ended up killing the tree. She also randomly trimmed them almost to the trunk without permission. By the time they moved out there were 4 cats that were shut up in a small bedroom because they were half feral strays and their geriatric dog had had accidents everywhere that weren\u2019t properly cleaned. And the house was so infested with fleas that within 30 seconds of walking in, your shins would visibly be COVERED in them. And of course they were worse in the back corner room where the cats were. So almost the farthest point from the entryway",

His asshole nature comes in his interactions with people.\n\nNot only are they horrible pet owners, but they have no respect for anything, even themselves, esp their children if they plan to raise their human children in the filth their furry children leave behind.\n\nIt sounds like your friendship is over, unfortunately, if they value you as a friend for only what you can do for them, and that's a transactional relationship, not a friendship.\n\nIt's up to you if you explain your reasons to your in common friends but you are in no way TA here.",

You know renting to her will end badly.  So lose a friend now, or lose her later after she has destroyed your house and stuck you with $$$$ in damages.  You made the right choice.",
