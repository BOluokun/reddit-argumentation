  "post content": "Firstly sorry this is on mobile and throwaway.\n\nI (F32) emigrated to my husband\u2019s (39) home country 5 years ago and we have a beautiful son who is 3. \n\nMy mother (52) has always been controlling and frankly is a typical narcissist. She was dead against my moving and was even more upset when I had my son as a combination of her husband being terminally ill and the pandemic she wasn\u2019t able to meet my son until this week and she has complained bitterly how we \u201ccheated\u201d her out of her special time with her first grandson. \n\nI wasn\u2019t exactly excited about her coming to visit us but my husband convinced me we should try to let our son have a relationship with her. Well from the moment she arrived she complained - our house is too small, the garden is over looked etc. She complained my son doesn\u2019t speak much english and so she can\u2019t communicate with him. She complained that my son didn\u2019t want to hug her, that he wanted to stay with his paternal grandmother.\n\nMy son spilt a drink and she shouted at him. We are taking the gentle approach so I told her not to do that and why and she lost it telling me I have no idea how to raise a kid. I told her she needs to respect my methods or she can leave. She stopped but the whole rest of the day you could tell she was furious.\n\nThat night my son was having one of those nights where he just isn\u2019t going to sleep through. My poor husband also had an IBS flare up in the early hours and we realised we had no medication.\n\nWhen my son settled at around 7:30am I decided to do a quick run to the 24hour pharmacy to get some medication. Leaving son and husband both asleep on the sofa.\n\nI was gone for 20mins but when I came back my mother\u2019s rental car was gone and so was my son while my husband was still asleep. He was as shocked as I was they had gone.\n\nTried my mother\u2019s mobile but no answer. After 45mins of me becoming increasingly hysterical I called the police who came out very fast and when I explained as above took things seriously.\n\n6hours later my mother pulled back up and started telling the police (most adults know english here) that I had told her she could take my son out for the day, I am currently 6 months pregnant and she said it must be pregnancy brain which the police seemed to accept and acted like the matter was closed since my son was home safely and showing everyone the toys he been bought. \n\nI told my mother to leave and that I never want to see her again. She started telling family I kicked her out for no reason and she can\u2019t find a hotel and they blew up my phone to which I told them she had kidnapped my son and I am going to pursue this with the police.\n\nNow I am being called an a-hole for saying my son was kidnapped when he was \u201cjust taken on a day trip by his loving grandmother\u201d and that a accusation like this could affect my mother\u2019s job as a nurse.\n\nEdit - lots of people saying my husband shouldn\u2019t have pushed for this meeting. You are right but I don\u2019t think he was wrong. He didn\u2019t force me to agree to it, I ultimately had the final say. \n\nAnd I get it he is (we are) lucky his parents are amazing so despite knowing my mother isn\u2019t great he didn\u2019t want our son to miss out. We expected some snide comments and awkwardness but were ready to ignore that for our son. Since my mother\u2019s normal weapon of choice is nasty comments he wouldn\u2019t understand so if we kept smiling he wouldn\u2019t know.\n\nI feel grief that my son is going \u201cmiss out\u201d on having another grandmother but she made her bed.\n\nEdit 2 (holy s**t is this real life) So she is now trying to change the narrative to \u201cI did not kidnap your son but also if you think your husband could just sleep through an abduction then your marriage is a sham/how could you be so reckless to leave your child with him@\n\nI can not even with this.\n\n\nUpdate (of sorts) thank you everyone for the support. It seems maybe I got a bit lost in my translation (emotional and the police spoke native language and very fast with strong accents) the case isn\u2019t exactly dropped. \n\nThey have spoken to my mother and basically told her not to approach the house or they will consider it a threat/harassment and will act while they \u201ccontinue investigating\u201d but they feel her leaving the country tomorrow is enough of a resolution (apparently she has shown ticket info).\n\nI am still getting a lot of grief from family saying I should understand my mother is struggling after her husband died and so on\u2026.this again is making me question my reaction but I can\u2019t forgive this. \n\nI will reach out relative embassies but I feel like nothing will happen. \n\nMy partners family are being amazing and looking after us all.",

If any licensed or unlicensed individual has any hope for becoming employed in my state that may have access to, directly or indirectly to protected individuals, our state runs a check against this as well as DHS, DSS,DCF,AID formally known as OPA. These agencies report and run with state and federal agencies as well. So even if you work in a cafeteria in a CT school, you'll be checked to make sure this individual has never been convicted of abuse, neglect, misconduct with patients ect. All kinds of stuff can land you on this list.  And different offenses keep you on the \"list\" for mandated different amounts of time. In hopes that it helps prevent agency hoppers, in n out of CT from offending protected individuals time and time again. \nYou would bet, if this grandma gets charged, the police and prosecutors will make sure if her state has a registry, she will be on it and the state licensing board for her state will also revoke and remove any further licenses she may have. They can also prevent you from EVER becoming a nurse again!!\nIf you want to volunteer at your child's school in CT, they also require, even if you're the parent and it's your child's class  You want to volunteer with, you will also undergo this same background check because the access to children is there.",

Did she even have a car seat/booster seat for him? Is that required by law where you are? \n\nYou just keep on telling everyone the plain facts, very clearly. There's no need to exaggerate or get super emotional because the facts themselves are so damning (*\"She took our toddler away in her rental car, without our permission, and went god knows where with him for six hours: no text, no call, nothing. For all we knew, they were dead in a ditch somewhere. Then she came back and said she had done nothing wrong. That's why she's banned from our house forever.\"*)\n\nIf the police won't take your criminal complaint seriously, that sucks. But there must be a civil process where you can swear an affidavit or provide in-person evidence, and ask for a restraining order against this person? Once you get that, it will speak for itself. And feel free to provide it to the Board or College that licences nurses in her home country -- people with no boundaries or conscience should not be nurses, eh?\n\nAs for the \"faaamily\" pecking at you: tell the truth, fearlessly, and if they are still dumb enough to take crazy grandma's side... well, your Christmas card list just got a lot shorter.
