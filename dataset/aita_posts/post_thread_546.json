  "post content": "I work at a top European consulting firm that is known for working people hard and serving its clients well. On one project last year, my team members were being required to do a significant amount of work out of their job scope for several months. They were upset and overworked, so I raised the issue to my immediate bosses several times. They replaced me with someone else because they were tired of me complaining about the situation of my team members. \n\nI started wondering if consulting was right for me. I wondered if consulting itself, or maybe just my company, prioritized serving the client at the expense of a certain degree of team fairness/well-being. \n\nSo, after I was removed from the project, I spoke to one of the company leaders, who I had worked with before and had a pretty good relationship with. Here was the exchange I'm wondering if I was the ass hole for:\n\n**Me:** \"I accept my part in what happened and will continue to learn how to best navigate setting boundaries for my team. That said, I think the priorities shown by my immediate superiors prioritized client over our team. That's different from my personal values and priorities. I'm not saying one value/priority is better than the other, but mine is with the team first. In your experience, is that specific to my team, or common in consulting in general and/or this company? I guess I ask because I didn't hear from anyone from the company any acknowledgment of what I was trying to do to protect the team, even if I didn't do it in a way that was liked/effective.\"\n\n**Her:** (getting upset)  \"Ok...I can see why you think that...but you're flat wrong. Don't start judging a whole company everyone based on one thing. People take those accusations very seriously. It sounds like you're saying we don't give a fuck, and I'd be very careful talking like that if I were you.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Ok, thank you. I guess, if I slightly challenge that, I'm not sure what to do when I see something happening like that. I was confused why there weren't more alarms from leadership when the team was in that situation. I'm not sure how to, how would I bring this up in a way that's ok?\n\nShe stayed pretty stern and just told me to stick to facts, revert back to my immediate leadership, and be very careful talking about firm values. I felt really small and like I screwed up her support for me.\n\nPart of me thinks: \"Jeez, she's so great and respected, and I must be way out of line.\" The other part is more cynical.\n\nNot sure how I should have handled it. AITA?",

Her first instinct was to assert dominance instead of actually listening to you and giving you the respect that you deserve. You were very respectful.\n\nI recommend going to HR maybe or just looking for a different job at another firm. This one is not working out it seems. Also, are you the only one complaining? how about the other people who are overworked? are they speaking out too or is it just you?",

When I asked another mentor for advice on how I should have handled the situation.

I lead a team and went through something similar last year when post CoVid production just ramped up into overdrive. There was a lot of head butting because I wasn\u2019t letting other teams push mine around to puck up the slack they should have been. But honestly, sometimes you have to play the game just a little to get what you want. I found that a little charm and reframing goes over much better, with the same results. Instead of \u201cWe\u2019re not doing another teams job, this is on them to manage and fix\u201d I switched it to \u201cOh man, I really wish we could help but we can only do so much in 40 hours. Let\u2019s have a meeting and see if we can postpone the deadline on tasks a, b, and c so we can help you with x, y, and z. I know you guys work so hard and we all appreciate you!\u201d Same fucking thing. One just makes work relationships go smoothly, and gets you what you\u2019re looking for: better time management and respect towards your team and you look like a team player.",

To do that, I need to make sure my team is getting their own monetary kick backs and personal goals met so they stick around and stay motivated to work hard for me. To do that, I have to play the game a little so that when I approach the higher ups for such things I can list off all the ways me and my team benefited them (and how keeping me happy with raises will continue to benefit them). \n\nIt\u2019s a little cold to think of it that way, but honestly my goal is money. When I keep my team happy AND my boss happy, it helps me achieve my own goals. A lot of it is a means to an end, but as long as you\u2019re being a decent person by achieving your goals with your team and not at the expense of them, it should manifest as charm and persuasion instead of slimy manipulation. \n\nI would think about what your own goals are.
