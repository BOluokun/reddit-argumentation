  "post content": "I (22F) have three dogs, all purebred and respectively with extremely sensitive stomachs. Two of them have allergies as well. I take them to a dog park where everyone has unanimously agreed to not give other dogs treats unless the owner is okay with it. Everyone except this one guy (29M) and his kids follow this rule.\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of fights with him and he has agreed to back off. He doesn\u2019t even bring treats, more like cooked leftovers his kids eat and give to the dogs when they are full.\n\nWell a month ago they brought a whole loaf of bread and started feeding the ducks in the pond even though there are signs up not to do that. I only intervened when I saw his kid (7F) handing out to my dogs slices of bread.\n\nI told the girl to stop and that she shouldn\u2019t give strange dogs food. Kid completely ignores me. I called the dogs to where I was sitting and lo and behold the kids came and started feeding the dogs again. I saw some owners scowling, others leaving..\n\n I approached the guy and told him to control his kids. He went \u2018sure Karen, no one should have fun around here when you are around\u2019. \n\nMe: \u2018At least I can get my animals under control. Wanna pay for the vet bills? Get your kids to stop.\u2019\n\nHim: \u2018No one but you minds, go get a social life and maybe you wouldn\u2019t be this insufferable.\u2019\n\nThe next time I came around I brought a giant box of cupcakes and handed them out to the rest of the dog owners and the few kids that they had along. This guy and his kids came around and tried to take some but I closed the box. The guy got confrontational and asked me why everyone could have some but they couldn\u2019t.\n\nI responded.\u2019 Because you need to be taught a lesson about giving and receiving food. Teach you kids to only feed your dog and then I will be more than happy to share my food with you.\u2019\n\nI did it a few more times as I had a birthday, one of my dogs did as well and my niece was born. Each time I left them out of it and refused to let them have any of the sweets.\n\nOne of the other owners approached me and called me an a-hole and vindictive. His logic is that yes, the dad is a complete idiot but I was punishing the kids as well for no reason. AITA?\n\nEdit I have attempted to take the dogs away and keep them by my side. The kids still come and feed them. I have attempted several times to ask the kids to stop but when their dad is telling them it\u2019s okay, they have no reason to listen to me. Short of driving to another dog park an hour away, I cannot separate the dogs and the children.\n\nAlso, cupcakes and human treats are a common thing there. In my country it is believed any happy occasion should be celebrated with sweets for health and prosperity. There is cupcakes or cake almost every week. We contain it to a big picnic table and the dogs have no access to it. Most of them are off running and do not beg. I am not the only one that brings stuff to share.\n\nThis is fine, no one has complained about it as there has been no accidents.\n\n I am quite aware I am running into the risk of someone giving my dogs stuff they are not supposed to have and it has happened. It has, however, always gotten resolved with \u2018hey, please don\u2019t, those three have stomach issues\u2019.",

We babied him too much and didn\u2019t train him right so now we gotta be careful when walking him to avoid encountering other dogs. Anyways, one day my sister and I are walking our dog and some tiny little dog rushes out of an open front door. We tried to rush away from little dog in hopes that we could shake them off our trail but oh god that little critter kept tailing us for at least two or three blocks with no owner intervention. Our dog was losing his mind and it was difficult to control, I was almost ready to just let my dog eat the smaller one and be done with it. \n\nSo yeah\u2026 Please keep a close eye on your dogs, for the safety of all parties.
