  "post content": "I(28m) have a sister (30f) who is marrying in 1 week and a half from now, she and my parents are kinda conservative but nothing too much,exept her fiance(33m) is evangelical and realy religious. We never got along well and had a lot of discussions, he realy disagree with a lot of me and try to change me, like for exemple my bissexuality, political views, lack of religion in my life etc.\n\nWell here's the problem, when my sister anounced her wdding i was happy for her despite my problems with her fiance, but when i received the invitation t\u00f4 the cerimony came a lot of rules like no drinking, no drugs, and men should cut the hair short and have no facial hair, aparently this are evangelical rules her fiance imposed.\n\nWell i have a long hair for a men right now its on my shoulders lenght, and been letting it grow for almost four years now, i immediately contacted my sister and said that I could do the other rules but I wouldn't cut my hair I been styling for four years over one day for religious beliefs are not even mine.\n\nShe started to try to convince me to do it and that men shouldn't even care about their hair that much, she said that as her brother and a important person in the wedding i would be embarrassing them with my hair and that i should leave this rebellious fase behind especially if i wanted a better job(currently a school teacher and loving my job lmao).\n\nWe discussed and fought a lot over the week about it and I ended up saying that if she did not want me as myself I simply wouldn't go, she said she would take my invitation off if I could not do that.\n\nwell 4 days later she texted me saying I was still invited, apparently my parents pressured her to make an exception for me because she would regret not having me there(I never asked for that they did it on their own). But now both sides are calling me an asshole for creating all this drama and my inability for conceding especially my parents who agree with my sister and fiance but think me not going would be worse.\n\nSo aita ?\n\nUpdate:\n  \nSo a lot has happened between my post and now, I want to start thanking everyone for trying to help and giving suggestions, I never expected to get that much attention.\n  \nOn to the update, I have indirectly caused a lot of drama again, my aunt has two sons with longer hair who would not attend beacause of the rules, as soon as she heard of the hole situation with me and my exception, she got realy mad at my sister, calling her hypocrite, manipulated a lot of things, as she says if I can go she should just take off the hair rule and that her sons had the same rights,  now the family started to fight some supporting my aunt and me saying the rules and control are being to much.\n  \nHer family and some family members closer to her cut contact and will not attend anymore, this was a shock to my sister, as she already had lost two bridesmaids and 1 ring bearer beacause the rules for women.\n  \nWell my sister is realy depressed over all this and the hole cerymomy feels like it will be a fiasco. I also won't be able to go as I tested positive for covid yesterday.\n  \nSo that's it for now thanks for all the support",

And I can decorate her wheelchair if it does no permanent damage\n\nThe folks in my wedding party have all agreed to wear the colours I assign them even my bro agreed on a pastel pink suit so long as I pay, he's like I look good in pink but is never wear a pink suit again so you better be paying.... My mum doesn't like dresses so agreed on a nice pantsuit in the assigned colour as long as I'm buying and don't expect her to show cleavage or wear eyeshadow\n\nI do plan on asking my guests to wear white but I'm not going to be big mad if someone wears black or whatever.... That being said I'm going to take my uncle shopping for the wedding because last family wedding he went to he wore a tracksuit.... So I think I'm justified in micromanaging his outfit choice lol",
