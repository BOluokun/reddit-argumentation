I've got a fake grass lawn.\u00a0 A guy walking his dog stopped, let his dog shit in my yard.\u00a0 Baffled, I just say what the fuck?\u00a0 He goes, i'm cleaning it up.\u00a0 I clean it up every time my dog poops here.\u00a0 I tell him I don't care if you clean it up.\u00a0 My young kids play in the grass, like they are now, and i don't want them playing in dog shit.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHe says he always picks up his turds and nothing is left behind.\u00a0 I'm like, there is still poop residue, and your dog peed.\u00a0 Are you spraying my yard down?\u00a0 He of course says no.\u00a0 I say don't ever let your dog do its business here again.\u00a0 He just stares at me.\u00a0 I continue, I don't have a dog, I don't want dog problems affecting my life.\u00a0 He says, you could have just asked nicely asshole and says some other mean things. I yell I hope I never see you again.\u00a0 My wife saw the whole thing and said I was a bit agressive, especially with the kdis around.\u00a0 AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: this blew up.  There is no wildlife where I live.  I don't have squirrels, deer, foxes, whatever else.  I put up spiky things for birds not to shit up my yard. I put cat prevention stuff down to deter cats.   So yes, I don't like it when wild animals shit in my yard either.  ",

They have cheap little fences you can get at garden stores that stake into the ground. There are other options besides taking it all out on this one guy.",

And dogs usually aim to poop on the grass, not cement, and will often walk on the grass when you're on the sidewalk because the sidewalk is too hot or too cold for their paws. And once a dog has swatted, trying to force them elsewhere is only possible if they're small enough you could lift then, and even then they will just continue to poop as uou move them making a bigger mess. Besides not walking a dog ever, I can't really think of a way to prevent this with a 100% success rate.",
