I hate drinking I have never drank my father was an alcoholic I think it\u2019s childish if you can\u2019t have fun without drinking.\n\nThis year I\u2019m hosting Christmas for a change I decided since it\u2019s at my house no alcohol allowed we are all getting older and it\u2019s time to grow up.\n\nMy husbands sister called to ask what she could bring. She saw a recipe for a Christmas martini that she wanted to bring. I told her about my no alcohol rule. She didn\u2019t say much but must have told the rest of the family. Some of them started texting me asking me if I was serious and saying that it is lame. But I\u2019m not budging. \n\nNow it turns out my husbands sister is hosting an alternate gathering that almost everyone is choosing to go to instead. It\u2019s so disrespectful all because they would have to spend one day sober. \n\nMy husband told me he talked to his sister and we are invited to her gathering and he said we should just go and stop causing issues but I won\u2019t it\u2019s so rude. \n\nNow husband is mad because I\u2019m making him stay home and spend Christmas with me but it was my turn to host and I chose to have a no alcohol they could have dealt with it for one year.",

I simply don\u2019t drink and don\u2019t go to places where people get drunk and it\u2019s fine for me.
