  "post content": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nRecently I started browsing the web looking for women who were interested in helping me gain some sexual experience, as I'm still completely inexperienced (kissless virgin...) and feel like some experience might actually help me be more confident when it actually comes to making a first move around girls. I'm in the 18-21 year age range if that's relevant in any way.\n\nAnyways, I got a reply on an advertisement I put out and we started chatting. Turns out this woman is married, has three children and recently had ended an affair with a guy my age she knew personally. She says she's very happy with her husband, just not in the bedroom. \n\nI'm really conflicted and don't know whether I'd be an asshole for helping her have another affair. On the one hand one could argue that she's already ruined her marriage by cheating before or that it's her decision and thus fault entirely or even that I might be helping her keep her marriage and family-situation stable by offering her the one thing she misses in her marriage (complete BS probably), but on the other hand you could say I'd be enabling her to further sabotage her marriage and that I'm an even bigger asshole for doing it with the full knowledge that she has 3 kids that would probably go through a terrible divorce if her husband found out.\n\nIf it's of any relevance: as of now I'm not sure how old she is exactly, if I had to guess based on her pictures I'd say in her late 30s, she wasn't too keen on sharing her age. More importantly, I also don't know what age her children are.\n\nReddit, WIBTA?\n\nEDIT: to all the people suggesting I date somebody my age or somebody who's at the very least single: I wouldn't be on a site like this if that had worked at any point in my life. I tried tinder, it sucked, I have asked girls out before face-to-face resulting in either rejection or just one date with no chemistry, and currently just about every activity in my life happens within a heavily male-dominated group, so I don't know where I'd be supposed to meet somebody in the foreseeable future (I'm busy enough as it is, so I don't want to sign up for new things with the sole purpose of 'meeting new people')\n\nIf I get a response from a serious single woman at any point, I'll probably end this contact in a heartbeat. Also, I'm still studying and currently don't work so an escort is basically too expensive for me. So as of now: judge as if it's this hook-up or nothing at all",
