  "post content": "I am married (18 yrs) to my husband and we have three kids. The older kids have special needs (neurodivergent) and the youngest is a preschooler. I have been a stay-at-home mom until a year and a half ago when I went back to university to get my Masters degree. My husband got his before we had kids. \n\nDuring the workweek, he leaves in the morning right as the kids are getting ready for school. Typically, he gets home after they are in bed. He has every other Friday off, in addition to every weekend. I am a full-time student, and am doing my internship at an agency about 20 hours a week or so. The kids get home by 2pm and I am with them. So all of my stuff needs to be done when they are in school. In addition to almost all the things I did as a SAHM. My husband now does his and the kids laundry and sometimes the dishes or the like. \n\nThis Saturday (like most) I am holed up in my office, working on a very difficult class. The class is online, and the due dates are Saturdays and Sundays. I can't study when the kids are at home, at all. And I can't study when I am doing internship.\n\nSo, with all that backstory, here is my problem: Two weeks ago I went to a matinee movie with my best friend (A Man Called Otto, it's so good!). Today, my husband says that it's not fair because he doesn't have any friends (he's not social) and he wants to go see a movie today. This is the first time he's mentioned it. I said that I need to study. He feels that he's held to a different standard, since he can't go out. I am totally open to him going to a movie, but not this afternoon because I need to work. He feels that he never gets a break, but I did. I said that he has the whole weekend where he doesn't have to work. He said that he has to be with the kids, so it doesn't count. I feel like this is unfair, but I can't articulate why and I am wondering if I am totally wrong. Our kids are pretty challenging, but I feel that they are easier on the weekend, when they aren't stressed out by school.",

While I hate scheduling time, you need to schedule time for each of you away from the kids ahead of time and work so he feels he has time off.  And have your school work built in.",
