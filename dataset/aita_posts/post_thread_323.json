  "post content": "Throwaway\n\nMy (M39) friend (M38)  recently got a service dog, its a diabetic alert dog.  The issue arises in that he wants to bring it to my house when I host hangouts/parties.  I'm not much of a dog person and really don't want it at my house.  It is a breed that sheds and I don't want to have to deal with dog hair in my house.  Also my kids regularly play in our yard and I don't want them to encounter dog poop and pee. \n\nI've spend the last 10 years in this house turning it into a place my friends, family and I could hang out.  I have a pool, I built a bar in my basement, those types of upgrades.  I offered to meet out at a restaurant or someone else's place and host less, but my house is the preferred destination among everyone else.  I have amenities that others don't and there are no expensive food and bar tabs at my place.  I host a lot during football season and other major sporting events, with some general hangouts in between.\n\nI told my friend that his dog wasn't welcome.  I offered to pay for a monitoring device he can use while at my house, but he didn't take that offer well.  He let me know he wasn't happy and recently missed our Super Bowl get together.  AITA?",

A worse thing would be for your friend to collapse and need to go to the hospital. These dogs usually pick it up before it does an test. You could have gotten doggie bags and just asked him to pick up the poop and dog pee in the grass would dry quickly.  Also if he is a Type 1 it is genetic which means your pancreas does not work to excrete insulin know matter how good you are you can still have highs and lows through no fault of your own. Hence the need for the dog. You are right we did go on without service pets for this for a long time and many Type 1\u2019s died early. These dogs have saved so many people alerting others waking their owner. They are highly trained and frankly probably a less messy guest than your human friends.",

The most common way is a test kit where you have to prick your finger to get a drop of blood to test.  These are most accurate. \n\nThe second most common method is a device that you stick on your arm. You wave your phone or a small sensor over it and it gives you a reading. However, this is not as accurate as the first method. My docs prefer the first. But the second method can track your glucose levels over a period of time (because it stays in your arm). I really only use this one. It's close enough for my needs.\n\nSo guest would be sitting there waving this sensor over their arm every 15 minutes or so.  It only takes a second and it's easy.  But would anyone really want to be worrying about their disease all night. If the guest has a dog it sounds like they probably have much more of a problem regulating their glucose, which happens with some people.\n\nWith the dog, guest can relax because the dog will alert them if there is an issue.\n\nEdit: Because people are taking my comments way too literally.  I know  I don't know everything. Apparently there is another kind of monitor that may be implanted or something that I don't know anything about that you don't need to swipe to monitor.  I do not have an insulin pump and I think they may be more common with people who do. \n\nI do think the dog would help the guest be more relaxed.

No endocrinologist who values their medical license would advise a patient to rely on an alert dog for treatment decisions versus the trusted method of blood testing with a meter or using a CGM.\n\nTo be honest, it may not even be a legitimate service dog.   Several studies have shown that \"trained\" diabetes alert dogs can't reliably detect highs or lows and perform worse than meters and CGMs.   One study showed that only a small minority of dogs performed better than random chance at detection, and in another study, the dogs only accurately detected 1/3 of potentially life threatening low blood sugar events.   Their accuracy also plummets overnight because dogs are living creatures who need to sleep, too.    The \"certifications\" are provided only by the companies that sell the dogs.   In many cases they end up being nothing more than extremely expensive ($10-25K) pets and the diabetic person has to rely on a meter or CGM anyways.\n\nIt's entirely up to OP if they want to have a dog in their house - whether a service dog or someone's pet.

Dogs get their fur everywhere when they live somewhere day in and day out for weeks to months. They don\u2019t drop that much in an afternoon (for most breeds). \n\nMy brother has dogs and wouldn\u2019t come to see us nearly as often if the dogs weren\u2019t included. Having dogs in my house isn\u2019t my favorite thing, but they are well trained, and he doesn\u2019t let them be destructive, jump on furniture, etc. I would rather see my brother than deny his dogs. Now, there are also some dogs I would not extend that courtesy to because they are terribly behaved, but that\u2019s usually not the case with a service dog. \n\nSo is it worth it OP?
