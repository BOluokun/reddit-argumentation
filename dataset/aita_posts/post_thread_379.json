  "post content": "So I (43M) don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong here, but my mother is very angry at me, and my best friend said I was a horrible person for saying what I did and I\u2019d be lucky if my girlfriend didn\u2019t put me out with the garbage, since I decided I wanted to act like trash.\n\nMy girlfriend (34F) is a preschool teacher and for some reason I can\u2019t explain she dresses like Ms. Frizzle. Like a dress with the pattern of whatever they are studying. She makes a lot of them herself, now including matching masks. The kids love it, and the parents seem to think it\u2019s great. I don\u2019t like the amount of attention she gets honestly. I\u2019d prefer if she came home and changed before running any errands.\n\nOn Friday, she helped my mom with something after work and she was still in her weird dress. I have told her before I don\u2019t like when she dresses that way, but she tells me I don\u2019t have to like it, but I have no right to tell her how to dress. I was upset she went out like that with my mother, and told her that my mom said she was embarrassed and to ask that she please not dress like that again if they\u2019re going out. I was not expecting her to call my mom and apologize. When my mom asked what she meant, she told her what I said. My mom was furious, explained she doesn\u2019t have a problem with how my girlfriend dresses and thinks it\u2019s great she spends extra time doing things to engage her students. My mom then yelled at me for lying to my girlfriend and trying to throw her under the bus because I was being an insecure jerk.\n\nMy girlfriend and I got into a huge fight. I said she should be embarrassed to be seen in public like that. She said the only thing she was embarrassed by was me. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me or done anything for me since. My friend said I was horrible and called me trash. I shouldn\u2019t have lied, but I think my girlfriend should take what I think about her clothes into consideration and I\u2019m not sorry for expecting her dress more appropriately in public. Am I really such an asshole here?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m sure you all will be pleased to know we broke up tonight. She said I\u2019m to controlling and narrow minded so she broke up with me.  ",

They have other designs with dinosaurs, space, dragons, unicorns etc that would make Miss Frizzle proud. My other favourite is [this](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/148126275232838839/) because it's dogs in flying saucers! Dogs in space, what more do you want?!?! And [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/C1N7HmjK3DHyGNGf6) sausage dog dress brings all the compliments to the yard! I always get atleast one compliment everytime I wear it. Beware though, people will tell you about every sausage dog they've ever met and liked. Oh, the large sausage dogs are pockets! [This](https://joanieclothing.com/barbara-dinosaur-print-button-through-shirt-dress.html) is another awesome dinosaur dress, I can't remember if it has pockets, but according to the website it does, so there you go! They also have a nice section on their website for \"dresses with pockets\" which is awesome. \n\n//forever gutted about lindybop going into administration.",

This sub loves revenge even if its not productive, constructive, or in any way good. Its like \"my boss made a rude comment so I called her a bitch and have to talk to HR, am I the asshole\"\n\nCommenters: NAH! SHE Deserved it! Fucking bitch. How dare she?\nMe: Um, you shouldnt talk to your boss that way, you can literally get fired and ruin your life. If you hate work, try to find a new job but being rude back to your boss is not helpful. \n\nHell there was a post the other day, like yesterday maybe, about a teenager who was rude to her mom and everyone was like \"YEAH FUCK HER\" and i was the one of the few being like, your mom sucks (now i remember, she was racist against asians and asian shows), but you live in her house. You can give a message that racism isnt okay without calling her a racist bitch. Diplomacy here goes a long way sometimes. \n\nBut yeah, most legit assholes wont post here because assholes arent usually self aware enough to know they were being assholes....",
