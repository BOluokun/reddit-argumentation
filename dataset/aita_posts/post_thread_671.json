  "post content": "Throwaway because my brother is definitely on reddit and i think he follows my real account\n\nI am a man in a serious polyamorous relationship with two partners who live with me, I've been in a relationship with one ill call Sarah for 5 years, and another ill call Mia for 3 years. i have two brother but only one is important to this story who ill call Frank. Frank was pretty against me being in this relationship when Mia entered it, he called it weird and exploitative and immoral. he would make little jokes and quips about it to me until one day i got sick of it and sat him down and basically laid down the law about it. told him that Sarah and Mia are the loves of my life and we work so well together and I'm truly happy being with them and if he cant respect that and accept me AND my partners, I wouldn't be speaking to him anymore as his disrespect is actively hurting me and my family.\n\nFrank was resistant at first in the conversation but as we went on he softened up and told me he was just worried about me, but he would do his best to accept me and change his behavior\n\nFrank asks me to babysit my nephew Gumby (who is 4) every once in a while and I'm more than happy to because i love Gumby and so do my partners. Frank dropped off Gumby the other day and we were playing mario party with Sarah while Mia was upstairs doing some work. We finished the game and i had to go do some grocery shopping so i asked gumby if he wanted to come with me and he said \"No i wanna stay here with aunt Sarah!\" i asked Sarah if she was okay watching him on her own and she said \"yeah sure\". i had never left Gumby with just my partners before but i didn't really think anything of it so i popped upstairs, told Mia what's going on and went to get the groceries. came home and we played some more mario party until Frank came to get him. then a few hours later i get an angry phone call from Frank asking me why i abandoned my nephew with my \"fuck buddies\". i was pretty shocked and asked him what he meant, he said that he was asking Gumby what he did at my house over dinner and Gumby told him that i left to go get groceries and left him with Sarah. i said \"yeah. i did that. so what?\" and Frank went off on me about how he left Gumby to be babysat by ME. not anyone else. especially by \"some strange women i hang around with\" and i got really angry at that and started yelling at him, he was yelling at me. until he ended the call with \"you're never seeing Gumby again. you're lucky i dont call the fucking cops on you for leaving my son in a dangerous situation like this\" and he hung up.\n\nso i don't know. i figured i would ask here. should i have been more careful? am i the asshole for this?\n\nTL;DR: i left my nephew with my partners for an hour or so to go get groceries and my brother blew up at me for it because he doesn't accept my relationship as much as i thought he did\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  the rough timeline of Franks jokes/rudeness is that Sarah and i got together. we dated exclusively for about 3 months and she expressed interest in polyamory and i was open to it. so we started bringing other people into the relationship casually. then Sarah reconnected to her old classmate and crush Mia. Mia was casually invited into the relationship and things were so good we kept wanting to see her until we all had a talk and became an official couple and moved in together soon after. i started bringing both Sarah and Mia to family parties and get togethers and that's when Frank started ramping up the hostility and jokes. before that it was just playful jokes here and there that i didn't care about. but this was openly hostile. so after the second family party it happened at was when we had that talk and Frank seemed to genuinely apologize to me, Sarah, and Mia and made an effort to accept me and get to know them at least casually. so we thought he had changed and accepted us or at least began to make an effort to almost three years ago. maybe 2 and a half at the very least.\n\nEDIT 2: alright. the official judgement is that everyone sucks. thank you all for your judgements and advice. i've decided that I'm going to call Frank and apologize for not giving him a heads up that i was running to the store and leaving Gumby with Sarah and Mia. it would have been good to do that regardless of his feelings about my relationship. a quick text giving him a heads up. that's all. But im also going to let him know that what he said on that phone call was deeply hurtful to my partners and i. even if it came from a place of parental panic or anger. he still said what he said and its clear those thoughts and feelings were in him already and he used them to try to hurt me. So im going to ask him not to bring Gumby by for a while to babysit because he clearly doesnt trust or respect my partners and i. and i cant allow that into my home even if i love Gumby so much and want to spend time with him. we can talk about it and try to move past this. but hes lost a great deal of trust, respect and progress in accepting me and my partners and he is going to have to work very hard if he wants a relationship with me again. and if he cant accept that, im going little to no contact.

I can\u2019t imagine this ruling if this were a case where nephew was left with his aunt while uncle ran to the store. OP and Sara have been together 5 years, living together 3, Sara attends family events and knows brother and nephew, and OP has told brother this is the love of his life (as is Mia, to be clear). Being poly complicates options for official marriage, but in practice they\u2019re basically a married couple. If I asked my married brother to babysit my child, and brought my child to the home my brother shared with his wife, I\u2019d consider it pretty implied that wife is welcome to be involved; if someone has to run a quick errand and the child is having a blast with one of them, the other is free to run the errand. I\u2019d pretty much assume that at some point my brother would do dishes, run to the bathroom, and even maybe pop over to the store while his wife took charge. Same would go if I left my child with my sister; sister\u2019s husband would be trusted as well, unless I said otherwise. And honestly, if I didn\u2019t trust the spouse with my kid, I wouldn\u2019t leave my kid at the spouse\u2019s home, even with my sibling there. It\u2019s not like with sibling there, the spouse disappears.\n\nI\u2019d agree with you if this was a casual girlfriend or someone the brother didn\u2019t know, but at this point Sara is basically OP\u2019s wife, an aunt to the child, a part of the family. If brother doesn\u2019t trust her with the child, then that needed to be said.",

Both parties need to communicate, clear up the misunderstanding, and make future decisions accordingly (or OP can just go NC because Frank clearly isn\u2019t changing my his prejudices).",

Seems there are different familial norms or cultures in this, but for me, if I asked my brother to babysit, I\u2019d assume that he and his wife were (welcome to be) doing it together \u2014 and if either of them had to run a quick errand, that\u2019s fine, the child would be with whoever was best for the child in that moment (eg, in this case the child preferred to stay with Sarah and more can go wrong in a grocery store than at home). But I\u2019m used to think of married couples as one unit rather than as two unlinked people, so maybe that\u2019s why? Obviously I respect individuality of each party, but I know everything that happens to one will also affect the other so I don\u2019t generally think I can ask something of one without implied acceptance of the other, unless I specifically say so.",
