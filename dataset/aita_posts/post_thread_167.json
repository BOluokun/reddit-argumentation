  "post content": "The background: I (31M) live in an apartment on my parents property. I pay market rent, before anybody accuses me of being a dead beat. I have one sister, Tressa (19F) from my moms second marriage.\n\nTressa doesn\u2019t always make the best decisions. For example, she got pregnant with my nephew Jerry (3M) when she was still in high school. She has really bad impulse control and she thinks she can do no wrong, which means she doesn\u2019t take advice well. \n\nI\u2019ve always been into body modification, I have about 15 tattoos and gauges. My job pays pretty well (I\u2019m a lineman for a power company), so I can afford it. Tressa has one tattoo, but she wants more.\n\nAnyway, she got her stimulus money recently, and she also has a few thousand from a legal settlement last year. She told me she wants to get an extra ocular implant. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a small piece of metal that\u2019s implanted in your eye, and it comes in decorative shapes, like hearts and stars.\n\nI told her she probably couldn\u2019t find an artist to do it. She only has one tat, and in my experience, artists won\u2019t do extreme body modifications unless you\u2019re really tattooed already. Plus it\u2019s very expensive and comes with some risks.\n\nTressa didn\u2019t like that. She told me she already found a guy, and I\u2019d be watching Jerry while she got it and recovered. I told her hell no.\n\nShe said she just wanted to feel \u201cwild and sexy\u201d like other girls her age, and she felt like she was always being pushed into \u201cthe mom mold.\u201d \n\nI told her she is a mom, in fact, and she should just spend the money on her son. He\u2019s totally obsessed with skating and hockey, and I suggested to use the money for skating lessons. \n\nShe\u2019s been holed up at her boyfriend\u2019s house since, and she isn\u2019t talking to me. I wasn\u2019t trying to say she\u2019s a bad mom, only educating her. Extra ocular implants are a big decision, and they can really impact her future. Right now she\u2019s working BoH at a restaurant, but if she changes fields, it\u2019ll be harder to find a job.\n\nAITA?",

Your response was \"you are a mom spend the money on your kid\".\n\nThis is going to push her to do it, since it's setting up her options as \"wild sexy cool eye woman\" and \"boring mom who can't do anything for herself/be sexy\".\n\nI'd go back and talk to her and tell her it's fine and normal she wants to be wild and sexy sometimes. Moms can be those things. She is still young and you understand. \n\nHowever, you are worried about the eye modification *specifically.* Say it can't be hidden if she wants to change jobs or careers at some later time like many other tats/mods. And say that if something goes wrong she could damage or lose her vision. Also, if true, you can say you don't think they look that cool or sexy. \n\nSay you understand she wants to get herself something to feel young and sexy, and maybe the two of you could discuss some tattoos or body mods or something else that would make her feel like less of a frumpy mom but don't risk her future. For example, even just her joining a fun and sexy/young activity or group, or using the money to buy herself new clothes, whatever. Also, most young woman her age don't have eye mods so it's not like this will help her fit in. \n\nSure, it would be nice to spend the money on her son, but she's clearly not going to do that, so I think you'll have much better luck with this approach then trying to get her to do a complete 180 and telling her her feelings are wrong.",

Also, messing with your eyes especially at that young of an age is a terrible idea. I'm also concerned about what quality of artist says they'd do that when she's so young and doesn't have a lot of other body modifications. Your concerns are valid and you're imparting some wisdom as someone who is older and has multiple body modifications. Unfortunately, some people only learn from their own mistakes, and it's even worse that since she has a kid that means anything she does will affect him as well",
