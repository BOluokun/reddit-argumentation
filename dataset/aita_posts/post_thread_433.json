  "post content": "I (23m) have been with my current company for a year now. Recently, a new guy (Jack) joined our team fresh out of college.\n\nLast Friday my manager invited everyone to a bar after work. There, Jack told everyone about an achievement that he obtained over spring break: he visited his 150th country (Cambodia). In contrast to everyone else, who were asking things such as \u201cWhat was the best/worst/strangest thing you ate,\u201d \u201cWhich countries were your favorite,\u201d and \u201cAny cool stories,\u201d I just said \u201cGood for you\u201d and went back to my drink. Jack noticed me being quiet and asked me why I wasn\u2019t joining in. I said \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me\u201d but Jack kept pressing the issue. \n\nI finally said \u201cJack, visiting 150 countries is cool and all but it doesn\u2019t say anything about you as a person. It just means you had rich parents who could afford to travel internationally several times a year.\u201d (I grew up poor, (literally) worked my ass off in high school, got a full ride merit scholarship, and did everything humanly possible to land my current 6-figure job. Rich people who think they\u2019re better than everyone else just because they had rich parents is a HUGE pet peeve of mine. But my coworkers don't know any of that, since I like to keep work and my personal life as separated as possible.) \n\nJack got really quiet after that and left soon afterwards. Now it\u2019s Monday morning and I\u2019m wondering if I should\u2019ve just kept my mouth shut.",

No, the vast majority of really rich people have inherited their wealth.

Travel *is* a luxury and for a lot of adults, it's something they aspire to do but in limited quantities. \n\n**But**, travelling to a 150 countries is not insignificant and means that your colleague likely went to places that were not luxurious. People who travel like Jack are people who have likely have a curiousity about the world and about other cultures and that's nothing to slight. It does say something about him as a person. \n\nYou also know next to nothing about how he was able to afford to conduct all of this travel. I grew up travelling across Europe, Asia and parts of Latin America and my family was by no means rich, but my mom worked for an airline and that massively alleviated the burden of travel costs. \n\nYour jealousy got the best of you in this situation. You worked hard, no one can or will ever take that away from you, but you do need to come to a place of resolution that people who grew up even moderately wealthy can also work hard too.\n\nEdit to add: I see a lot of people saying that Jack couldn't have travelled to this magnitude of countries while being curious about cultures, and while I agree that it is likely that not every single one of his trips were a cultural experience, people do not travel to that magnitude without some desire to see where other people live and some culture touchstones. And in terms of cost, I think a lot of people are forgetting that other countries in other parts of the world are much more accessible than what you experience if you're departing every single time from America.

After a few minutes of this you start to think \"did I do something to this person?\" because they're so obviously no longer participating in the conversation with the rest of you and are so obviously pissed about something, so you check in. \"Hey, everything okay? You're not going to join in with the rest of us?\" and the only response is \"don't worry about me,\" which is a pretty weird, kind of passive aggressive response. It's not \"Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks for checking!\" It's not \"I just need a minute.\" So you think \"Oh, geez, I *did* do something,\" so you press a bit to find out what you've done, maybe so you can apologize and fix it.

You are biased. \n\n>Rich people who think they\u2019re better than everyone else just because they had rich parents is a HUGE pet peeve of mine.\n\nHe simply said that he got to visit 150 countries. It doesn't mean he thinks he's better than other people. You were all out drinking and he shared this achievement. 150 countries are a lot and it can be a topic of conversation. It's just an excuse to chat about things that are not work related. In these cases, it's normal to mention something peculiar. It happened many times with people I met or during get togethers. People would mention how many languages they speak (if it's a strange number), the number of countries they have been to, or if they ate something new. They would mention if they had spent the holidays somewhere fancy (because maybe it was new to them or they were excited), or if they practice a sport the majority of people don't know. It's not bragging, it's just talking about something that you know would make other people curious and can be a topic of discussion instead of just \"work sucks\", more work talk, or empty pleasantries. \n\nAnd it's not true that it doesn't say anything about him as a person. It says that maybe he comes from money (his parents could work for airlines, in that case you don't need to be that rich); that he is a curious person because if he mentioned this, it means that he thinks it's something worth mentioning. People who take trips for granted usually don't mention them, he probably enjoys these trips. He's young in a new work place, he was probably trying to chat with his co-workers about stuff not related to work, trips are usually a pretty safe topic. \n\nHe was just talking, but you sulked to the point that he noticed and felt the need to ask you why you were being so quiet. This means that you were not just minding your own, but seemed at least annoyed",
