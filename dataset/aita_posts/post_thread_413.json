  "post content": "My lovely girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months. She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.\n\nMy issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).\n\nI asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave.\n\nSince then, she hasn\u2019t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA?\n\nEdit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn\u2019t she have asked??\n\nEdit 2: and no she still hasn\u2019t responded to me\n\nEdit: I\u2019m at work now obsessing but I know that I screwed up. I had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess I\u2019m projecting or something. And no, my girlfriend hasn\u2019t responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money I tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it\u2019s early in my time zone\n\nFinal edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.\n\nAlso, I am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",

So like if she got mugged and they were stolen would he not be more concerned about her welfare than his keys?? \n\nTruly bizarre",
