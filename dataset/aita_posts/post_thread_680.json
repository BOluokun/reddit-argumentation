  "post content": "My girlfriend was over at my dorm and I missed her so much, it's been a while since I saw her. She was in my dorm and my roommate was gone so it was perfect. We were snuggling while watching a movie and I hear knocking on the door. I said \"hey we're busy, please leave if it's not urgent\" and the RA, Michael (that fucker from my previous post) said hes coming in. I told him not to and he said he can, it's his right. I told him to wait a minute (so me a d my gf can put more clothes on, we were in our underwear) and Michael comes in and sees us. \n\nMichael said hes doing a drug and alcohol search. I yelled at Michael as loud as I could \"get the fuck out of my dorm you worthless degenerates cocksucking sack of shit before I forcibly remove you\" he gets scared and d leaves. Fuck you michael. He basically ruined the mood. He then complains later about our \"funny business\" and how he is allowed to intervene. \n\nI got some padlocks and I locked the handle. Now the RA cant turn the knob because the padlock blocks it from doing so. Hes now fucking pissed and so are the other RAs and they're telling me I need to remove it. I told them all to suck my dick and I'm not doing shit, those fuckers wont leave me alone and are violating my privacy. Now I need to go to some bullshit disciplinary hearing about it fucking hell\n\nUpdate: Me and other dorm mates have reported Michael for this shit among other things and we just found out that he is being removed. We just got an email that we will be having a new RA. Fuck yeah,hallelujah\n\nI did however get put on probation for the lock shit and the yelling, though as long as I behave I'll be fine\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, Michael has been creepily flirting with my gf dor a while and this may have been an attempt by him to see my gf. I csnt prove it but it seems very likely especially since he saw her in her underwear",

If there is a problem, he should reported to the hall director and let the hall director solve it. \n\nAlso it\u2019s against the rule to have someone over? For me, as long as ( if you have roommates ) allow it. It\u2019s fine to have people over or even sleepover .  As long as you\u2019re not causing trouble or being a disturbance to others . They just let us be. It\u2019s not RA job to intervene with the student personal life. This is from my own experience but it might be different from you.",
