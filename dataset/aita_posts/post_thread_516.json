  "post content": "That title was intended to make me look like the bad guy here, but let me explain. My(21m) brother(26m) got a new dog. It was rescued by couple who apparently got told by the local authorities that they had rescued too many, and had to give some away. The one he got was a 6mo that seems to have some separation anxiety, and was, and still is, underweight. My brother had to go to another state for some job training, and left Luna (his dog) with me and my parents for a week. While he was here, he told us exactly how to take care of her. Since she is underweight, he has been feeding her slightly more than the recommended amount; 2 cups in the morning and 3 at night(the recommended amount for what she should weigh at 1yo) to be precise. However, he said he was eye-balling her servings, and when we brought out a measuring cup to make sure(since I absolutely SUCK at estimation), we found out that he was underestimating the size of a cup. What he thought was 3 cups turned out to be just 2 cups, so he was giving her something like 1 & 1/3 cups in the morning and 2 cups at night. I decided to just give her 2 cups in the morning and evening, since it was technically more than what she had been getting, but when I texted my brother, he got extremely upset, since the point was for the dog to gain some much needed weight, so she should be getting 5 cups of food a day. I understand that I messed up, but was I actually an a-hole for it, considering the dog was getting more food than she was before?\n\nP.s. I have already agreed to give the dog the 5 cups he asked for.",
