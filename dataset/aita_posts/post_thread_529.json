  "post content": "I just wanted to point out that we are 13 so this might be stupid\n\nMe and my friend had an argument about me being mean. However I think I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m actually the bad one but that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\n\nI did want to say I was a bit mean to him but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong here\n\n1. I treat people based on how they treat me. I have a lot of friends that I\u2019m nice to. He\u2019s probably the only friend I\u2019m a bit mean to. I also give people way too much 2nd chances. There was a person in my class who was basically being mean to me the entire year yet I gave him second chances that he had some reason. It wasn\u2019t until recently I decided he was a horrible human being and I shouldn\u2019t feel sorry for him.\n\n2. He is just mean to people. I treat people about how they treat me. And he is quite a mean person. He has made fun of me for being an atheist and my other friend for not having a dad. He has also seen me mad at him for stuff many times and he just made fun of me. I have also had other people say that they hate him so.\n\n3. He does a lot of annoying things. There was a phase where he wouldn\u2019t stop saying \u201cthat\u2019s gay\u201d and \u201cur mom\u201d. And I\u2019m not offended by ur mom jokes but it is still annoying. Also one thing that I have done to annoy him was lightly touch his bag with my foot, when I don\u2019t see that as much of a problem and he has done worse.\n\n4. I don\u2019t like making fun of people unless it\u2019s him. This might sound weird but listen. When I make fun of someone I feel horrible and even if they don\u2019t care. The only other time I\u2019ve hurt someone I literally cried for a day and it wasn\u2019t visible it was a problem. ( I made fun of someone for being mad at getting 34/35 on a test. Turns out there was other things in there life that made them sad). \n\n5. I don\u2019t think what I did was bad. It\u2019s not one main thing but a lot of little things. I said that he was claustrophobic because he is an arse hole. He said to move more quickly in a hall way and I stopped as a joke and then started moving a bit later. And just small things like that. This is also something he would do and I never made fun of anything serious. But the thing that tipped him over the edge was: U suc.  (We were talking abut a game) and he said why is he unknown man and my friend said (cuz u suc).\n\n(However I did say that he was unusually mad that I was lightly touching his bag with my foot, and that he has done worse.) The thing is though is that I generally believe this. He was unusually mad that I was touching his bag. When I brought this up he said \u201cWell I didn\u2019t do anything\u201d but I don\u2019t think I did anything either.",

Some kids are annoying but his behaviour is pretty much what I\u2019d expect of someone that age. If you don\u2019t enjoy their company, don\u2019t request it and actively avoid it. They may grow up, they may not. I don\u2019t like to call kids assholes unless they\u2019re really sinister - some kids need to lose their friends to realise they\u2019re a jerk and it gives them an opportunity to change their behaviour before they get old enough to just become an asshole. \n\nAlthough for reference, it sounds like my 3 year old would be less annoying to be around :)",
