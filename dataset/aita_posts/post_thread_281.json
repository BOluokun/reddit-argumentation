I work in finance and my wife is a stay at home mom as I earn sufficient for the both of us.\n\nMy wife is a great SAHM and takes great care of our house. I was lucky to buy a home as I earn well in a medium cost of living city.\n\nI love my wife but she finds it humorous to say that I am incapable of doing household tasks, we had agreed that she would do them when we decided she would stay at home but I do stuff occasionally when we are both home if she asks me to, but then if I say load the dishwasher for her she will claim I did it wrong just because I do it different than she does (it still cleans well).\n\nThe other day we were eating and she told me about her day and how she went grocery shopping and optimized the cost by buying specific items at specific stores and accounting for the cost of traveling to each store and she made an offhanded remark that I would never be able to do that and said it in a \"what would you ever do without me?\" kind of way.\n\nI replied back saying that of course I could do it, I handle complex decisions and calculations at my work as I work in finance and that I have a masters degree and what I do involves more intellect than household operations even though I acknowledged and appreciate what she does, I would be capable if the roles were reversed.\n\nShe got angry and seemed to think I was calling her stupid when I wasn't and then cried and now I feel like an AH. She said she was a very good student and had she graduated she would be in my position as well.\n\nMy wife and I met in college but she was an international student studying physics and computer science and she had issues with her loan from her home country and could not afford to complete it and we got married then so she could stay. Initially she wanted to complete it later after finding the funds but she agreed to be a SAHM when I got a good job and I appreciate that a lot as we were able to have a kid early on even while I was both completing my masters and working full time.",

And now for better or worse she is a SAHM with no degree or paying job.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that you are proud of your intellectual capabilities and the complex tasks you tackle at work. It is part of your identity and your ego. Your wife has none of that, even though that\u2019s what she wanted. What little source of pride she has (her household tasks), her own spouse diminishes & minimizes. How would that make you feel if you were in her shoes?\n\nWould you consider supporting your wife to finish her degree?",

The man worked 14-16 hour days during the summer sometimes, in the heat. She fell asleep on the couch watching TV, got up around 2am and went to bed, and he was already cold. They had three kids together, the youngest was 13, so yeah, not LITTLE kids, but still. Kids. She'd had jobs off and on, but had NEVER been the main bread winner and was mostly a SAHM. I will say, I am incredibly proud of how well she stepped the fuck up. The kids did get his SS monthly which helped tremendously, but she has her Medical Assistant certification and went back to work. She obviously didn't want to live in the house he died in, they rented so it wasn't THAT hard to just pick up and move, which they did, and she's been a great single mom to those kids. Granted, she's remarried now, he's been gone 8 years, so definitely fine that she was able to move on, and it was like, 2-3 years after he passed that she met the guy, so in no way disrespectful or anything. But based on her history, we absolutely expected the worst. They didn't have the greatest marriage, I could go on forever giving examples as to why we didn't expect much, but she immediately stepped the fuck up and is still super close with our family and those kids are thriving. Oldest will graduate from a prestigious private university in our state with his Nurse Practitioner degree, going in to sports medicine. Kid was always an exceptional athlete and got a full ride football scholarship. The youngest just turned 21 in January and while she's still trying to figure out her path, she's a great kid who I have no doubt will do well.\n\nBut they got incredibly lucky and things could have been way worse for them.",

      "content": "After reading OPs comments, YTA OP. Your wife gave up everything in order to raise your child. This includes making your masters degree and your career possible, you literally would have neither of those things if she hadn\u2019t sacrificed everything she wanted for herself to make your life possible. She could\u2019ve left you with a kid, returned to her home country and let all of your dreams fall apart instead of her own. \n\nSeveral people have suggested that you take up her job since you believe you can do it, and allow her to return to her education. You have declined. This means you literally *can\u2019t* do her job. You lied. Why would you decline to do this? I\u2019ll tell you, because it has a massive personal cost and sacrifice to give up what you want so someone else can have what they want. That\u2019s what she did for you, you aren\u2019t capable of that, or you would. Forget the groceries. You literally are refusing to do her job because the cost is too high for you to pay (in your mind). It wasn\u2019t too high for her to pay, and for her to keep paying, so you actually cannot do her job. \n\nI suggest that you do something to allow her to be more fulfilled. At a minimum, cut back on your work hours so she can return to her education part time, take up a lot more at home so she can pursue another interest, whatever. Either way, it\u2019s the bare minimum you owe her. She\u2019s obviously unfulfilled and since she made your dreams happen, it\u2019s your turn to return the favor. Stop saying you can do her job when you can\u2019t and are flat out unwilling to, and start looking for ways to give her a sense of pride and accomplishment. She deserves a happy and fulfilled life too.\n\nEdit: For those who are confused, here are OPs relevant comments:\n\nOn the question, \u201cdoes she want to finish her education?\u201d\n\n> She has said that she wants to go back, and talked about the great things she could have done but I never asked her because she always follows up with it might be too late. I did tell her that to an extent it is true that it is hard to start your career late.\n\n> She would not be able to afford it without me, and she would have less time for our daughter if she did that, so I am not super keen on encouraging that and she has not mentioned it to me directly.\n\n> She does not even have a bachelors only an unfinished one. If she went back I feel like she would want to do the same thing or just computer science. She is not into arts or business things. She still does programming as a hobby.\n\n> Initially, the plan was actually for her to start working once she was legally allowed to do so after marriage and then get another loan and go and complete her degree, but once I got a good job we could manage on one income and I asked her about being a SAHM and having a child and she agreed.\n\nOn paying for his wife\u2019s education (please note that his wife made his education possible):\n\n> I was thinking of bringing up getting a second child, I dont think we could afford that if she were in school and I was paying for it, especially an Ivy.\n\n> She was an academic snob back then so she would definitely want to go to an Ivy and she knows our finances so it would be theoretically possible but put a dent in it.\n\n> She would very likely want to finish her Ivy degree, she has 3 semesters left to graduate.\n\n> I was thinking of talking to her about a second kid, she was previously at an Ivy and tuition is expensive (and even more so than when we went) so I dont think she could afford that by working herself. I could only afford it as my parents helped me.\n\nAnd your wife OP. Once again. \n\nOn the fact that a second child would likely set back her goals:\n\n> By then I really doubt she would have any interest in going back for a career and would be too old to get hired for junior roles.\n\n> Now she is not, I meant if we had a second kid and then she went back once the second kid were older.",

You can take a moment like this and say, hey, I think this interaction shows that there is something going on in our lives that needs a tune up! \n\nAnother fun fact: there is nothing wrong whatsoever about going to couples counseling and in fact everyone should do it from time to time to keep your relationship as healthy as possible, like doctor or dental checkups.\n\nOP, your daughter is old enough that she is in school and out of the house and therefore your wife now has time to do more than just be a SAHM. Based on her reaction, she probably needs to be doing more now. She was looking for validation and you were hurt by what she said. You didn\u2019t necessarily say something that makes you the AH but it still hurt her feelings because she appears to feel the loss of not graduating and finding a meaningful job.

It\u2019s time for a shift so everyone can get their needs met. \n\nWhere you kind of become the AH is by not apologizing for unintentionally hurting her feelings. What she needs to hear is that; while you didn\u2019t intend to hurt her feelings, you recognize that you did and you are very sorry for that. Your reaction was defensive and based on feeling a little hurt yourself. This is not meant to be an excuse but to help understand why you responded as you did.

Food may get wasted because the menu for the week didn\u2019t use ingredients efficiently and things go bad- or leftovers get forgotten about in the back of the fridge.",
