This concerns my oldest, I'll refer to her as 'Zara'\n\nWe don't normally do big parties in our family after double digits (and 18th/21st), but Zara has been going through a bit of a difficult time so we decided to throw her a surprise party. This was yesterday.\n\nIt was a big family party and Zara was enjoying it. Then the cake was brought out, I have a lot of young nieces and nephews so naturally they wanted to stand up with Zara, and she had no issue. When she went to blow out the candles, my 5 year old niece blew most of them out before her.\n\nEveryone laughed it off, my youngest actually put 23 candles on the cake and there were still a few lit, so I told Zara to blow those out. She did, but she looked angry and started crying. She then walked off.\n\nAfter that it got quite awkward and my sister (niece's mom) got upset/embarrassed, that her daughter is a kid and didn't mean to do it, and she didn't think Zara would act like this. We all calmed her down that it's not their fault.\n\nI talked to Zara and told her she was being a selfish brat and making a scene, she's 23 getting mad about birthday candles.\n\nShe was still upset, and my other kids are telling me I wasn't being fair with Zara.",

And five is old enough to know if it isn't your birthday/cake, then you don't blow out the candles. The Aunt knew what her daughter would do.\n\nIt must be exhausting to live in a family where even on your birthday, your feelings aren't important, and they aren't really celebrating you...because I'm betting this isn't the first time the eldest was dismissed. (Wanna bet she's always had to set aside her feelings, first for her younger siblings, now for the nieces and nephews.)\n\nYTA.",

She was the brat, feeling entitled to blow off someone else\u2019s birthday candles. Yes, she\u2019s a child but her mother should have immediately to,d her that this was wrong to do and relight those candles. Then the niece could have learned that her behavior was wrong. Now she just learned that she can get away with such behavior and will even get support because she\u2019s a child. Not a great lesson, since she won\u2019t stay a kid forever.\nI would have my daughters back, relight the candles, told my sister and her kid that this wasn\u2019t nice ( I wouldn\u2019t yell or anything but still say it wasn\u2019t right ) and then let my daughter blow the candles, enjoy her birthday and later have a good conversation, to find out what\u2019s going on in her life and what she struggles with and if she needs help.",

A lot of \"issues\" people go through relates to a lack of control or predictability. E.x. accidents/injuries, employment problems, political changes, romantic issues, etc. Things in life we sometimes have some say over but not the final say.\n\nSo having someone userp her birthday celebration and then being told that she is the problem... that completely defeats the supposed purpose of the party and probably just makes her feel worse like she can't even have this one little thing.",

As an adult who often seems to overreact to weird, small things myself, it\u2019s usually because that thing is the final straw representing my larger stress. Case in point: I wanted to have a chill, relaxing weekend. Instead it turned into an exhausting weekend of errands and housework. The weather was nice, so I wanted to take a walk. I knew I still had stuff to do, but I finally convinced myself that a 45 minute walk with my dog would be fine. I had meat for dinner thawing on the counter. I covered it with a plate. I told my partner about it and told him to watch our sneaky cat. When I got back, the plate had been pushed to the floor and a bunch of the meat had been eaten. I snapped at my partner for not watching out for the cat, in a way that I quickly realized was uncalled for. I apologized and explained to him that it wasn\u2019t really about him, that I was upset that a weekend that was supposed to be relaxing has been exhausting and that I already felt guilty about going for a walk, and the meat incident felt like a reminder that I shouldn\u2019t try to do anything relaxing for myself. \n\nIf I had to put myself in Zara\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d guess that\u2019s what happened here. Her best friend\u2019s brother died. It\u2019s likely that she\u2019s been supporting her friend and putting herself and her own needs to the side to care for her friend. She\u2019s probably feeling like she\u2019s putting all of her energy into supporting someone else without getting that same support from others. To her surprise, she gets a birthday party! Some much-needed support and attention on her! But then her little cousin takes the attention away from her moment, and instead of the familiar reprimanding this kid for doing that and supporting Zara\u2019s feelings, Zara is told that her feelings don\u2019t matter and that she should be fine sacrificing her moment because the child is young. It once again makes her feel like her role is just to support other people and not get support herself, and after being given a sense that people are maybe giving her a moment of support via this party, it feels especially like having the rug pulled out from under her.\n\nI highly doubt it\u2019s just about candles, but even if it is, it\u2019s still rude to not reprimand the child for doing that.",
