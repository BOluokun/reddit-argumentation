  "post content": "This happened a few months ago, but has been bothering me since, wondering if I was inadvertently the asshole. \n\nNo throwaway because it's not necessary. \n\nI work in a 911 PSAP, we're a tight-knit group that works together every shift and we get along really well. That being said, there are a couple of girls I don't know really well (aka, their food preferences) and they are not overt about it. \n\nOver the last few times we've had food nights together, I've gathered that they are vegetarians. \n\nA couple of months ago, (not a scheduled food night) I was feeling like Popeye's Fried Chicken. My hubby was going to be passing by a Popeyes and my HQ and I had mentioned that I was craving Popeye's. \n\nMy saint of a husband offered to pick it up for me and drop it off at work. I sent a message around the room informing everyone of my awesome husband and his offer and I made sure he picked up enough chicken for anyone interested... my treat. \n\nI received a message back from one of the girls who is vegetarian saying basically \"Thanks for the offer... but vegetarian.. You know...\". I don't think she was trying to be an a**hole at all. But that made me rethink my decision to offer chicken to the whole room.\n\nShould I have kept my mouth shut unless there were vegetarian options on offer?\n\nAITA?\n\n(On mobile, in case formatting sucks)\n\nEDIT: As someone who has participated in this sub for a while, it's pretty eye-opening, that something that I thought was black and white (I *FULLY* expected to be the asshole) was not even close. \n\nI can honestly say I have a different outlook on differing points of view here now.",

I just remind them that I can't eat pepperoni and we all move on. (I do have some friends who won't order pig meats around me, but they're *close* friends - it doesn't sound like these are particularly good friends of yours.)",
