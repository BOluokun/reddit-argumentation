  "post content": "I (22M) have been dating this girl (22F) for about 3 months. Let's call her Madison. She's smart, cute, nice, and pretty funny.  I'm typing this out because she broke up with me over conversations I had with my best friend. Let's call her Lana.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little after Madison and I started dating, I told Lana all about it. Lana naturally became curious about my relationship, asking what I liked about Madison and whatnot. I said it was too early to tell, but Madison seemed cool and smart. Then Lana asked if there was anything I didn't like about Madison. I told her again that it was too early to tell. I did mention that I thought Madison's boobs were too small, that she isn't all that fit, that she acted too Americanized (she is supposedly half Japanese), and that she doesn't like clubbing. But I did say I'd still give her a chance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday Madison came over to my apartment and we napped together before I had class. She didn't have class yesterday so I expected to see her after I got back. I called her to see where she went. She said while crying, \"Do not ever talk to me again! Why did you even want to date me if you felt that way about me?\" I asked her what she was talking about. She said, \"I don't know, but maybe you and Lana do.\" Then I realized I had left my desktop on, so she was able to see all my imessage conversations. Why she snooped, I don't know. I tried calling and texting her last night again to find out I was blocked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, I tried to talk with her at school before she had class. As soon as I saw her, she was around one of her girl friends who was staring a hole into me. I already knew right then that Madison told her what happened. I saw Madison reassure her friend that she's got this, so her friend stepped away.  Madison had a death stare on her face as she waited for me to come to her.  Our conversation went like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: Why did you snoop through my messages?\n\nMadison: That's really the first thing you have to say to me? Just tell me, is that how you REALLY feel about me?\n\nMe: (I stayed silent, and this is where I know I messed up)\n\nMadison: That's what I thought. (she shoulders me as she walks on by). Excuse me, I gotta go to class.\n\nHer friend catches up to her and yelled \"Suck on your own man tits, b\\*tch!\" as they walked away. Yup, Madison told her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI regret saying those things about Madison to Lana. But I did say some good things about her and I did say I would give her a chance. I think Madison is being really unfair and overreacting. And I think she was out of line for telling her friend about our business. AITA?",
