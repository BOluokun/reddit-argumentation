  "post content": "I share a hallway with my neighbor, and this morning around 3am, I was awoken by a HUGE crash which was obviously someone falling down the stairs.  I went into the hallway to find my neighbor half dressed (her pants were pulled down around her upper thighs exposing her butt) and moaning.  She was obviously drunk, but she has also obviously fallen down a flight of stairs.  \n\nShe didn\u2019t seem injured, but she was disoriented, and at first she was okay with me calling the ambulance, but by the time the EMTs got there a few minutes later, she had started to not want them to come.  She decided to go back upstairs.  I led them to her and got out of the way.  They did assess her and I heard her complaining that I was \u201cin her business.\u201d  They convinced her to go to the hospital I guess just to be checked out since she had been drinking.\n\nNow this was a fall on my landlords property, so I thought he should be aware.  I sent him a text telling him that she had fallen and that I called the EMTs and they took her for assessment.  I also mentioned that she wasn\u2019t happy with me calling, but I didn\u2019t mention that she was drunk or half naked\u2026 only that she had been disoriented. I was thinking of liability and that he should be aware.\n\nWhen she came home, I am pretty sure I heard her complaining that I \u201ccalled everyone.\u201d\n\nSo\u2026 AITA?\n\nEDIT:  let\u2019s start by saying I am TA for contacting the landlord. That\u2019s the general consensus, although it\u2019s not unanimous. I accept that judgment.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t accept the motives people are ascribing to it.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve had time to process the whole thing, I feel like I need to respond in general to the idea that I said anything with a motive of either getting her in trouble or spreading gossip.\n\nIf I had wanted to get her in trouble, she\u2019s done other things that I could\u2019ve complained about reasonably. I haven\u2019t because that\u2019s not actually my goal. I have no desire to get her in trouble. The sense that she does that annoy me or in frequent enough that I can let them go.  Some of them are just annoyances like noise complaints, and one is more serious that I don\u2019t feel comfortable putting on here. It hasn\u2019t affected me directly, but other neighbors have also complained about the same thing to me.  That problem involves a boyfriend that she appears to no longer be with, so it\u2019s not really an issue.\n\nI know the stairs are a little bit shady. I think they\u2019re in code, I don\u2019t feel comfortable climbing on myself, my previous neighbor fell down them once but not as seriously. I think the main problem that I see with them is that you have to stand on the top step and lean back to unlock the door. So is it possible that the fall was caused by the configuration of the stairs? Yes.\n\nFalling down the stairs is not an annoyance. It\u2019s an emergency.  So let me explain a little bit where my mind was last night.  \n\nI was very sound asleep when I was woken up. It was a loud stumbling crash followed by very weak moaning.  I was scared. It took me probably two minutes to get up the nerve to open the door because I don\u2019t have a peek hole and I had no idea who or what I would find, but I did that someone was probably hurt.  there was no light shining under the door so The hurt person had to be leaning against the door.  I remember being afraid that whoever it was would fall in to my home, and since I didn\u2019t know who it was or what was happening, that concept scared me.\n\nI also recognize that the likelihood was high that it was my neighbor, and that she was probably hurt.\n\nI open the door and found what you know: a crumpled up half naked unconscious (I\u2019m not sure if I should be saying semi conscious because she was moaning) girl.\n\nI was not thinking \u201cOh cool! What a great story.\u201c What I was thinking was \u201coh shit. What do I do?\u201c\n\nI was scared and trying to do the right thing. So yes\u2026 I am TA for making a bad decision to contact the landlord, but I did not make that decision because I wanted to hurt anyone. And it really bothered me that so many people said that\u2019s why I did it. So if I appeared to be arguing against that judgment, that\u2019s why.  I wasn\u2019t arguing against the judgment itself, but rather the motives people have ascribed to my decision.\n\nI accept my judgement, though.",
