  "post content": "My (22F) gf's mom came over with two of my gf's nieces (6 and 3F). We were welcoming and nice and let the two girls nap in my room when they got tired. \n\nThey had found my childhood stuffie, which is  a husky I had named Emma and took her everywhere for 15 years. Emma is also wearing my favorite shirt from when I was two, because I wanted to keep it close. They took a huge liking to her and asked if they could take Emma back home with them, because I clearly didn't need it. \n\nI told them no, and explained how much I loved her and how much she meant to me. I told them that I had a great aunt who I loved, but she'd passed away long ago and she had gotten me Emma when I was a baby, so I didn't want to let go. I (slightly embarrassedly) told them I actually still slept while cuddling her. I told them the story of the shirt, but they wouldn't budge. \n\nThey began screaming because I wasn't letting them have the husky. My gf's mom heard what was going on and immediately sided with the girls, because 'I am too old for a stuffed toy' and 'shouldn't really care'. She called me an a-hole and told me that I'm pathetic for 'loving to make innocent children cry' and that 'I just love the feeling of power I have over them', before leaving, with the promise of coming back to get the husky when I couldn't do anything about it. \n\nMy gf and her dad are siding with me, but my gf's siblings, mom and aunts are all with the two girls. So, AITA? \n\nUpdate: I have reached out through my gf and offered to buy the girls similar ones from Amazon or IKEA, but I've been told it's got to be Emma because the girls want the shirt too\n\nUpdate 2: this got deleted earlier but Emma has been taken to safety, a ring camera and mini security cameras have been ordered, and my gf's family except her dad have secured a nice telling off/talking to (read: yelling at for upsetting me)\n\nUpdate 3: I didn't think I'd be back so soon but here I am. The 6 year old's elder sister (13F) has just shown up at our doorstep saying she was kicked out by her grandma because she heard what happened and agreed with me supporting 'people who love making children miserable'.",
