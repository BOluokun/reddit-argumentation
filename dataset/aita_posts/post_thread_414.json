  "post content": "Okay just writing the title like that made me feel super guilty, but please hear me out before judging too harshly.\n\nI (38 F) have 4 kids ages 11 months, 3, 5, and 10. I love them all more than anything, but I\u2019ll be the first to admit that our house is constant chaos and it can get very exhausting. My sister (33F) is child free, but loves my kids and was happy to watch the older 2 or sometimes 3 to help me keep my sanity. This has been extremely helpful and I tell her all the time how grateful we are for her help.\n\nThe thing is that the kids used to go over to her house, but right now they couldn\u2019t because my sister was fostering an elderly chihuahua. My sister claims she couldn\u2019t have them over for the time being because they would stress out the dog. Her dog was extremely frail and timid so I think this was a fair assessment. This was the 4th dog she has fostered, all of which couldn\u2019t be around my kids. This most recent dog took 8 months to find a home for, but most of her other dogs took even longer. When she told me she found an adopter I knew I could finally breathe a sigh of relief and joked about how I was so glad she could babysit again.\n\nMy sister proceeded to tell me that there was a second dog that desperately needed a new foster, so she planned to take in that one as soon as her current dog was gone. So, she couldn\u2019t do anymore babysitting than she already is (sometimes she comes over to my house in the morning to help out). I could literally feel my stress levels spike. I haven\u2019t ever done this before, but I opened up to her about how much I have been struggling since she got the dog. How little sleep I get each night, how my husband hasn\u2019t been helping as much as he should, and some other deeply personal issues that I\u2019ve been struggling with. Then I asked her, point blank, to not get another dog.\n\nShe comforted me, but ultimately didn\u2019t agree on anything and said she needed some time to think. I know I am asking a lot of her since rescuing dogs is her passion and that is why I feel so guilty. But I don\u2019t have anyone else to help me. I can\u2019t afford a babysitter long term, and my friends all have their own kids to look after. Above all, my kids will always come before a dog and that\u2019s the reason I was willing to request it. I\u2019ve told a few different people about the situation and gotten a wide range of heavily biased opinions. So that\u2019s why I decided to come on here and as you guys. Was this unreasonable? I would never demand her to do this if she didn\u2019t want to, but is it really so wrong to just be honest my situation and earnestly ask?\n\nEdit: I am grateful for the honesty from people respectfully telling me that what I did was wrong. However I have also read a lot of horrible assumptions from people as well and I\u2019d like to clear them up. I am not some careless mother who just keeps \u201cpopping out children\u201d that I can\u2019t take care of. My husband is not a deadbeat dad. After our youngest was born he got severe depression. He isn\u2019t out having fun while I\u2019m working 24/7, he is miserable. I went to my sister instead of him for help because I don\u2019t want to lose him. I love my kids and I have always made every one of my decisions with what I believe are their best interests in mind. And no I don\u2019t think my sister is obligated to do anything for me, I was asking for help not demanding it.\n\nEdit 2: Insulting my husband doesn\u2019t help anyone. Yes he is in therapy and is on antidepressants. Anyone who has actually dealt with depression would know that that isn\u2019t an instant cure all. Still my husband does the very best he can. I asked my sister because I needed more help than he can provide right now.",

      "content": "YTA.\n\nAbsolutely no one loves to admit this to themselves, but your own life choices led you to this point. Your exhaustion, your sleepless nights, that fact you're broke, your inability to find a consistent babysitter... these are all problems you've invented for yourself by having children outside your means.\n\n*Your sister's time isn't any less valuable just because she's child-free.* Child-free people don't exist on this earth to watch your children. It's wonderful that she's offered to watch them as much as she has, and it's great that you remember to thank her often, but you have to understand that when she *does* watch your children, it's not because her time is worth less than yours and it's just naturally expected that she help you. **Her time is not something you're entitled to, and her help is not something that's owed to you just because you're a parent and she's not.**\n\nTry to take the incoming flood of criticism as a wake-up call. If your husband isn't pulling his weight, it's time to consider counseling. Cast your net out over the area and see if you can pin down an affordable babysitting network. Field your options and stop leaning on your sister to solve your problems.\n\n\\---\n\nedit -- I sleepily clicked on reddit this morning and was flabbergasted to see that this comment blew up in this way. I can't thank you all enough for the rewards, for sharing your experiences and stories with me, for the civil debates happening down below, and for your kind words. I don't know what to say. Thank you.\n\nFor the record, I promise I don't lack sympathy for OP's situation -- just patience. The fact that husbands like this exist drive me absolutely up the wall. -- edit -- OP says husband has clinical depression and is doing the best he can, so I'll back off this point. If OP lives in a state where a support network isn't readily available (birth control, work comp, parental leave, affordable daycare services) and she didn't have much of a personal say in how much children she had because the husband pressed the issue, I sympathize with her cornered feelings and again urge her to reach out for options. But any implication whatsoever that the sister *should* be available because she's child-free is an absolute no-go and OP needs to get that out of her head immediately.\n\n\\--\n\nedit #2 - I waffled on whether or not to add this, but after reading some more responses, I think I do want to very gently cap this off to help clear up one more thing.\n\nThe problem here wasn't the act of asking itself. It's examining why, in any society, this is something that's generally acceptable to ask from a child-free person at all. This wasn't a matter of asking for an increase in daycare services -- it's asking someone to completely restructure their way of life to accommodate your own, because deep down, there's still an implicit assumption that your agenda as a child-bearing person is more valid than the agenda of a child-free person.\n\nThe reason this hits so close to home for so many people is that even in 2022, the societal recognition of value for child-bearing people over child-free people continues to demean and damage those who choose to go without. It's a *constant battle* to find self-worth when it's implied, even quietly -- even accidentally -- that your needs and passions are lesser. That as a non-parent you're somehow inadequate or have something to prove. This is especially true as a woman. The older you get, the harsher the judgment you receive.\n\nAgain, these were awesome discussions. I was privileged to read through them today. Thanks again.",

Unfortunately, as the years went by, it just wasn\u2019t coming together, things kept happening that didn\u2019t allow me to be reasonably confident that I would be able to offer a child what a child needs. I was not going to give birth to a child who was not going to be safe enough and have enough of their mother\u2019s care and attention. This was me being responsible: I was not going to have kids I would have to rely on other people to help raise. I had too much on my plate, but that was not other people\u2019s fault or problem.\n\nMeanwhile, I enjoyed my relationship with my nieces, and of course given that I had no children, I had time and resources to contribute to help my sister out, taking the kids for a few days so she can focus on her own needs and get things done more efficiently, and doing activities with her kids that she couldn\u2019t do, taking them to the theatre and teaching them to cook so they can learn something new they can be proud of. I was always perfectly aware of how this was valuable to my sister, but never saw it as something that entitled me to anything in exchange, because having those moments with her kids was enough of a reward for me, since I didn\u2019t have any of my own. I bought the kids expensive, thoughtful gifts, the kind you want to keep for life as an heirloom.\n\nAs I started to approach the age where one is too old to be a mother, I heard, through other family members, that my sister said \u201cgood thing she\u2019s not gonna have kids, so she keeps spending her money on mine.\u201d That\u2019s when I stopped buying gifts and replaced them with inexpensive tickets to go see theatre plays. The kids wouldn\u2019t care about the cost of the tickets, and they would still enjoy the events. That\u2019s also when my sister stopped inviting me to birthday parties and Christmas gatherings, lying to me saying there is no party this year, only to find out through family members that there was a party, who accidentally revealed it because it slipped their mind that they were expected to lie. I have as a result no relationship with my nieces anymore.\n\nI hate people who birth kids for other people to raise, with a passion.",
