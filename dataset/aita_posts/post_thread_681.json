  "post content": "So I was recently talking to a girl over text after she saw my photo with my cousin on instagram, and she knows my cousin. My cousin then gave her my number, and this is where it all took place.\n\nSo we started chatting, when she abruptly asked me how tall I am out of no where. I answered and she sent a sighing emoji telling me that short guys suck (in a nutshell). I figured since she wanted to distinguish a barrier between her type and not her type, I decided that I might share mine.\n\nI asked her how much she weighed, which she then left me on read for nearly an hour. The reason why I asked her how much she weighs is because I pride myself in the hard work I put in to my workout to stay feeling well and to possibly increase my chance at finding the type of women I like. \n\nAnyways... She responds telling me that I\u2019m a dickhead and that she is gonna try to spread this news to everyone at my school to lower my chances with other girls. I did not realize that the question would offend her, and my intentions were good, just trying to make sure that I was gonna talk to a girl that I  would be glad to meet once this whole thing is over. \n\nAnyways, although I may have accidentally hit a sensitive topic without realizing the repercussions, I promise I had good intentions and was not trying to make her upset, so Reddit, Am I the A-Hole?",
