  "post content": "When I (24F) was younger, I received a scholarship to attend a private high school. I had a hard time fitting in at first because everything about me gave away the fact that I didn't come from a well-off family. It wasn't uncommon for me to just cry in bed after I came home from school. One day, when I was eating lunch by myself for what seemed like the 500th time, Jenny (25F) sat next to me and asked me how I was doing. I was initially suspicious that someone dared her to talk to me, but she then ate lunch with me for the rest of that week. I\u2019m forever grateful for what she did and we\u2019ve been friends since.\n\nJenny's life seemed ideal to me at first. She lived in a beautiful house, wore designer clothes, and always had the latest iPhone. As we grew closer, she confided in me that her life absolutely sucked. She said that her parents (both surgeons) seemed to care more about their patients than about her. They never showed up to any of her choir concerts or track meets and had to be dragged to graduation. She wished that her family was like mine, as my family actually ate dinner together at the table.\n\nThat said, some of Jenny's problems really did scream \"rich people.\" For her 17th birthday, her parents promised her a spring break road trip to the Grand Canyon. She was so excited during the month leading up to spring break and I was so excited for her. On the Friday before spring break, Jenny tells me that her parents changed their minds and instead \u201cdid what they\u2019ve always fucking done\" for her birthdays and Christmas (hand her their credit card, tell her to buy whatever she wanted, and then barely acknowledge her existence). I'm going to be completely honest, there were many occasions when I wished that my most pressing problem was being forced to go on a shopping spree. However, I kept my mouth shut because Jenny's home life truly was terrible thanks to her completely absent parents.\n\nMoving ahead to today, Jenny is making around $200k in the tech industry. I'm not making anywhere near that kind of money but I'm doing OK for myself. We aren't as close as we used to be ever since she moved to California, but we still text each other several times per week.\n\nMy rat Emile died on Saturday and last night I learned that my grandma's cancer came back with a vengeance. I'm obviously not in the best mental state at the moment. I texted Jenny about this, and after a \"D: holy fking shit that really sucks,\" she complained that the new coffee brand in the break room is shit compared to the old one and to make it worse, no one in the office knows what the old brand was so she can't go buy it herself. She then complained that the cafeteria in her building stopped serving a particular gelato flavor so she's had to go to another building if she wants it. I said \"Jenny, I love you, but I really don't have the mental capacity to listen to you complain about rich people shit right now.\" She called me a jerk and said that friends always listen to each others' problems.",

Hers were absent, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me that she\u2019s awkward when it comes to comforting a friend - she probably never learned how. Did she handle this situation well? No. But it sounds like she was trying to distract you or even be funny and just fell flat. She probably has no idea how to be there for you because no one modeled it by being there for her.\n\nI have to say, you sound very dismissive of the emotional neglect she suffered at her parents\u2019 hands - and that\u2019s common with those of us who had present parents and don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s like to live without the support system you take for granted. Life experience will open your eyes to it, though, and you\u2019ll soon see you were the richer one all along.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear about your Grama and pet. Wishing you well as you navigate this tough time.\n\nESH",

It didn't work and OP went for the throat, kinda showing what she really thinks of her friend. Even tho said friend's emotionally neglectful but rich parents are exactly the reason why she didn't know what else to say or do.",

I have found that people enduring a trauma don\u2019t know how to deal with it themselves any more than their close ones know how to deal with supporting them. \n\nWhat she was talking about is not \u201crich people shit\u201d and saying \u201cI love you BUT\u201d makes it clear, your love is conditional. It really sounds like she didn\u2019t know how to help you with your grief and was trying to distract you a bit with mundane stuff. You would have done better to tell her what you need rather than snap some vague clich\u00e9 about what you don\u2019t. She can\u2019t read your mind and if she has never had a loved one get very sick or die, she probably has no clue how to help you. In your upset, you may not have known yourself. \n\nWhat did you want right then? Perhaps something along the lines of \u201cI love you AND I appreciate you trying to distract me or make me feel more normal, but what would really help right now is if you could listen to me talk about my pet/grandma for a bit.\u201d",
