  "post content": "Last night my bf & I were really tired after long days. He wanted to get cheeseburgers, so we did, and I said I wasn\u2019t very hungry but wanted some fries & could we get a large to share? He said that would be fine. \n\nI ended up recognizing that I was hungrier than I thought & got a cheeseburger for myself. I asked him if he still wanted to do the large fry to share and he said yes. \n\nOn the way home, he was going to town on them, about 2 miles away from the restaurant and less than a mile away from my house, I reached into the bag to eat a fry and there were barely any left. Maybe 10 fries in the container. Including what was in the bottom of the bag (which was unknown to both of us at the time) there were about 1/4 of the fries left.\n\nI instantly became upset, and said something like \u201cyou ate all the fries, wtf\u201d & I feel angry, and kind of withdraw into myself a bit, trying to calm down but obviously very angry. He says \u201csorry, I\u2019m really bad about waiting to eat\u201d. I say, \u201cthat\u2019s so rude. You knew I wanted some.\u201c He says \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know you wanted that many\u201d. He grows silent & we get home & I\u2019m not letting it go. I am want a real apology & acknowledgement for my feelings out of the deal (which is starting to feel like pulling teeth). I\u2019m getting excuses, mixed in with maybe 1 or 2 \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2019s\u201d. We end up settling on \u201cI thought a quarter of the fries would be enough since you said you didn\u2019t want many\u201d, but that didn\u2019t feel honest since there was less than a quarter left in the container & we didn\u2019t even know there were any in the bag.\n\nAITA for being upset at my bf for eating almost all the fries and not accepting his defense immediately instead of a complete apology?\n\nEdit: Therapy can\u2019t compare to hundreds of people on the internet telling you \u201cyou suck\u201d. I want to say thanks to everyone who has shared their opinion. I truly am here to gain perspective and make changes for myself to improve my relationship, and those things seem clearer to me now. This post is bigger than I expected, and I want to keep going through comments for any new information that might help me or questions that pop out, but I think I\u2019ve gotten most of what I needed & am grateful. I think I owe my boyfriend a heartfelt apology for how I handled things.",

              "content": "Well, although I agree that they should\u2019ve ordered separate fries and making the post itself was a bit dumb, it\u2019s pretty common courtesy that if you\u2019re sharing something, it\u2019s halfsies, unless otherwise determined before hand. He was definitely an AH for eating more than half. The \u201cI\u2019m not very hungry\u201d applies to the \u201cI don\u2019t want that much to eat so I won\u2019t order a burger, but I\u2019d like to split fries\u201d. Also, it seems as though she communicated she was hungrier than previously established because she ordered a burger, then asked \u201cdid you still want to share fries\u201d, which tells me chances are she causally mentioned \u201coh, maybe I am hungrier than I thought. I\u2019ll get a burger too\u201d.\n\nSo, while yes both points are true, it\u2019s literally just common courtesy to eat half if you\u2019re sharing. If you\u2019re unsure of how much someone wants, you eat half and wait for them to finish. If they eat them all, great. I\u2019d they don\u2019t, more for you.\n\nPlus, who eats nearly an entire large fry (I\u2019m assuming McDonald\u2019s or another FF chain) on the way home? I live 15 miles from any decent FF chain and I still wait until I get home regardless of how hungry. Just a general cleanliness thing *and* they\u2019re sharing, kinda hard to dictate how much you should eat when one of you is driving.\n\nMy dad was much like OPs boyfriend. I doubt it\u2019s a one time thing. It was annoying then, it\u2019s annoying now. They set rules, he couldn\u2019t follow them.

No problem there. Upon getting to said FF chain, she realized she was more hungry than previously established. Right, fair. So, she told him (I\u2019m assuming) that, so she ordered a burger. Now, even if she didn\u2019t tell him, how could he not have noticed? Anyone in my family or my GF would\u2019ve noticed, and would\u2019ve said \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t hungry\u201d. If that wasn\u2019t enough to sway the \u201cbut did OP actually communicate\u201d, she further asks if he would still like to share. So, at this point, they had to have had a conversation about OP changing her mind.\n\nThis, to me, is what made him an AH. My GF has said \u201cI\u2019m not super hungry, can I just have a few fries(a handful for her)\u201d but later is actually very hungry and eats more than intended. She still leaves me half and fixes something else for herself. She\u2019ll still ask and say \u201chey, I\u2019m sorry, I was hungrier than I thought. Can I just have 1/4 or half?\u201d. She knew we agreed on a predetermined amount (normally if we just say \u201cshare\u201d it\u2019s half and half) and wanted more than her handful, so she did the courteous and respectful thing and asked. \n\nThat\u2019s really my only gripe. The fact that, after telling him (it would be the same argument if the roles were reversed, too) she was hungrier than originally thought, and asked again if he was sure he wanted to share, he still ate most of them. To me, it would just annoy the absolute hell out of me. Yet, people blame Op for not communicating. To me, she communicated plenty, he just didn\u2019t care or wasn\u2019t paying attention.",
