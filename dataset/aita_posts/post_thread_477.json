It is an expensive concert, but I really wanted to go there at that time. My husband didn't want to go, and after thinking about it I didn't want to go without him, so we decided not to buy tickets... \n\nFast forward to today, the new date for the concert is next Saturday, and one friend who originally wanted to go can't go anymore. My husband was offered the ticket, and now he wants to go to the concert. \n\nI don't want him to go, as it is one day before we go to our family vacation and we have a lot of things to prepare (we have to kids 3 years and 9 month old, so I can't do any of the packing alone) and also because originally I was the one who wanted to go. \n\nBut I feel like I might be the A-Hole here if I tell him that I don't want him to go...",

Did you explain to him in the first place, in 2020, that it was really important to you for him to go with you, and he still refused? Or did you just quietly decide not to buy tickets if he didn't want to go?\n\nHe could pack for the trip ahead of time, so that's clearly not the issue.\n\nOP, NAH.
