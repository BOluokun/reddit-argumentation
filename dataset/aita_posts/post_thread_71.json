  "post content": "Alright Reddit. Here to get my judgement. So I (26M) have been dating my GF Chloe (26F) for 3 years. We started out as friends and have known each other since HS. She really is perfect for me in every way. Other than her family which is the cause for this post. \n\nSo when we first started dating I was wanting to get married. But about a year ago I switched that up. The reason sounds stupid but it just caused me to freak out. We were watching this show that talked about divorced men and their struggles. It turned me onto a couple sub Reddit\u2019s on here about men who got boned in divorces. Weather that be cheating spouses, alimony or the freedoms men loose when they get married. I sometimes wish I never went down that rabbit hole. But I did and ever since I\u2019ve been very clear with Chloe I don\u2019t want to get married. \n\nI\u2019m fine being life partners. Having kids. All that. I told her this and she was very sad. We did split up for a bit. But she came back and said she didn\u2019t mind. She is fine with whatever life we build. So that is what we\u2019ve been doing. The issue?? Her family is nosy as shit. After getting questioned countless times about it we finally sat them down and explained we don\u2019t plan on getting married. Her family lost it. Saying that I was the one forcing this and bunch of other BS. Her sister especially is pissed. \n\nWe are at a BBQ this weekend. And sure enough her sister is mouthing off. She is recently engaged and was throwing shade about \u201chow amazing it is to be committed\u201d. I caught some side glances from her parents. I looked at her and said \u201cif you have something to say go ahead\u201d. She said \u201cyou just wouldn\u2019t understand the feeling\u201d. I said \u201cwell considering you\u2019ve been engaged 3 times and married once already. I\u2019m not quiet sure you know the right feeling either sweetie\u201d. Her dad and mom then butted in saying I needed to take that back. I said \u201cboth of y\u2019all have been divorced before. So maybe stop the petty glances and look in a mirror\u201d.\n\nI was done after that. And me and Chloe left. I know it\u2019s not smart getting into with your GFs family. But I feel like they are crossing a boundary and I felt like it had to be said. Chloe is staying out of it mostly. But I want to make sure I\u2019m not the AH. AITA?",

Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house or some shit....\n\nBut as a male whose divorce literally bankrupted him you're dumb AF for letting a TV show and some Reddit threads be the reason you're not going to get married.

You were also super condescending.\n\nMeanwhile you yourself know that your refusal to get married is almost completely due to not trusting women specifically. You weren't converted by stories about people getting screwed over by shitty partners. You're paranoid about men getting screwed over by their wives. You're also imposing that paranoia on your girlfriend (which is also a referendum on what you think about her character, btw. She's being very generous to get back together with you.)\n\nMarriage offers innumerable benefits and protections to both spouses. Your \"life partner\" is *not* your next of kin; as far as the law is concerned, without any kids, you two are (at most) roommates. If you died without a will, she wouldn't even be entitled to keep a pair of your socks. If you wound up incapacitated, your parents could ban your girlfriend from seeing you. There's also all sort of tax and financial benefits. Spouses have all sorts of privileges.\n\nI think that you should sit down with a lawyer to talk about how prenups work in your state. It's *highly* probable that most of your concerns could be addressed via the legal system. There's a very good chance that you're unnecessarily disadvantaging yourself due to an irrational fear.",
