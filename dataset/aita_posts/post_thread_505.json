  "post content": "Not really sure where to begin, so if this feels disorganized or rambly, my apologies. My bro and I (we twins) live with our Uncle and Aunt and their two toddler children. Back in 2019 my bro and I got ourselves fired stupidly from our job (totally our fault) and had some financial issues. We used as much of our savings to pay bills and tried looking for some good job opportunities. But when some jobs feel through and our savings dried up, we couldn't pay our bills. My uncle stepped up and helped us by paying for our bills. This came with the stipulation that we would pay him back when we could, which when we got jobs again, we started to do. However, when we paid more than half of it back, about 5kish, covid hit and we all got furloughed, my bro, uncle aunt and I. My uncle and aunt ended up getting called back to work but now needed babysitters again for their toddlers. Since with covid they didn't trust babysitters outside our bubble, smart, my bro and I stepped up and started babysitting. At first, we were more than happy to help out family and never expected any pay despite having to babysit 30ush hours a week. We thought we would babysit for a month or two and that's it, no big deal. I would also like to add that we stopped paying back what we owed shortly after getting furloughed since my bro and I are simply on unemployment now. However, it's now been nearly a year and we have been babysitting 30ish hrs a week nearly that whole time. I won't lie, it's been tough. Props to all the parents here on reddit but without shit like Masha and Bear or CocoMelon (it's like crack to kids), idk how we woulda done it, I'm not built for kids that's for sure haha. Don't get me wrong,  I'm still happy to help and my cousins are adorable and I've learned a lot about kids which is good. However, we've been babysitting this whole time no pay which I would still be okay with if it wasn't for my Uncle constantly reminding my bro and I of the money we owe him. I get it, we did say we would pay it back, I just think it's a little unfair how helping my bro and I comes with an IOU, while babysitting for them comes with nothing and it's saving them 1200 or more a month on babysitters, they told me how much a while ago. \n\nSo dear reddit, tell me, would I be the ass hole for asking for the rest of the debt to be wiped clean, should I ask for pay continuing on, or what? Generally lost on this and have felt guilty about bringing the situation up with my Uncle when I was so irresponsible in 2019. So let me know what you guys think. \n\nSome info: we babysit 3 days a week and each of those days are about 8 hrs to 11 hrs of babysitting depending on my Uncle and Aunt's schedule. In all this time, we only missed one day of babysitting (got snowed in at a friend's house) resulting in Aunt having to call out. Other than that, we have been ready and available whenever their schedule calls for it.\n\nEdit: to be clear, my bro and I pay all our bills and always have except for the period of time where our debt with Uncle accrued. Right now all bills are paid fairly and evenly since end of 2019.",

You failed to even discuss it before so it was taken as goodwill or maybe paying interest on the debt you owed.  That's not a good deal for you, but it's your fault for not bringing it up sooner.\n\nIf you ask them to start counting any future babysitting towards paying down your debt and they don't agree, then let them know you'll stop babysitting in a couple weeks.  That way they'll have time to get a new babysitter or simply change their minds.",

Between the free child care--which is saving you by your own words over $1200 a month--and our debt to you.  It almost seems like some if not all of the balance of our debt should be settled by our help over these last 12 months... We love you guys and don't want money to become an issue, so we wanted to talk it out -- what do you think?\"  If they don't see where they should step up and forgive the balance or at least part of it...then go from there if you want to continue to help them, or go look for a job to pay them.  Ultimately, you did borrow and did promise to pay it all back.  Let Karma deal with them if they can't appreciate all you've done for them over the last year...",
