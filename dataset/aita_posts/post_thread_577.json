Explain to her that you don't have an unlimited service plan with your phone but that you *occasionally* use ______ (Skype, Discord, or some similar thing), and she can contact you that way.  Tracphone has that type of service (for instance 1500 minutes and X-number of texts) in case she asks, and you simply state that you reserve the texts for your parents, grandparents, etc.",

Since, as you said, your time near this person is limited, I suggest that you just continue to dodge attempts to get closer and then move on once you're out of close contact. ",
