This morning I was watching a movie with her family while my girlfriend was at work. I haven\u2019t always been able to bond with her family like this so I was quite excited to be hanging out with them without my girlfriend needing to be around. \n\nThe rest of my family is staying at my grandparents house which includes my mother, step dad, uncle, uncles now financ\u00e9e, grandma and grandpa. \n\nHalfway through the movie I get a FaceTime call from my uncle. Which is kind of odd but I didn\u2019t wanna be rude and answer a FaceTime call in the middle of the movie we were enjoying. So I ignore it and he FaceTimes me again. At this point I\u2019m thinking oh it\u2019s probably some Christmas gag he\u2019s put together, so I text him saying \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d He just FaceTimes me again. So I text my mother who\u2019s also there saying \u201cwhat\u2019s going on? I don\u2019t wanna be rude and interrupt the movie\u201d Nobody would tell me what\u2019s going on, which made me believe it wasn\u2019t some sort of emergency just something silly that they wanted to fill me in on. If it was an emergency I know my mom would call me to tell me so. \n\nAt this point my uncle has tried FaceTiming me 5 times and I\u2019m getting annoyed so I texted my mother saying \u201cI\u2019ll call you later I\u2019m turning my phone off\u201d. So I turn my phone on airplane mode. \n\n About half an hour later and the movie being done I got up to call my mom. And she yelled at me for being selfish and how I ruined such a great thing. And again nobody has actually told me what is going and and all I know is that I\u2019ve ruined some sort of gag that my uncle put together. \n\nShortly after my uncle called me to tell me he\u2019s now engaged to his partner. And he was trying to FaceTime me so I could watch the proposal. \n\nI can accept that I could have stepped out of the room to take the call. But I was happily enjoying a movie and some bonding time with my girlfriends family. Just sucks that I was given absolutely no heads up as to what was going on. \n\nIt\u2019s shitty all around I can accept that, I just now feel like a mega asshole. Most of the family texted me saying how selfish I was for not picking up the phone and that I made it all about me. \n\n\n\nTLDR: My uncle was trying to FaceTime me so I could watch him propose to his girlfriend while I was missing the family get together. Me not knowing that anything was going on told him I\u2019d call him later.",

So we have dinner where she already has more than a strong sneaky suspicion and as we're walking around a busy downtown entertainment district, I see about half the friends that we invited to celebrate with us afterwards walking towards the bar we're meeting up at after the question, even after I had told them all the times to be where and the route we were gonna take for the night. One person even had to run across the middle of a busy ass street to avoid running directly into us.\n\nPoint is: I sympathize with the uncle and OP is not really an asshole for it, but it was certainly impolite to not at least answer one of the facetimes to see what was clearly very important",

I mean, getting the woman I love to say yes would be what would matter to me. Not so much whether my nephew could see it on FaceTime. \n\nAgain, if somehow his need to include his nephew in his proposal is so devastating, he really should have thought it through better.",

In an era where we have text-based instantaneous messaging, where you can respond at your own pace (be that immediately or at a later point, or even not at all), a phone call is an interruption. It's not a positive connection, it is a demand to be present and available then and there, for who knows how long. \n\nHonestly, I believe your uncle is TA because who the fuck needs an audience to propose? Was an audience of 4 not enough? Why did he need to include you in the moment vs just telling you the good news afterwards? Why couldn't he have said, \"hey, can you be available for a call at 11am?\". But I think another factor might be the difference in phone attitude between generations. Maybe they thought you would see a phone call from your family on Christmas as something you'd be excited to receive, not an interruption to the day you were having.",
