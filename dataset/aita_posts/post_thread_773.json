  "post content": " \n\nThis started like two weeks ago. My friend (14M) and I (14M) were going to hang out at a McDonald\u2019s but something happened with my mom at work so I had to take my little sister (10F) with me. My friend was annoyed because he didn\u2019t want to babysit and so that sucked for him, but it got worse when he started making fun of her for having \u201ccat eyes\u201d because of how big they were. This upset her and I told him to stop but he didn\u2019t. After he said \u201ccat eyes\u201d for like the fiftieth time, I just started meowing at him. We did this for a while and he knocked it off and it was funny for a while. It ended up being a fun day in the end.\n\nThe next time at school I saw him in algebra and he asked me about my cat-eyed sister. I started meowing at him and we did this for a while. Then the next time I saw him in the hall I meowed at him again. I also did it when I saw him in the bathrooms and also since we have four classes together, I did it every time I saw him.  After about three days he told me to stop but I didn\u2019t want to. I\u2019ve basically been meowing every time I see him and he\u2019s been trying to avoid me, but considering we have 4 classes together he\u2019s going to have a rough time.\n\nI think the biggest issue came up about two days ago when we had a group presentation that was assigned last month. We had to talk for ninety seconds for each of our parts and I got nervous and talked to fast. So to fill up time I just meowed. Some people found it funny, some people found it stupid. My teacher told me to be better prepared, but my friend yelled at me in the hallways afterwards for humiliating him in front of the class. Which I didn\u2019t, because I meowed at my classmates, not him this time. \n\nMy sister thinks it is funny. Nobody else does. One of my other friends (15M) said I should go here so I did. AITA? Thank you.\n\nPS: My other friend told me that \u2153 posts get deleted for being too weird because of Rule 8 and he thinks this is too weird. According to him \u201cthere\u2019s some pedantic redditors who refer to r/thathappened every time something unordinary happens. therefore you will be required to provide evidence.\u201d Can someone tell me what this means? What counts as evidence? I have emails between me and my friend arguing about this. Do I attach them here?",
