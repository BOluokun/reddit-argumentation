  "post content": "Context, we\u2019re from the UK. I am struggling to see why we are the assholes as deemed by my parents and sister. My husband uses Reddit and thought this sub would provide a third insight that we are missing.\n\nMy husband (42M) and I (40F) have 2 daughters: Jane (22F) and Lisa (5F). This concerns Jane who has been struggling with the cold.\n\nJane started to complain about the temperature of the house now it\u2019s no longer summertime. Currently, we leave the central heating off all the time apart from in the early morning (5-7am) so Lisa doesn\u2019t get too cold when she is awake. My husband and I don\u2019t have an issue with the temperature of the house (its approx 16C at night across all of the bedrooms since we checked in case her room was draftier), we don\u2019t really feel it and do not see where Jane is coming from. Jane complains and says she wears multiple layers to bed and around the house while we are all asleep.\n\nSo, she asked if she could have access to the thermostat in order to switch the heating on at a higher temperature than 18C (what we set it as). She wants to raise it to 21C but we said no. She keeps complaining about how she has to wear 4 layers to bed so she doesn\u2019t feel cold in the morning. Lisa says it isn\u2019t cold when we ask her, my husband and I also don\u2018t feel the cold so we said no to her asking and thought that would put an end to it.\n\nIt did not. We had dinner at my parents house in which Jane was making comments about how warm and toasty her grandparents\u2019 house is. My parents were shocked that we didn\u2019t allow her access to the thermostat and they tried to sway us into giving her access because it isn\u2019t right for her to sleep in multiple layers. My sister also agreed with them and said my daughter has valid points since the temperature is starting to drop in the night.\n\nAre we wrong here?\n\n  \n\n\nHello everyone and thank you for all your feedback. I did not realise there were so many reasons as to why my daughter potentially could be cold and that layering may not work in those cases. We reached a compromise with our daughter: she can have a small heater for her room with a timer so I am 100% sure it is not left on overnight for my own peace of mind. We are also going to buy her a heavier duvet and thicker mattress topper to prevent cold from underneath the bed. Thank you all. ",

I see you're not interested in keeping the heat on consistently either, so that's miserable for her as well. Why do you think she should suffer so you can save a few dollars on the power bill? Also, the things most folks are suggesting (heating blankets, space heaters, etc) actually use more electric than just keeping your house a comfortable and consistent temperature. Expecting her to have 4+ layers to be moderately warm is unreasonable.",

I lived in a one-bedroom, the other was a 3-bedroom. In the 3-bedroom, the ladies renting that thought that they would save money by using space heaters in their bedrooms at night rather than turning on the gas heat. Color me shocked when I got a $700 electric bill! The mix-up was cleared up, but then they were on the hook for that. We (me and the girls in that apartment) talked about why their bill was so high, and they swore up and down they were only running the space heaters at night, in their bedrooms with the doors closed. And this was a bill for mid-October to mid-November, so not even really that cold (highs in the upper 50's-upper 60's, lows not really going below 40).\n\nSo let's math here. My electric bill was around $50 for that time. That ran all the same stuff as them, minus the space heaters (plus a smidge for the furnace fan, but those don't actually take much electricity, and mine didn't run much because it wasn't \\*that\\* cold). Let's (generously, their appliances were newer than mine and roommates will often cook at the same time...I always did that when I had roommates...\"Oh, hey, you're using the oven, can I stick my dish in there, too?\") say they used 3x that for lighting, entertainment, cooking, etc., since there were 3 of them, for a $150 \"expected\" bill. They spent $550 heating 3 bedrooms only at night, for a cost of $183 per bedroom. And, again, in \"cool,\" but not COLD weather!\n\nI have never...NEVER...had a utility bill as large as they did for a single bedroom! When all my windows sucked (they were 57 years old and so bad that snow would sometimes get between them and the plastic!) and were covered in shrink-wrap plastic to \"get through\" until I could get them replaced, my gas+electricity ran around $175/month for a 1600 square foot house (with the new windows and doors, it runs less than $100 in even the coldest weather)! My solar panels were installed before my first summer here, but running the numbers, if I was paying full board for my electricity, my biggest bill ever would have been around $150, using central A/C to 76 during waking hours!",

If we\u2019re having a super hot summer, we pull the drapes to block light and heat coming in and occasionally turn the temp up to be kinder to our bills *and* the environment. \n\nI grew up in a cold, drafty house as a kid. I slept in multiple layers, under multiple blankets and was always cold in fall, winter and much of spring. We used generators (no electricity to the property for years and years) and they got turned off at night to rest them, so no electric blankets or space heaters. It was fucking cold! No air conditioning either so you\u2019d feel every single miserable degree of heat or cold. \n\nI\u2019m going to be 50 this year and we finally bought a house with central air. It\u2019s a comfy 68F right now. I\u2019m under a single blanket on my extra comfy bed. A single layer of clothing. No need for socks! \n\nFor the other commenters with circulation/cold issues, I\u2019m there with you. I\u2019m a T-7 paraplegic and my body can\u2019t regulate temperature below the injury line or from the bra band down. I have to monitor my legs and torso for warmth, make sure I\u2019m not too hot or too cold and it can be exhausting. Now that the temp is the same year \u2018round, my life is so much better. \n\nI hope everyone is able to find comfort, warmth and cool when needed.

To offset it, my mom got all of us nice down comforters. This, with sheet and bedcover kept us warm. Nowadays I have the most comfortable sleep with the window open and stay warm with my comforter. We also have a springtime midlayer for our beds in lieu of the comforter. Often I would keep this under the comforter. Even if temps were under 14 I'd  kick off a top layer for being too warm. Around the house I got used to wearing a sweatshirt and wraping myself in a wool blanket if it is especially cold. I also have a heated blanket (but I only really use it when I'm playing games on my computer). I'm older now and I truly believe cold endurance helps the health of anyone, but when you need to be warm you should have options. Sometimes all it takes is a shower, others a comforter, wool blanket, or heated blanket.",
