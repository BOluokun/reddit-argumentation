  "post content": "\nVague title but, that\u2019s as summed up as i could make the situation. \n\nThe situation in more detail is that i borrowed two books for one of my friends from my university library because she needed it for an essay. I had finished the semester and went out to my library for the explicit purpose of getting her these books, and despite the fact that she is part of \u201cUoL\u201d (universities of london) and can therefore freely come and go to my uni library anyway, i still went in person and got the books for her as a favour. About a week later she tells me she\u2019s done and asks me to return it for her, and gives it to me when we meet one day. \n\nNow at the time i was a bit annoyed that i\u2019d have to inconvenience myself by going all the way to my uni library when she could literally return it herself (she worked like a 10 minute walk from the library), but i agreed anyway and took the books. That was my mistake, i should\u2019ve asked her to do it herself, but whatever. \n\nI couldn\u2019t find the time to return the books since i had to go on a month holiday literally four days after, so i told myself to remember to renew the books online once a week until i came back and could return it, and that\u2019s what i kept trying to do for the next month and for weeks after that, but i naturally forgot several times. Because of that, i managed to rack up around \u00a310  in late fees, which is annoying but it was worse because that brought my total late fees up to the max of \u00a330, meaning i had to pay it all immediately as opposed to at the end of my three years at uni. \n\nThat sucked tbh, especially because in the back of my mind i kept thinking this wouldn\u2019t be happening if she returned the book herself, because again, she literally worked ten minutes from my library while i haven\u2019t gone back to that area of the city in the last three months because it\u2019s so out of the way.\n\nBut, like i said this was all just in the back of my mind. I came back from my holiday and still kept putting off going and returning the book because let\u2019s be honest, i was lazy, and i subsequently kept forgetting to renew it. it\u2019s *my* fault i realise, but one day me and this friend were talking and i jokingly complained about how much i\u2019m being inconvenienced by these damn books and her tone kind of annoyed me, because she was completely refusing to see how it was any of her business. I told her she could\u2019ve returned it herself in the first place, but she was like \u201ci don\u2019t know how your library works so that\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be possible\u201d, which is just dumb because who doesn\u2019t know how libraries work? I just think if i was in her position i\u2019d feel a little bit bad uno? MAYBE even offer to pay it, but she didn\u2019t, so now i\u2019m kind of mad at her. \n\nIs this anger justified? am i the asshole for feeling like she should take *a little bit* of responsibility for this?\n\nEDIT: you guys have spoken and i pretty much knew the way this would turn out as soon as i hit send. I\u2019m just not justified feeling like this, and i knew that lol. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong in asking me, i just wanted to know if i\u2019m allowed to feel slighted by her not caring that i\u2019m in this situation because of her books, but i agreed to return them and that\u2019s ultimately all it comes down to. Thanks for those who replied.",

It sounds like you are actually mad at yourself for allowing her to leave the books with you. Maybe you feel a little taken advantage of? Maybe this is part of a pattern you get into with people where you say yes too frequently and that is where the frustration is coming from. The best thing to do is know better in the future how to establish boundaries with people. Maybe think a little more carefully before saying yes to people. Remember, you teach others how to treat you.  \n\n\nBottom line. She made a request and you said yes. She made a second request and you said yes. Then you screwed up and it cost you money. You are allowed to feel upset privately but you should not be blaming or expecting anything from her. YTA",
