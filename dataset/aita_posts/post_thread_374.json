  "post content": "I (26F) have been with my boyfriend Sean (25M) for about a year and a half. It's been great, but I let him know from the outset that I was a recovering alcoholic. He had no problem with that, and he still drinks with his friends, but won't do that in my presence. It still bothers me that he drinks, but it's his life, I can't tell him what to do.\n\nFast forward to last Sunday, and we're at his apartment. I come in, and he's in the middle of making pasta sauce, and there's a large bottle of vodka on the counter. I didn't say anything about the bottle, but he saw me staring at it, and he told me it's for the sauce.\n\nPasta sauce he's made me at least twice a month for the entirety of our relationship.\n\nHe said he's told me from the beginning he does that, that it cooks away, but I think that would be something I would very much remember, and I got a little angry. I knocked the bottle off the counter and went to my mom's.\n\nHe's called and apologized for triggering me, and that he was being brainless, but he wants me to pay for the broken bottle, which he says was about an $80 brand. I told him that I wasn't under any circumstances going to pay for something he's been lacing my food with for years.\n\nWe haven't really talked since, and my mom wants me to just go ahead and buy the thing to make amends, and I'm still refusing. AITA?\n\nEdit: I didn't smash the bottle, I pushed it off the counter and it broke. I didn't throw it.  \nEdit2: alright, I get it. I'm going to get him $80 worth of stuff to make up for it. But I really don't appreciate being called violent or abusive. I've never hit him once, and I think that's a pretty rash assumption.  \n",

Why? First of all, let\u2019s look at what the research says. If you add wine, or any other source of alcohol to a boiling liquid, and then stop cooking it by removing it from the heat, 85% of the alcohol will remain. This is the point where most people seem to stop recounting the facts. However, if you continue simmering for 15 minutes, 40% of the alcohol will remain. That means that 60% of the alcohol is gone (this counts as most, in my book). After around half an hour, 35% will remain. After one hour, 25%. One and a half hours, 20%. Two hours, 10%. Two and a half, 5%. As you continue simmering, there are diminishing returns on the alcohol removal, but after 3 hours it is safe to say that most of the alcohol is gone. Different methods of cooking, and when, precisely, you add the alcohol, will change the amount lost and the time it takes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\naccording to the USDA you would need to bake or simmer a dish/sauce for up to 2.5 hours  to get rid of 95% of alcohol. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nnow, you Arnt going to get drunk, unless you're adding a ton, and eating a ton, but  in most dishes that are prepared with alcohol, you are going to consuming some actually alcohol, not just the flavor.",

A *big* part of the recovery process is learning to accept that you *can't* actually tell people not to have alcohol in your presence. That it's not your right to control what other people do, and it's not their responsibility to remove temptations from your life. It's *your* responsibility to not slip back into addictive behaviour.\n\nOP doesn't seem to be grasping this yet. They're actively upset that their partner still drinks, and they smashed a bottle because they found out there was alcohol in their presence.Methinks they are *not* as recovered as they think they are. This sounds like someone who is still very much in the throes of addiction, who is still trying to deflect and make it everyone else's responsibility to ensure they don't drink.  \n OP: It is *your* responsibility. No one else's. Your addiction is *your* problem, not your partner's. Until you get that through your head, you will never recover.",

It puts you in fear for your physical safety. It\u2019s going to make you more likely to do what the person wants, in order to save yourself from being hit with a flying object. It\u2019s going to make you develop a vigilance and watchfulness, make your muscles tense, and physically cause you to do things like recoil in fear or run and hide. \n\nSo IMHO this is both psychological and physical abuse. I say this because a lot of people tend to elevate physical abuse above other kinds of abuse, or tell themselves it wasn\u2019t physical abuse if they weren\u2019t hit, but that doesn\u2019t follow with how we generally treat violence. One way I think of it is to think about how we define crimes. In criminal law generally, crimes often do not distinguish between actual physical violence used and a threat of violence. Like they tend to be written to say something like the crime was committed \u201cby force or threat of force.\u201d \n\nArmed robbery is a good example of a serious crime that often does not involve direct physical violence\u2014holding a gun on someone might not result in any actual physical injuries, but the impact of that threat of physical violence is very real, both psychologically and physically. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to say that what you described sounds terrifying and awful, and that I agree with your sarcasm about your dad\u2019s gaslighting to minimize the seriousness of it that\u2019s implied in your comment.

That's your right., It's that you're wrong for how you dealt with it.\n\nYou were wrong to break the bottle of vodka, whether it was a $20 or an $80 bottle. The cost isn't the point. The point is that it's his property, his intentions were good, and you destroyed it in a violent way. Destruction of property is actually on the road to an abusive relationship, so yeah, you need to apologize, and to pay for it.\n\nI get that being a recovering alcoholic is hard & you panicked when you saw that bottle, but you could've asked him not to put even boiled-out vodka in the sauce in the future.
