  "post content": "On mobile, bad formatting - sorry. Also maybe a little long but all relevant. Edits have been added to address common responses and things people felt I had left out. I'm happy to answer any questions.\n\nSo, I have been involved in my stepdaughters life since she was a baby (I'm not a homewrecker - she was a happy accident from a one night stand before I met him). I already had one child and so I was very keen, and used my experience to help him with everything when he had her for a few days per week (BC he was pretty clueless). I treated her like she was my own and was as emotionally invested in everything to that degree. \n\n[Edit: she lives with her mother and is with us for 2 - 3 days per week. I am not her primary \"mother figure\" - I know this, and that's not the point here. It seems like being a step-parent in  the UK is different from other places]\n\nWhen she was 4 I was trying to organise our Christmas with her, sort out gifts, time with her grandmother etc. Things were difficult and I was getting upset, and at one point my husband said to me \"I don't know why you're so bothered, she's not even your daughter anyway\" - and it really hurt me, like cut me to the core, because I had given everything to help raise this child for the last 4 years. But I realised that yeah I had given too much and I needed to back off. So I did. \n\n[Edit: my husband is autistic, so he now sees no wrong in what he said as in a literal sense I am not her biological mum. However, when he said it at first, he meant it by way of \"you're too involved, she's my child not yours\" - I know this because we discussed it at the time.]\n\nShe is now almost 10 and very sassy. I have often been in charge of looking after her when she's visited (3 out of 4 weekends) over the last 2 / 3 years because of my husband's hobby. I have sucked it up until just before Covid when I could clearly see that she was becoming resentful that it was me looking after her and not her father. So things started to change and he became more involved, because I made him. Then Covid happened and so now he's here all the time.\n\nWhen she has an issue with her siblings or whatever, I now direct her to talk to her father because I feel like it is his duty to resolve it - and sometimes he's better anyway because I can have a short fuze. \n\nToday she came downstairs, started to complain about something our son had done an hour before. I told her to talk to her father, things started to escalate so I said I was going to time out, and I left the room (BC that's our family plan.) She storms upstairs and slams the bedroom door a few times.  Husband comes to the bottom of the stairs and shouts at her to come down - she refuses. He says for her to stay up there all day then. Then he comes to the bedroom to discuss it with me. (Which he shouldn't do when I'm time out)\n\n[Edit: my son had gone upstairs shouting for his older sister - he hadn't specifically done anything to her but he woke her up. Apparently this was an important thing to add. Also, I do try to talk to her about any issues but if she doesn't want to hear it or I can't resolve it then I tell her to talk to her father, because I don't want to overstep the mark.]\n\nIt emerges that he wants me to sort things out with her because it was me who got angry in the first place. I said no, BC he is the one who shouted etc, and she's not my daughter. Husband says I keep bringing that up because of what he said before and that I'm bitter. He is partly right, I have said it a few times in the past, but I do it to remind him that I'm not doing what I feel is his job, because of what he said to me before. He made it clear it's not my responsibility. And yeah it still really hurts when I think back to when it originally happened. \n\nSo AITA in this situation? And what do I do?\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add, I haven't completely stepped off! I am still very much involved and I feel that I do more for her than her father does. She gets the same from me as my biological children do, but I was getting crap for everything so I tried to drag her father in more. Our family situation is bloody complex so it's not as black and white as is I wsh it was, but I appreciate everyone's responses.\n\nSecond edit: WOW! Ok I need to clarify, I don't just refuse to talk to her when she comes to me with a problem. I think I probably made that sound wrong. I do talk to her, but if she's not happy with my decision or what I have to say then I refer her to her father. I'm not some cold bitch who is saying not my problem, go see dad! Like this morning, I said look, it's been an hour so it can't have bothered you that much. She wasn't happy with that so I said well go and tell your father then. Cue her getting stroppy with me and me saying \"ok rather than argue, I'm going to take 5 minutes out of here\"\n\nEdit: we are having therapy because our situation is complex. My husband has ASD and son had ADHD. However this is something that has only started in the last few weeks. The \"time out\" is part of a gradual system we will be using to affect positive behaviour changes in our household.",

Alternative family dynamics are certainly difficult so I think the best thing to do is discuss with your husband what role you would like to take in your step-daughter's life.",
