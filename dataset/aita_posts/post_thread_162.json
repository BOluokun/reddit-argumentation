  "post content": "A friend of mine is an artist and has been doing an evening class in textiles. This term they\u2019re making a dress. The instructor said they wouldn\u2019t have enough of those tailor\u2019s dummies and would anyone be able to use a live model. My friend volunteered and messaged me to see if I\u2019d be able to help and I agreed. \n\nSo a couple times a week I\u2019ve been going to his to have this dress fitted and altered and happily being pricked with little pins *its been a learning curve*. \n\nAnyway, the other night we were at a party. Me, him and friend (B) were chatting about the dress and she exclaimed that she was so excited to have it. Que my confusion. Honestly, I\u2019d kinda assumed that he would want to keep it as a memento or he\u2019d need to submit it or something. I\u2019d have wanted to be offered. It\u2019s literally a dress tailored to my exact measurements and B and I are not the same size. She\u2019d have to get it altered anyway which IMO loses what\u2019s special about the dress. I\u2019ve also given up a lot of my time the last few weeks to help with the project, and we\u2019re only half way there! \n\nClearly, I didn\u2019t hide my reaction very well because she immediately said \u201chey, I asked first!\u201d (INFO - we are in our late twenties, not 12yo). He awkwardly shrugged and agreed that she asked first. \n\nSo when I next went over I told him that I was a little caught off guard that he\u2019d said she can have it. I pointed out her needing it to be altered and that it would mean a lot to me considering we\u2019d worked on it together. He agreed and said it was all mine when finished.\n\nHe must have messaged her when I left because shortly after I get two angry messages from her, literally calling me an A-hole. So, what better place to ask, AITA?\n\nINFO - the reason I hadn\u2019t asked for the dress was because I had assumed he was keeping it or would need it for his course. Hadn\u2019t even occurred to me that he\u2019d be giving it away.",

Off-the-rack clothing is made to fit an \"average\" body, which no one has. Altering your clothes can be an effective way of making you look expensive and put together, without actually being that expensive. \n\nEx. Men often wear shirts where the shoulder seam doesn't sit on their actual shoulder, because they needed to go up in size for a larger chest or belly. They can get the shoulder seam altered and look like they bought a custom shirt worth hundreds and it's only ~15 or 20 bucks.",

The king, naturally, had the biggest house, his being the only one in the kingdom to have two floors; a tricky bit of engineering for an all natural structure.\n\nEach year the king, on his birthday, would receive a new throne from his people - the first year they made him a wooden one from the finest trees in the forest. The year after, they had managed to find some tin and bronze, so made him a very happy king. Each year, the old throne would get taken upstairs to the storage as the king liked to walk amongst the collection and reminisce over years gone by.\n\nSo ten years had passed, and by now the nation of hut dwellers had become rich enough to buy gold. So this year, the king received a mighty throne. So his old one was taken away upstairs, the huge gold throne hauled in, and another year in the kingdom commenced.\n\nThis eleventh year however, was a tough year for the harvest. The sun belted down on the blacksmiths as they made swords and shields for the loyal warriors that protected the realm. They worked tirelessly for a month to make the biggest and most lavishly adorned throne anyone had ever seen.\n\nSo the king had his party, the new throne was presented. The grand entrance was only just big enough to get the throne through- but the skill and knowledge of the smiths made it possible.\n\nThe golden throne was taken upstairs to join the other nine from years gone by.\n\nThat night there was a tragic disaster- the whole royal family was killed as they slept, the whole place collapsed around them. The queen was dead, the heirs were crushed, and a new king was needed for the country. It was a sad night.\n\n*What is the moral of the story?*\n\n*Those who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.*\n\n[Credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/11i6pj/the_king_and_the_thrones/) to u/squeaki, though I was told this one by my corny old botany professor nearly two decades ago.

Ask if there is any additional discount coupon in a store? That's expected and can pay off. Ask a person you met if they'll go out with you? Sure.\n\nAsk someone you are eating with \"are you going to eat that\" before the meal is over makes them feel like they should give it to you even if they were going to finish it. Asking for favors from friends and neighbors all the time without doing as many things back that they appreciate, is not fair. Asking for a loan from a friend? Never, unless, of course, it's like $5 you need and you pay it back right away, like within a day. But not a real loan, tho.\n\nAbout the dogs, better to wait just a minute to see if the owner suggests you do or don't pet. Some owners know that their dog can bite but are reluctant to turn you down. That one is more a matter of safety.\n\nAsk an artist for a dress halfway through it being made when you know there is a person it will fit perfectly who is giving her time to the artist for fittings.

It would be so cool to wear a dress you made.\" That's polite enough, but Artist Friend really should have considered OP at this point, and said \"I'll ask OP if she wants it because it's fitted to her, but if she says no, it's yours.\"\n\nIt is also a faux pas to ask Artist Friend to break his promise, but I'm giving OP a pass on this one because he shouldn't have promised it to B without considering whether she would have wanted it. And I totally give OP a pass for not asking for the dress because, like I said, it would have been a bit of a faux pas to ask for a gift that large and put Artist Friend in an awkward place of not wanting to say no even if he really wanted to keep it.",

It would have been fine for OP to ask her friend what his plans were for the dress, now that I think of it, but I guess it hadn't occurred to her to ask until she found out it was being given away. \nI also sympathize with how she must have felt to hear that B was getting the dress, like \"do you see me as a second-class friend? Did you never consider whether I would want it?\" I even suspect that if Artist had asked OP to help him make a dress for B (with that stated purpose) she might have agreed to help, but the way the news came out, it made OP feel like, even though she was going out of her way to help Artist, B was his favored friend and he never considered OP's feelings.",

I totally agree that it would have been a faux pas, but OP gave no indication that she knew that or considered that. She said she just never considered asking for it (because of some assumptions, but I don't think she actually considered why she never asked for the dress until she realized, \"O shit, she's getting it?! I have more claim than she does!\" ...paraphrasing and making assumptions on her verbage, I know.) I say that because an even bigger faux pas (much, much bigger IMHO) is how she handled the situation after finding out B was getting the dress. So I don't think she gives a tiny rat butt about social gaffes.",
