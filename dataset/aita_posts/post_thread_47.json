  "post content": "Me and my fiancee (22m & 23f) had our baby girl Thalia and she just turned 9 months old. Everyone in our family has been coming around more to see her. Two months ago we stopped talking to my parents after they pulled some shit. \nWe basically decided it was gonna be up to Thalia when she older if she wants to get her ears pierced. Tbh I was never into the idea of it being done as a baby when they can\u2019t consent, like my fianc\u00e9e parents pierced her ears when she was a baby and she always hated wearing earrings. Still doesn\u2019t wear any. \n\nJust like every other parent that was our decision not to do it to her while she\u2019s a baby. My parents didn\u2019t shut up about it for a while saying \u201cshe\u2019d look so cute.\u201d But we told them already no and that\u2019s our answer. When they babysat for us once they got one of my mom\u2019s friends to do it and we were fucking pissed they went behind our backs. We stopped talking to them after that for disrespecting our decision. Everyone was saying we were making a big deal and we can\u2019t cut them out their granddaughters life over something like that.\n\nSo we decided they\u2019re allowed to only see Thalia when one of us is around and they won\u2019t be left alone with her. That\u2019s where everyone is still saying we\u2019re being massive a-holes because we\u2019re still punishing them over something that\u2019s not a big deal and we\u2019re treating them like children. Even my fianc\u00e9es parents think that only letting them have supervised visits is too much and they should be allowed to babysit or have Thalia at their place alone like before. \nWe\u2019re still not wanting to change our minds on our conditions so it\u2019s pinning everyone against us. Are we being assholes that we just don\u2019t trust them alone with her and rather one of us be there always?",

Every time the same thing happened: My ears would swell up until I looked like Dumbo, there'd be a horrible thing infection & I'd get a fever.\n\nMy daddy finally put his foot down about it & said no more.\n\nWhen I was 14, I decided for myself that I wanted earrings. We went to a *real* piercer (which was funny tbh. Imagine Hank Hill visiting a tattoo parlor. LOL) & explained what had happened when I was a kid.\n\nThey're the ones who told me about nickel allergies & how common they are. (I was later tested & yup. Positive.)\n\nThey felt my lobes & told us I had so much scar tissue that they weren't completely sure they would heal right. I said that was fine & I still wanted to try. They used titanium studs & it worked!\n\nHowever! My original holes are STILL, nearly 30yrs later, prone to closing up very quickly if I don't wear earrings every day. That scar tissue prevents them from EVER fully healing.\n\nSo that's fun. \u0ca0_\u0ca0\n\nMy daughter is 8. I've already told her no earrings until she's at least 12.",

It isn't their baby, they do not get to make these decisions, and they sure as hell don't get to override the decisions of the actual parents without consequences.\n\nHonestly, them being allowed around her at all is beyond generous already, they need to count their blessings that they're even allowed near your daughter.\n\nIf you haven't already, remove the earrings and let the ears heal over - your babies ears will change over time and piercings done when you're a baby can grow to be off-centre later in life. Also, if it was done with a piercing gun instead of properly with a needle, it could result in permanent damage to the earlobe, best to let it heal over properly and let your daughter decide when she's old enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> My parents didn\u2019t shut up about it for a while saying \u201cshe\u2019d look so cute.\u201d  \n\nYour parents are treating your baby like a fashion accessory, they need to respect her right as a person to have bodily autonomy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Everyone was saying we were making a big deal and ***we can\u2019t cut them out their granddaughters life over something like that.*** \n\nI mean - if you wanted to, you absolutely could. You're the parents, either your family respects your decisions and your daughters right to make her own choices later in life, or they don't get to see her. What are they going to do about it? If they don't want to lose access to their granddaughter maybe they should be more respectful of your decisions. The only power the rest of your family holds here is the power to guilt trip - they cannot force you to give them access to your baby. Whether or not they have the privilege of seeing her is entirely up to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> everyone is still saying we\u2019re being massive a-holes because we\u2019re still punishing them over something that\u2019s not a big deal and we\u2019re treating them like children.    \n>  \n> my fianc\u00e9es parents think that only letting them have supervised visits is too much and they should be allowed to babysit or have Thalia at their place alone like before. \n\nif it's 'not a big deal' then why was it a big enough deal for grandma and grandpa to go behind your back to do it? If it's so unimportant, then why were they so upset about your not piercing your daughters ears that they decided to do it themselves? The only ones who made a 'big deal' out of anything is your parents by going against your explicitly stated wishes.\n\nhere's the thing, OP. it ***is*** a big deal - but because your opinion, in their eyes, is the 'wrong' one they are saying in a very roundabout way that your *feelings* on it aren't a big deal. That's why they went behind your back to do it. They knew it was wrong, they knew you said no, they just didn't care and decided to ask forgiveness rather than get permission. \n\nThe long and short of it is this: They're calling you assholes for daring to give them consequences for their actions. They will *continue* to call you assholes for this until you either give them full and unsupervised access to your daughter whenever they want again or until you make it clear as can be to them that they can't bully you into getting access to your daughter.\n\nYou need to put your foot down on this OP, they've already harassed you back into letting your parents have some interaction - they have, whether or not you intended them to, received the message that with enough bullying and harassing you will give in - even if just a little. You gave an inch, and they are now trying to take a mile - you and your wife need to shut this shit down hard yesterday unless you want to deal with this kind of stuff for another 18 years. Block numbers if you need to, but you need to send them a new message: one that says you will not be bullied into compliance with *their* wishes about **your** daughter and that attempts to do so result in loss of access to her.",

They are more or less saying they might pull something similar or do it again! I include the grandparents' defenders and friends in this; I would honestly be saying to fiancee's parents that you're alarmed they are backing such a move and hope, for the sake of their own access, that you're misunderstanding that they are ok with treating your child like a toy. Actions speak louder than words here. \"Guess what, we care more about our daughter than your approval! And, hey...we tried supervised access and not only is that not good enough you're making us more worried about your behavior than ever.
