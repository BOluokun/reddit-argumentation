  "post content": "Ok so I'm in middle school and have 2 sets of friend groups one I'm starting to slowly drift away from but I am still close with 3 of them. Anyway I'm big on indoor skydiving as in I have more then 5 hours clocked in the chamber that's just minimum most likely more. \n\nSo the place I indoor skydive has 3 options.\n\n 1 buy it when you get there (least amount of time able to buy) \n\n\n2buy a ticket then go whenever you want (still provides a good amount of time) \n\nAnd 3 schedule a class which gives the best amount of time.\n\nSo I usually do schedule cause it's best amount of time for money. And my friend knows how big I am on indoor skydiving. So I got it scheduled in around December cause they had good deals then. And got a bunch of flights scheduled in advance. One just so happened to be 2 months away on my friends birthday.\n\nNow you would think hey just reschedule it right? Here's the thing that sucks if you book in advance and it's a private session you cant reschedule which is one the thing you sign when booking in advance. The only way you can reschedule is unless you do it within a month of the reservation. And I wasn't told the final details until about 2 weeks before the party.\n\nSo I told him and he got pissed (which is very unlike him) and we got in an argument. After 5min unsaid i dont really feel like talking about this and he agreed. The next day we talked and he said he was sorry and was already in a bad mood. But he added I was an ass hole for choosing not to go and to go to a hobby instead. I explained to him what I explained above and also said I still got him a gift (I was going to). So now I have to choose between a +300 dollar lesson or his birthday. \n\nSo after the argument and my lesson I'm really considering not going so wibta?",

      "content": "NAH/INFO. It's reasonable for you not to want to forfeit a $300 class. It's also reasonable for your friend to be upset that you can't make his party. Even if you explained it, he probably heard \"I'm bailing on you because I would rather to skydiving\". \n\nIt depends on how close of a friend he is, and also how much you value his friendship. If he's your best friend you've known since you were 5, I would say this is kinda shitty. If you're not super close, it shouldn't be a big deal to not make it. \n\nWhy don't you schedule a time close to his birthday to take him out somewhere and hang out just the two of you? Like go out to a movie or bowling or something, and make sure you let him know before that you have a previous commitment on his birthday but still value his friendship and wanted to do something special.",

You\u2019ve had your plans for a long time and a true friend would be understanding of that.
