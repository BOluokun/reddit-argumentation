  "post content": "So let\u2019s rewind the tape to last week...\n\nMy wife gets a phone call from her aunt, who asks us to attend my wife\u2019s grandma\u2019s surprise birthday party in a couple of months.  Except they live over a 10 hour drive away, and the party is on a Friday night, so we would both need to take off work that day to make it.  My wife immediately wants to go and asks me if she thinks I could get off work.  I told her that I reckon I could, and so she tells her aunt to pencil us in.\n\nFast forward to today, and I open an invitation for my cousin\u2019s wedding for the same weekend...  a wedding that my wife and I were both looking forward to attending (we have three young kids, weddings are great date nights!).  She mentions that it\u2019s too bad we can\u2019t go since we\u2019re already going to her grandma\u2019s.\n\nAt this point, I fully realize the logistical nightmare that this birthday party is going to be...  missing work, the cost of gas, having to have my two oldest miss school, never mind traveling 10+ hours in the car with 3 young kids... all for people that I\u2019ve met twice in 8 years of being with my wife.  And then the regret hits me that I would be missing out on this beautiful evening in a picturesque venue with all of my family and quite a few of my friends.\n\nBut before I go too far down the rabbit hole of grandma-in-law dodging, I come up with a compromise - the party is Friday night, the wedding is Saturday night...  why not leave early Saturday so we can make it to the wedding?  I told my wife she could even stay home if she was too tired, and that either my mom or her mom would probably come help her with the kids so I could still go to the wedding with my dad (divorced parents).\n\nAlas, no dice.  She said it would be too grueling on the children to do all that traveling so close together and that we need a recuperation day in her grandma\u2019s town.  I agree with her, but I think it\u2019s going to be grueling regardless.  That moves our 10 hour drive to Sunday, and then that puts us back to work and the kids back to school with hardly any time to rejuvenate(it\u2019s almost imperative I have a day off between traveling and work to get resettled!).\n\nSo now we\u2019ve flown pass the discussion phase and straight into the arguing phase.  She accuses me of prioritizing my family over hers - and I agree with her.  Then I try to remind her as softly as possible of all the times that she told me she didn\u2019t care if we saw her family at the holidays and that she\u2019d rather see my side of the family.  At this point, she caves, and says we should go to the wedding instead.  If you\u2019re married though, you\u2019ll know this wasn\u2019t a real cave.  It was where I was supposed to relent and agree to go Grandma\u2019s birthday...  except I didn\u2019t.  And she went to bed angry.\n\nSo...  reddit, AITA here?",
