When I mail out my cards, I like to send them in different colored envelopes to stand out. The colors are red, blue, pink, green, and yellow. They are randomly picked and using different colors helps me remember who has what order. I have never gotten a complaint before and thought it was a great idea. So, when your letter arrives it\u2019s a fun experience instead of just getting a PWE. ( Plain White Envelope)\u00a0  \n\n\nI had an order for a card that was randomly put in a pink envelope and mailed off to the buyer. About a week or so later I get a message on eBay from the buyer asking me not to send him pink envelopes because pink is for girls, and he doesn\u2019t want his neighbors to see him carry in a pink letter. About a week goes by and I add more items to my eBay and this person bought more things from me. About ten different cards. I don\u2019t remember him from all the other orders, so one of his packages gets sent in a pink envelope. I had a lot of orders that week and a lot of people got pink envelopes along with different colors. I\u2019m also sure another one of his orders was sent in a blue one.  \n\n\nHe messages me again, furious that I have sent him another pink envelope. He informed me that he would not buy from me again if the next envelope was pink. His message also included \u201cI don\u2019t want another pink letter only sending me color associated with the American flag, so only red and blues. If it\u2019s on the gay flag, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d Weird because the pride flag is a rainbow, but I digress. He sent other things that he felt were associated with pink that he didn\u2019t want to be associated with, but I think we all get the point.  \n\n\nSo about two weeks later he orders about twenty cards, which is over the weight limit for eBay standard card shipping, so I broke his order down into separate orders. Cards were bought in different orders of five, so it was easy to do. I had a buy three get two free.   \n\n\nI decided I didn\u2019t want this person to go without his pink envelopes any longer, so I sent him five separate pink letters for his cards. Now, where I think I was being the A-hole was while talking to my girlfriend, she defended him, saying \u201che could have been in the closet, and you exposed him to his family.\u201d I tried to show her the messages where I don\u2019t think that is the case. So she changed it to \" He doesn't want to be made fun of by his neighbors and now he will.\" But now I feel bad that he did ask to not get them sent anymore, but I decided to be petty.   \n\n\nSo reddit AITA? \u00a0",
