  "post content": "My boyfriend (32) and I, (F,30) have been living together for around 3 years. He is going back to college at the end of the month to finish his Masters degree that he never was able to complete before we got together. \n\nI work a really good job that I love and for the most part, have been supporting us anyway, although he does contribute. Maybe like 20-25% of everything. This doesn't bother me at all, I'm happy to pay more as I earn more. Now he's going back to college for a year and won't be earning any money. The only reason he is going back he says, is because I can afford to support us for the year but honestly, I really don't see why I have to. We're not married (don't believe in it) and I really don't want kids, so it's not like eventually i'll have to support a family. I like money and sleep. I'm selfish, so sue me.\n\nAITA for not wanting to support him for a year? I'm pretty certain his parents would love to have him home for a year, but ofcourse at 32 I can understand why he wouldn't want to do that. This is a non-starter conversation for him. He says if he were to move back in with them, that we may as well break up. I wish he would have spoken to me about it before he quit his job otherwise I'd have said that I don't agree with it, would have suggested why not doing it part time so you could still work etc.\n\nI feel like i'm being taken advantage of. I broke up with my ex because I was supporting him 100% and I resented it after a while. It will literally drive me insane knowing that he's not getting up for work, and is running up the utility bills because he's going to be home all day. He'll be in college some days but will be home most of the time working on whatever it is he needs to do.\n\nEdit: so it's pretty equal on whether I am the a-hole or not, but from responses (thank you, whatever you said) I clearly need to clarify a few things.\n\n1. There was only ever a fleeting conversation when we were over at his parents and he said out of the blue, \"I'm thinking of finishing my masters\" his parents were so excited about it, and as it turns out, and they have retired with pretty substantial wealth, and have paid for him to go back to school. I found this out after calling them to voice my concerns. \n\n2. For those picking up on that 'I like money', I've been independent from my direct family since I was 17. I've been poor. REALLY poor. Making soup out tomato ketchup and hot water poor. Everything I have done has been so I can make my life as I want it. I work freelance and I'm really good at it, I'm not going to apologise for that. Also means that I have no back up if something was to happen to me, so my savings are for if/when that happens. \n\n3. My bf and I have had a conversation since I posted about this. I felt it was important. He still stands by if he was to go to his parents that we should break up. What I meant by him moving back to them for the year, that was when someone here said we would see each other when we could. His parents are closer to school and where we are is like 1.5 hours away. He's too proud for that though. \n\n4. Sure, whether he goes or stays my rent will be the same, but I'm not getting that 20-25% from which I've been able to save with my income. \n\n5. His masters is in something to do with English literature, and the job that he just quit, for all I knew he loved it. Now he's quit to do a (in my eyes) pointless masters? No. If it was medical school or engineering or a good job where he NEEDED a masters, I'd probably be more on board with it.\n\n6. He suffers from anxiety, and will only ever do anything he would be able to do. Which means no part time job.\n\n7. If we'd have actually talked and decided on this new path together, I would have no bones about it. But the arrogance and flippant nature of his attitude that I would foot the bill for a year has really upset and angered me. We're committed to each other and he pulls this on me? No.",

You have every right to set the terms under which you find your relationship acceptable and this may just be a previously-unknown incompatibility.\n\nThat being said, treating the completion of a degree the same as unemployment is a little weird. So is him quitting his job under the assumption you would support him without consulting you first. \n\nI'm definitely not a hard-and-fast advocate for marriage, but I wonder if part of the problem here is a matter of perspective. Not believing in marriage isn't the same as not believing in commitment and it's entirely possible that he sees this as investing in your collective future while you see it as him buying his future on your dime.",

It's quite different for him to take a year to finish a master's degree than it is to date someone who just doesn't work and is lazy. I think YTA is appropriate, as if you're gonna have him move in with his parents just go ahead and break up with him.",
