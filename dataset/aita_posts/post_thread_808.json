  "post content": "so i live in a small apartment with 3 other young college students. we all agreed to share kitchen things like pots and pans. the rule usually is that u need to wash ur things within 24 hours (we mark our dirty dishes so we can keep track of which belongs to who). if someone really needs that pan while its still dirty, they can either ask the person to quickly clean it, or just do it themselves if the person cant right now. \n\nso, i recently joined a meal kit service. i cook 4 times a week and i always start at 5pm, usually finishing around 6pm. all of my roommates eat much later in the evening at sporadic times. except the other day, one roommate Sally (fake name) was going to have friends over and cook for them. i told her she can have the kitchen after 6. she says she NEEDS the big pan (the only big pan, one i bought) so could i please wash it right after i cook? i said sure. \n\ni actually finish cooking at 5:40. the big pan was still hot. since i had 20 minutes until the agreed time, i decided i wanted to eat first before cleaning the pan, i was starving and wanted to enjoy my warm food. the minute i sat down, Sally got pissed. she asked if i would clean the pan before i ate. i said no, we agreed on 6 so i have time to eat before i clean it. she says no we agreed i would start cooking right after u, come clean it NOW. i say no, i dont want my food to get cold and have to put freshly cooked food in the microwave, and that i will clean it right after i finish eating, itll only take me ten minutes. sally says itll only take a minute to clean, ur food wont get cold. i say yes it will, food gets cold really fast. she growls under her breath and snaps saying that fine she will just clean it then. but once she throws the pan into the sink, she says to other roommate Becca that im making her so angry she doesnt want to do this angry, tells Becca to come to her room so they can smoke to calm down. \n\nafter she leaves... yes, my food had gone cold from a minute of arguing. anyway, i finish eating ten minutes later, shes still in her room. i clean the pan as agreed. she doesnt come out for another twenty minutes. now, a few days later, Sally is acting extremely cold to me, ignoring me completely. \n\ni dont think im TA because we agreed on 6pm, i have a right to eat first, i dont have to rush to her command. its MY pan technically, if she really needs it all of the time then she should buy her own big pan, or just suck it up and wash it.\n\nbut im wondering if i might be TA because she was \"in a rush\" to cook (which doesnt make sense because she smoked for like half an hour) and was extremely stressed from school. it wouldve only taken me a minute to clean it and maybe i was being mean to say no and prioritize eating. we did agree that she would cook right after me. \n\nso, AITA? (also idk how to handle the tension in the apartment now lol)",
