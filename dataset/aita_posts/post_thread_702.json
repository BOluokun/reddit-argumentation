  "post content": "My wife (27F) and I (30M) have been married for 3 years, together for 4. She recently started an internship for the next two months on the other side of our large metropolitan area that takes 1 hour to get to via mass transit (at worst 1:15 and Google says at best 40). I usually take the bus to work, which takes me about 15-30 minutes. We have a car, but she doesn\u2019t drive yet. The internship leads to a potentially lucrative career for her as well as she progresses up the ranks in a few years (200K+).\n\nFor the first two days this week, I drove her to her internship. This took away about an hour+ of my sleep (30 min drop off, 30 min to work, 10 min walk), and cost us $15 in parking (she also had to commute back via mass transit given I\u2019m at work). I am a very poor sleeper in terms of times / hours (average probably 4-6 a night so every hour matters in my opinion). I admit this is my fault as I stay up too late (reading, gaming, random chores, tv) and I do not have a great sleep schedule. I also do reasonably well at my job, making around $250K+ (context later). So instead of waking up at 730, I had to wake up at 630 to take her. And even that one hour less of sleep made me feel awful during the day and I couldn\u2019t concentrate (and my job involves me thinking all day). I felt it affect my performance.\n\nI initially suggested she just take mass transit to work, and just leave earlier because I need my sleep. She countered with just take me to the main station hub, which is just 5 min away (her walking would take 15). I said that still disrupts my sleep and doesn\u2019t really solve the issue - I want my sleep to be productive at my job.\n\nThis is where the emotional blackmail started which included\n-crying\n-\u201cI can\u2019t believe my own husband won\u2019t do this for me\u201d\n-\u201cWhy are you even my husband then\u201d\n-threatening \u201cI\u2019ll do what I want\u201d when I try to find a solution\n-cold shouldering / ignoring now\n-\u201cmy own husband\u201d\n\nKeep in mind, I\u2019m trying to be reasonable / rationale and not get emotional, but I do say she is emotionally blackmailing me. I probably got somewhat emotional / loud in the argument as well - \u201cmy one hour is worth less than $25 to you\u201d.\n\nMy ultimate solution was why don\u2019t we just get an uber? It would cost $20-$25, allow both to sleep more, she could leave as she wanted, and it\u2019s safer (mass transit can be sketchy here) and quicker. At most it\u2019s for two months as she will hopefully start driving soon and we can afford it. However, she wants to save $$$ (which I sincerely appreciate cause we are single income right now) but I\u2019d rather be able to think straight and have her have a safe, quick commute.\n\nOr, should I just suck it up given it\u2019s only two months and fix my sleep schedule overnight (which has been messed up now for 3+ years). I really do value every hour (I have massive bags under eyes).\n\nTLDR: AITA? wife and I fight over morning commute. Emotional abuse / blackmail / manipulation - is it there? What is the solution? We are both stubborn.",
