  "post content": "Throwaway account and please don\u2019t repost anywhere else. \n\nI (24f) was with my ex fianc\u00e9 N (27) since I was 13 and he was 15. He was my first love, my first everything. We got engaged when I was 20 and about 6 months after we found out we were expecting. Unfortunately I miscarried a couple days later. That was the worst moment of our lives. \n\nWe always dreamed about starting a family early so this was a major blow to us individually and to our relationship. I fell into deep depression and I admit I was wrong for only caring for the lost i felt and not my partner\u2019s. We argued a lot, he partially blamed me and I accused him of not knowing how it felt to lose a life you were growing inside you. \n\nWe were hurting each other and decided to separate for a while, that while turned into a year. We still kept in contact, I went to therapy and worked on healing myself, he even came to a few sessions with me. \n\nWe decided to get back together shortly after my 23rd birthday. However the relationship wasn\u2019t the same. He was somewhat withdrawn from me and I thought it was because he still blamed me. I was sick overthinking and worrying. It got to the point where i was going backwards in my process so i decided to snoop through his phone. I found out during the year we separated he had been confiding in my sister (27) and it turned to something intimate. He cut it off when we got back together but the damage was done. She was pregnant. \n\nTurns out my parents knew about this and some of our friends. I kicked him out and cut off everybody who knew. Well a couple weeks ago I got an invite to the wedding. Something snapped inside of me, I got drunk and I took a cab to my parents house where they were throwing a party for them. Most of my family was there, I basically showed up and gave a whole fuck you speech to everybody. My sister ran upstairs in tears and my parents called me an a hole for ruining the prospect of their wedding. I said good because nobody apologized to me, everybody just kept saying we were separated, things happen people fall in love, i should be happy for them, the heart wants what i wants. The worst part is my sister told me maybe my baby died for a reason so she could get her happy ending. \n\nI\u2019m regretting getting drunk now because i\u2019m not a confrontation person but i was so upset. Aita ?\n\nHi everybody, thanks for all the support and encouraging words so far. I know this update is coming so soon but i\u2019ll like to tell you guys a joke. My sister called from an unknown number a couple minutes after i posted this lol (I\u2019ve blocked everyone). She asked well more demanded that I return the ring fianc\u00e9 bought since it would be disrespectful to keep anything for him knowing they\u2019re starting a family. She said how immature of me for basically not sucking it up and being happy for her. She even intended to make me her MoH. I apologized to her for ruining her party and told her I\u2019d mail the ring but as for me and her, we\u2019re done and to tell my parents the same. I\u2019m here balling my eyes out waiting on my therapist to finish with another patient so i don\u2019t turn to a bottle again and go off again.",

Not because he loved her or because \"the heart wants what it wants\". If that was the case he wouldn't have come back to you.\n\nHe will feel trapped and resentful and their marriage won't last. She will ALWAYS know that he loves you no matter how much she tries to convince herself otherwise. She will also know how people view her. No matter how much they console her or say the right thing to her face, she KNOWS deep inside that what she did was disgusting and that she'd be judging harshly if it was someone else. She will always feel insecure and wonder if maybe he'll start confiding in you, or even someone else, when things get bad. He, while stuck with this woman who he didn't even want to continue a relationship with before being forced to because of the pregnancy, will have to watch you pick yourself up, which you WILL, and move on and find happiness and it will KILL him.\n\nI'm so sorry that all of these people betrayed on so many different levels in an attempt to create immediate and temporary peace and the illusion of perfection, that \"everything is fine, nothing to see here!\" and somehow act as though it is YOU who is irrational. Anyone with 5 brain cells can see the truth. Trust that. Everyone can see what is happening even if they don't say anything. Makes them shit for not having your back but just know, they do know that they'd react the same way you are and that what your sister and ex did is absolutely gross. Not to mention your family totally disregarding your feelings. Time will go on. You WILL feel better. You will come out stronger and in a much better place.
