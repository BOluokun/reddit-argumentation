  "post content": "For the past few months I (17m) haven\u2019t had a good relationship with my mom or stepdad. I\u2019m angry at them because 2 years ago when my dad passed away he left me inheritance that I\u2019m supposed to get on my 18th bday. I\u2019m also getting survivors benefits that my mom uses for me when I need things so is not like she used this inheritance  for me. \n\nThey bought a house that we moved into. It was weird for me because we always lived in a 3 bedroom apartment. My stepdad is a substitute teacher and my mom\u2019s a part time reception.  They never even had enough to go for a vacation or something but all of a sudden they had for a large house out of nowhere. Mg mom looked guilty about it until she finally admitted they used some of what my dad left me to buy the house. I lost my shit. \n\nThey tried to justify that it was for me too and I asked them does that mean they\u2019re moving out when I\u2019m 18 an the house is gone be in my name? And they\u2019re like no. That\u2019s what I thought. Supposedly the house was for my but max time I would\u2019ve lived there was a few months. \n\nThere\u2019s still some money left if I went to a cheap college but still can\u2019t believe they used my money for something on themselves. That amount could\u2019ve helped me get my own damm house. Also think is funny since my stepdad didn\u2019t like my dad because since I was spending more time with him that meant my mom had to pay a little in child support. \n\nBut he doesn\u2019t care using the money he left for me. Sorry if this a bit of a rant but where I\u2019m asking it I was an asshole was last Saturday his family all came to stay at the house. They stayed Friday night so it was nxt morning when I\u2019m getting ready to go to work. I made myself eggs in a hurry before I left my stepdad asked how come there wasn\u2019t more for his family. And told him it\u2019s because I\u2019m already leaving for work there wasn\u2019t gonna be time to make something for everyone. He acted like it\u2019s not a big deal if I\u2019m a little late since its rare they have people over at the house. \n\nWe got back in forth because I\u2019m not going to stop to make breakfast whne he can do it himself. Then he pulled that don\u2019t talk to me like that in my house. Btw there\u2019s no door in the kitchen and that leads right to the living room so they could hear all this. I said loudly actually it\u2019s *my* house since you paid for it with my money and don\u2019t forget they stole from me. \n\nMy mom is expecting me to apologize for embarrassing him in front of his whole family because after I left they all had shit to say about it. They already went home by the time I got home but you could feel the tension. He straight up ignored me that\u2019s how bad it was. I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything for me to apologize for so that\u2019s where she thinks I\u2019m not being a good son and kind of an a-hole. Wanna know if others feel the same.",

The advice about the statute of limitations starting at age 18 is the only solid piece of advice in the above post. \n2. Mom should have received SS funds for both OP and herself in equal amounts up until he turned 16. She is then expected to get a full time job. She was and remains legally liable to support him, not visa-versa. After age 16, she receives the funds on behalf of the OP. She can use the entirety if needed for \\*his\\* support, not hers, certainly not hubby\u2019s. My youngest was 13 when her father (63) died (we were married and together). After age 16, I banked 25% for her personal allowance use, used the balance for her separate expenses such as music lessons, uncovered personal therapy (I paid half as parent), special travel, music subscriptions etc. I paid all the ordinary expenses. SS funds are not meant for step-anythings. Unless OP graduates high school at 18, funds continue to 19, graduation, whichever comes later. However, at 18, the funds legally belong to the OP. I brought my youngest to the bank shortly after her bd, helped her open a checking and savings account. I charged no rent or other basics bc she didn\u2019t graduate until age 19, in June 2020. I worked with her on setting up her own appointments, getting own insurance, not even taking her as a dependent on my taxes. Adulting 101. I also handed over copies of all trust, life insurance, and SS information for her own file cabinet when she turned 18 and had her both open a personal bank box as well as speak with an experienced estate attorney without my being there.\n3. Parent owes a fiduciary duty to minor OP, irrespective of state.\n4. As a probate/estate planning/conservatorship/guardianship attorney, I was court appointed for a teen whose father and stepmother ripped him off. It involved a wrongful death payment for the mother he watched die in front of him at age nine. I seized their huge double cab 4WD truck, their beachfront home, their tax returns, the car they bought the stepdaughter, and the business assets he obtained through the use of his son\u2019s funds. Not exactly the work of a \u201cbank teller.\u201d\n5. The OP should try to find out if the funds were his through a probate or by way of life insurance proceeds. He needs an advocate in his corner. If there is a trustworthy family member or friend of Dad\u2019s, they may be able to help find an experienced litigator within the overall probate field. Also, there are probably records relating to his inheritance at home. Morally, thieves have no right to privacy from their victim  but OP DO NOT risk your safety to get them. If they are readily available, take private photos or make copies and send to someone outside of home keep them safe, keep no copies at home or on your phone. \n6. To the OP: no, you are NTA. Both your mother and step are TAs. \n7. FINALLY: Don\u2019t confront them on this anymore for your own personal safety. Do \\*not\\* threaten prosecution. See also if there is an adult who could take you immediately in an emergency. A CPS/criminal complaint is not the starting place. And no, I\u2019m not hustling for a job here. I\u2019m retired, no longer a licensed attorney and am \\*not\\* looking for work. I simply spent decades actively protecting vulnerable elders, minors and individuals with disabilities from greedy people, most of whom were family members.\n\nBest of luck, OP.",

Even IF you were 10 and had 8 years left to live in that house, they had no right to spend your inheritance on a house. That money was for YOUR future not theirs. Expecting your 17yo to cook breakfast for the family when they are late for work\u2026when you are completely free to do so yourself is incredibly selfish (sensing a pattern here). Tbh I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong by expressing it\u2019s your house. Was it petty? Yes. But justifiably so. It doesn\u2019t even sound like you were trying to humiliate him. You simply stated the truth. He wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed if there wasn\u2019t merit to what you said.\n\nAlso to echo everyone else, contact a lawyer!\n\nAlso might be a good idea to text him or your mom about this at some point just to have a paper trail documenting them affirming they used your inheritance to buy a house for themselves. Idk if that will be usable evidence going forward but nice to have in your back pocket. (Ex. \u201cMom said to apologize to you for embarrassing you in front of XYZ. I\u2019m texting because I\u2019m still upset and You probably are too. I wasn\u2019t trying to embarrass you, Ive just been holding in a lot of anger about my inheritance and just blew up. I\u2019m trying to plan for college and it really still bothers me that even though my dad left me the money for my future, you and mom spent part of my inheritance on this house that feels more for your futures than mine.\u201d etc etc) that way he responds (thinking this text is a just a shitty apology) and argues that they used the money \u201cfor your benefit\u201d  you will have some preliminary evidence that they misused your inheritance \n*again not sure if this would truly be helpful w/ lawyer but can\u2019t hurt to have",
