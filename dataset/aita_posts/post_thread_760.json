  "post content": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI (27F) have a sister (35F) who likes to write \"books\" (badly written romance and fanfics). She keeps all her files on a fancy macbook (she never uses USBs or anything for some reason) that she bought with some money I loaned her, and she apparently is still unable to pay me back. The problem with this is\n\n1. it's been 2 entire fucking years\n2. she actually has plenty of money.\n\nWhenever I bring this up to her, she just gives me some bullshit excuse. None of them make any sense whatsoever. She always tells me either that she's close to being able to pay me back, or that something has happened to the money. Every. Single. Fucking. Time.\n\nOne day, she decided to fight me on it. She came to stay with me for a while because her flatmate kicked her out (again), and a few days into that, I asked if she was any closer to finally paying me back.\n\nShe started making her usual excuses, but I decided I'd had enough and pointed out how ridiculous this was. She started yelling and screaming at me, telling me she was trying her hardest and that she was \"doing her best\" and \"how dare \\[I\\] say that about her.\"\n\nShe backed me into a corner near the desk she'd been using. I put my hand on it to keep my balance and hopefully remain standing (she was trying to push me over onto the floor, even though I was already in the fucking corner. How smart), and I accidentally pushed her laptop in a way that made it hit a glass of water close to it. The glass fell over and water went all over it.\n\nShe then started screaming that I had destroyed her laptop and stormed out. It's been a couple of days since then, I haven't heard from her and all her stuff is still here, including the macbook. It's actually okay (it was closed and I guess that saved it somehow?) and I've decided to just keep it if she doesn't come back. i still feel kind of bad for making her panic about it though, she loves this laptop and her stories.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: So some people have been telling me to back up her stories. I feel like it's been overlooked that she has a password. I can't access anything on the computer. \n\nAs for keeping it, I meant keeping it here until she comes back to get it. I'll give her some time before I repossess it entirely, I guess I should've been clearer about that lol.\n\nOn another note, some of you have told me that I suck for disliking my sister. I get it, we're family, and even if we weren't, we're adults. Neither of us should really be as petty as this.\n\nI've tried reaching out now, I've left a message saying that the laptop is okay and that I haven't done anything with it (yet, she has a few weeks to get it). She hasn't responded and she hasn't come back yet. We'll see what happens later I guess.",

My personal policy is don\u2019t borrow money from someone if you know you can\u2019t pay it back, but I think she\u2019s lying. She also sucks for trying to back you into a corner and attempting to push you onto the ground. You suck for not telling her that the laptop is actually okay since it\u2019s probably causing her a lot of anxiety and worry since she clearly loves the stuff on it. You also suck for the way you\u2019re talking about something your sister clearly loves. I cannot stand when people talk shit about other people\u2019s interests if it\u2019s not hurting anyone. \n\nI\u2019d say to tell her the laptop is okay, but unless she pays you the money, she will not be getting it back.",

Usually it's a good idea to only loan money when you're okay with never seeing it again. Loaning money to family just makes things even more complicated. I think you become an AH when you escalate things with your sister to the point of a physical altercation. From the way you write the event, it seems like your sister starts screaming at you after you ask about the money as if that was the only provocation, which I doubt. Based on the way you write about your sister, I think you were probably antagonizing her to some degree. You've brought up the money time and time again, but after a certain point you need to cut your losses, and maybe even ties with your sister, but starting a fight is not the answer. Escalating things to the point where they get physical is what makes you an AH. Obviously she's an AH for not paying you back, for pushing you, and just in general being a brat. ESH, your sister more than you. You both are too old to be acting like this.",
