  "post content": "So I was leaving a restaurant and my wife kid (3) year old lets call her Rachel \n\nSo mil starts saying my daughter is ugly I get pissed and tell her to shut up well she then starts saying my car sucks ass and I should get a more exotic car I tell her if she wants me to get a better car she can pay for it herself and until then she must shut the fuck up. My wife and I were on the same page until her mil tried to unbuckle my daughter I pull over and I was gonna kick her right then but didn't want to make a scene I cuss mil out and my wife starts yelling at me I tell her to stay out of this and stay in her lane and she is pissed and didn't talk after that.\n\nWell mil tests me again and says that I need to get rid of Rachel i m done so I again pull over at a local McDonalds and tell her to gtfo of my car she laughs and refuses I get out of my car then and open her side she then gets out my wife cusses me out saying I can't leave her mother there I tell my wife to get out also and she does also I tell her if she condones this behavior she's a pos and I should divorce her. \n\nI'm getting hella lot of emails and calls and voicemails saying I'm a dick my step daughter even called me and cussed me out.\n\nAITA here?",
