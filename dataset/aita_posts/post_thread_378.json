  "post content": "I (22f) am getting married soon. Since my fianc\u00e9 and I are childfree and because we plan to have alcohol at our wedding, we decided to have a childfree wedding with the age cutoff at 21. \n\nThis requirement so far has gone over well with most of our invitees (most of our invitees don\u2019t even have kids anyway so it doesn\u2019t make a difference for them). \n\nI do have one friend \u201cMel\u201d (20f) that I had to exclude from the wedding. After realizing that pretty much everyone else from the same social circle had been invited except her, she confronted me and demanded to know why she wasn\u2019t invited. \n\nI tried to explain that it wasn\u2019t personal and that I just didn\u2019t want to have to worry about underage drinking going on under my nose on my wedding day. \n\nBut Mel kept accusing me of being a bad friend. She argued that since we had drank together before it shouldn\u2019t be such a big deal, but I told her that it was different since we were both underage at the time (I was 20 and she was 18-19ish when we started drinking together). Now as an adult, I feel like I have a responsibility to prevent underage drinking, and as the bride, I feel like I have the right to have a childfree wedding.\n\nMel is unconvinced and keeps talking bad about me behind my back to our mutual friends and making snarky comments about me feeling superior. I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t just relax and let me have my wedding day the way I like. So Reddit, aita?",
