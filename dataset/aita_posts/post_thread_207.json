  "post content": "A little backstory I was born paralyzed and unable to walk and I need a wheelchair to get around. I mostly use a power wheelchair and I have a spare manual wheelchair when I can't use my power chair, like when I go to my sisters house or in older buildings that are very handicapped accessible and my power chair doesnt fit. So Thanksgiving afternoon I'm having Thanksgiving at my sisters house and heading out the door and I go out to my garage where I keep my manual chair and I see my neighbors son and his friend playing in my wheelchair and being very rough with (they were both riding on it and they tipped over backwards) I was angry and yelling at them that my wheelchair wasn't a toy and that I needed it and they just laughed and continued playing with it. So several minutes go by of me trying to get them to stop playing in my wheelchair they were in their backyard that I can't get to so I try calling their parents to try and help but they don't answer so I have to go all the way around the block to get to the front of my neighbors house. When I get to the front of my neighbors house and I'm finally able to tell them the situation my neighbors say it isn't a big deal and I shouldn't be so angry but by this time it's been several minutes and I'm supposed to be at my sisters house with food and I inform my neighbors that I need my wheelchair to go to my sisters. I finally got my manual chair and I tell my neighbor I'm going to call the police next time and my neighbor said I was being a sensitive A hole but I don't think I am. Am I the Ahole?\n\nUpdate: I asked my neighbor to fix my chair and he laughed again (thankfully nothing was broken on the chair everything just needed tightened) I just wanted him to be the one to do the repairs I got them in less than 5 minutes. Also there were no scratches or anything on the chair. So after being laughed at I went back inside and called the non emergency number for police and they sent someone out, this is where it gets kinda crazy the son and his friend had both in trouble before and they were on probation and so he was taken away by the police not sure about the friend also his father was arguing with the police and then tried coming over to my house while still arguing with the police and he was threatened with arrest and also nearly pepper sprayed, the father was not arrested and calmed down a little and went back inside his house. I will update again if anything else happens. Thank you everyone for saying I am NTA.",

From what I know, wheelchairs are not inexpensive, and if they should break the wheelchair the next time, you don\u2019t know that those parents have the means to replace it.\n\nGet a lock put on your garage to be sure, but just in case there\u2019s a next time make sure that you\u2019re calling the police this time. Whatever repairs are needed for the wheelchair, it\u2019s likely going to be easier  to hold them responsible for repairs as opposed to replacing the chair.\n\nIt would be amazing if those kids could be made to pay for the repairs, as it might teach them a valuable lesson.",
