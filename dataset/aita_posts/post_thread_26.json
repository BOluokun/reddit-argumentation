  "post content": "\n\nHi. This a minor conflict that me f31 and my boyfriend m33 had this week. We've been together for 9 months. He's a pediatrician and I have a job at an elementry school. He's sweet and makes me feel happy whenever we're togetger.\n\nHe was missing me lately and been wanting me to visit and he was too busy so I only got the chance to visit yesterday.\nWe sat down in the living room in his apartment and he was about to make some coffee when the door rang 13 minutes after I arrived. He went to take a look through the hole then returned and asked me to get up and follow him to the kitchen. I asked why but he didn't say. He had me enter the kitchen and said his 2 friends who are his work colleagues (doctors) came to visit and he wanted me to sit tight for few minutes til they leave. I was confused I asked why not let me just meet them and he said no not like this and asked me to not come out the kitchen til they leave then went to welcome them.\n\n\nI sat still waiting as the time passed. They stayed for an hour and I started calling Donnie but he didn't answer me. I felt uncomfortable and couldn't wait anymore after I was ignored like that. I just took my purse and walked out the kitchen and told Donnie that I got bored of waiting for his friends to leave then said I was leaving and walked through the door immediately feeling upset.\n\nHe was stunned and so were his friends. He called me later saying what I did was disrespectful and rude. He said he asked me this one favor and I didn't do it. I replied that I left because of the treatment I recieved nomatter how much he tells me to make myself at home I was still a guest and I was made to feel like I was less than his doctor friends but he swore it wasn't like that and that he considers himself lucky to have known me but still said what I did was not cool and leaving like that and saying what I said infront of his friends was wrong of me.\n\nI'm adding more information to make few things clear.\n\nEdit1 I already met his family and other people but none of them is in the same field he's in. We also meet publicly\n\nEdit2: He claimed that they were talking about stuff I wouldn't understand and I'd feel awkward sitting there not knowing what they were talking about.\n\nEdit3: he said I should've made myself busy making dinner in the kitchen instead of waiting til his friends leave since we agreed to eat dinner together but I ruined our plans.",

He didn't want her heard or seen, and he's trying to cover by blaming her for not starting dinner. What an ass.",
