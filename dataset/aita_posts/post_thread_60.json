  "post content": "My family is on a big divide about this so I was hoping I could get an unbiased perspective. I am the youngest of four siblings, by far. I am 22F and my husband is 26M. \n\nMy siblings are 30F, 32M, 33M. Between the three of them they have a combined 14 children. They all have multiple children. None of them went to college, and they all work lower paying entry level jobs. I graduated last year (I started college in highschool) and I work as a nurse. My husband works on planes but I don\u2019t want to say what he does specifically. Our household income is about 200k, and average where we live is about 80k I think. This is all relevant. \n\nMy parents like to host big family functions for every holiday and they bring the whole family together. Ever since I was a teenage my siblings have always asked me for favors, mostly to babysit. I did it for a while when I was around 16, but quickly realized they didn\u2019t appreciate anything and there was nothing in it for me so I stopped. For the past 6 years I\u2019ve had the \u201cdon\u2019t ask me for anything\u201d stance, since my siblings are the type to ask for favors but never offer to help you need it. They always borrow money from our parents but never pay it back. \n\nMy oldest brother is getting evicted, and asked if him and his girlfriend and their four kids could stay with me and my husband. My husband and I own a 4 bed 2 bath home. I told them no because they have a habit of settling in somewhere and not paying rent and refusing to leave. They also let their four kids absolutely destroy every rental they live in, coloring on the walls, holes in the walls, etc. \n\nMy brother and his girlfriend are pissed at me, and they blew up at us at my mothers birthday party last week. They\u2019re going to have to stay at a shelter and they\u2019re saying it\u2019s my fault, but I think it\u2019s their own lack of responsibility. My other two siblings chimed in agreeing with my brother, and they think I\u2019m a sucky asshole. I think that my siblings suck and I don\u2019t want my house getting torn up by their heathens. I know that if I let them move in I\u2019d end up having the evict them, and they wouldn\u2019t pay for anything at all. \n\nI think it\u2019s not fair that they always ask me for money because I make more money than they do, and they treat my husband and I like we\u2019re some kind of upper class snobs because we worked hard and made good choices in life to be able to buy a house early. \n\nAITA for not helping my siblings? Specifically my brother I guess\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: \nI\u2019m offering to pay for everyone to get a vasectomy/ tubes tied this Christmas and giving my brother enough money to cover the red roof inn for a week. That\u2019s it. All  I\u2019m doing for anyone and they better not call me ever because I\u2019m not answering.",
