  "post content": "Hello there, I\u2019m currently typing this from my car, after my wife has told me she doesn\u2019t want me near her right now. Hoping this thread will be a wake up call to her.\n\nMy wife (F33) is a big nerd, which I normally appreciate, but she is taking things way too far today. She took today off of work, so she could be up at 4AM to play her online game at launch. I didn\u2019t wake up until about an hour ago (10:30, and she was still playing. I mentioned that I was\nHungry, hoping we could make breakfast together , which we like to do together. She instead said that I should \u201corder us something from doordash, im in the middle of a dungeon and may be a while.\u201d I didn\u2019t really wanna get takeout, because we had already discussed ordering pizza tonight for dinner, and that\u2019s a lot of take out food in one day. I calmly explained this, and she got pissed and shrieked at me that she just wanted one weekend to focus on her video game. I said that it was unfair to our family for her to isolate all weekend, and she got even more mad, telling me that I have two hands and can feed the goddamn cat. I was in tears at this point, and I did raise my voice and said that I was worried she\u2019s obsessed with this game and maybe she needs professional help. She threw her car keys at me and said that I need to get out of her face, that she\u2019s works all the time and doesn\u2019t ask for much, and I need to leave her be and get out of her face for a few hours.\n\nI am truly concerned that she has become obsessed with this online game, and I\u2019m hoping that maybe reading this thread will wake her up to it, but I might\u2019ve been the AH too.\n\nEdit: some additional info I forgot: ir isn\u2019t just today, for the last few weeks she\u2019s been hyping herself up for this. When the game got delayed, she MOVED HER VACATION time rather than just keep her previous day off and spend it with me. She\u2019s been absolutely freaking out about this game and I don\u2019t understand it and it scares me.",

      "content": "Dude, she isn\u2019t obsessed with a game. A lot of people wake up early/stay up late for the launches of games, it\u2019s not unusual. It sounds like you\u2019re just mad that she\u2019s not cooking for you and that you have to feed yourself and the cat. When you mention you like to make breakfast together, how much do you do in that?  I also call bullshit on the \u201ccalmly explained and she freaked out and went hysterical\u201d portion of this. Chances are, you whined about it and she got annoyed. And do you have kids? Because if you don\u2019t, and it\u2019s just you two and the cat, then how is playing a game for a few hours \u201cunfair\u201d? If she works all the time, and this is her way to unwind, let her. She\u2019s not hurting anyone and you are a grown adult capable of taking care and entertaining yourself. I also see that she said the dungeon might take a few hours, not 2-3 days. You didn\u2019t want this thread to \u201cwake her up\u201d, you just wanted validation from strangers online about your whining. Tl:dr, YTA",

This is one day, you're not being neglected, but you are ruining something she has been looking forward to for likely months because it's getting more attention than you for the day.\n\nSeriously, the way she's acted indicates this isn't just  about the game.

Some people get excited when tour de France comes on or when the football season is on or when a new car gets released. We get excited about pixels that we share with many other people. And yes, we hype about it for months before it comes out. It\u2019s *normal*.\n\nAnd that she used the word \u201cdungeon\u201d and that it may take a while (not something she can just pause) could very well imply she\u2019s doing it with other people. Real people. As real as you, OP. Sitting on their own chairs in front of their own computers being all excited about this new game release. Together. \n\nShe took a day off work, so she could do a thing she enjoys doing, something she has been extremely excited about, looked forward to and you made it about you. *You* were hungry, *you* wanted her attention, *you* made her hobby into a disease and made her feel like something was wrong with her. Dude. Seriously. What. The. Fuck. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to understand something to appreciate that it makes your wife happy. So long as she maintains a normal life, you still get to spend time with her etc then she gets to take her vacation time and use it on what she wants. It\u2019s no different than a woman going on a girls trip with her girlfriend during her vacation - where a bf would also not be included. Grow up. Okay? \n\nMake your own food, feed the cat. Tell her you\u2019re sorry and let her enjoy her goddamn hobby in peace if you can\u2019t be supportive.
