  "post content": " My cousin is very famous. Yes, you have heard of him, and no, I won't tell you who he is. We'll call him Terry.\n\nWhen we have family functions (mainly for holidays), Terry likes for them to be only family so he can \"be himself\" and get drunk and pass out on the couch and share Hollywood gossip with us, otherwise he feels like he is being interviewed and having everyone talk to him or want a picture and he has to \"be in promo mode.\"  He said it's because he was tired of having to meet strangers and not be able to let loose and there were some issues of these partners taking pics of him or spreading gossip.\n\nI hated this at first because I would be dating some chick and she would want to get to meet him and it's awkward to tell them they can't come to family events and they get mad that they never get to meet him (my tinder has a pic of me with Terry). But I get it so I was fine with it. Until this year.\n\nI began dating this chick in August. I couldnt bring her to Thanksgiving, fine. But when I walk in, I see another cousin, \"Danielle\", has brought her boyfriend \"Steve\" EVEN THOUGH they've been together for less than a year!!! They got together over New Years and engaged on Halloween. \n\nTerry was fine with this because he's met Steve before (old family friend) even though I've been told that no exceptions are allowed to his rule. Thanksgiving sucked because the whole time I was mad that I once again wasn't allowed to bring my gf.\n\nMy gf consoled me after and I realized that she is my soulmate. Two weeks ago, I proposed and we got engaged.\n\nXmas was at my aunt's. Im a believer in \"ask for forgiveness, not permission\" so I brought my fianc\u00e9e because she had nowhere else to go and I wanted her to meet my family. We walk into the house and all hell breaks loose. \n\nEveryone was asking who she was and scolding me about the rules, and Terry flipped out. He was already buzzed (and looked 20 pounds heavier than he usually presents himself) and started yelling at me for doing this to him. He didn't seem excited at all about my engagement or willing to introduce himself to her.\n\nOur grandma was telling Terry to get over it and asking to see the ring and saying she wish she had gotten my fianc\u00e9 a gift, so grandma was on my side. But Terry was still arguing with me and said I shouldn't be allowed at any more events, and he ended up calling an Uber Black and leaving before we even ate. \n\nTo top it all off, my uncle (who has never even liked Terry) got upset because apparently Terry was his Secret Santa so he didn't get a gift, so my uncle started blaming me for ruining Christmas.\n\nI get they are mad but it was clear there was an exception for fianc\u00e9es and I'm embarrassed that my family was so rude to her when I just didn't want her to be alone on Christmas.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

          "content": "I was definitely going to point this out. I imagine it gets hard to convince people you have a super famous relative without proving it by bringing them face to face. Photos can be manipulated. So, if he hooks women who are only interested in him because of said famous person, keeping them for any length of time is probably difficult once they realize they will never meet that famous person. Especially because they didn\u2019t get introduced at Thanksgiving. I imagine he also makes it clear on his Tinder that he\u2019s related to this person on his fucking profile, probably listed in the photo caption and his info. Maybe him getting engaged was less because she\u2019s his \u201csoulmate\u201d and more because she wanted to walk because she thought he was lying about shit, so he saw the other engaged couple, and jumped at that excuse to get them face to face, thereby keeping her on the hook. The famous person has every fucking right to be upset. That\u2019s without even taking the TMZ story his ex sold into account. Until OP stops using his cousin for whatever he clout he fucking can, then OP can fucking come to holidays alone. You don\u2019t blatantly use your family like that. It\u2019s like a dude stealing a baby niece or nephew, or a puppy for a day solely to hit on or pick up women. It\u2019s pathetic and sleazy all at the same time. Also, he shouldn\u2019t be surprised when all the women he pulled in strictly because he\u2019s related to a celebrity leave him for the next best thing. They obviously aren\u2019t doing it for him.",

Even if they made an exception for Steve (who at Thanksgiving was fiance, not BF, per your timeline) you gave a clear reason why...he was already an old family friend and had met Terry before. Your fiance does not meet that criteria but you brought her anyway.\n\n2. Your fiance may not be a \"fangirl\" in your opinion, but she's asked for pics with Terry before. According to you, you know Terry doesn't want to deal with that at family functions.\n\n3. Your family didn't even know you were engaged and you put them on the spot. And considering this isn't your first engagement and you knew they would be skeptical/less than pleased, you had to have known it wouldn't go over well.\n\n4. By your own admission you use a pic of you with Terry to get matches on Tinder. That's exactly the kind of stuff he doesn't want happening. You're using him solely for your own benefit and I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't want to have further contact with you after this stunt.\n\nYou could've avoided all the drama and kept your fiance from being alone at Christmas simply by celebrating on your own. But you instead chose to do the one thing you knew was off the table and were the one that put your fiance in that awkward spot. And honestly, it kind of sounds like you were doing it as a payback \"one up\" on your cousin for Thanksgiving.\n\nETA: considering it was one of your previous fiancees who sold info on Terry/was the cause of the rule, you're an even bigger AH than previously thought...both for buying dates with your connection to him, and for bringing your uninvited new fiance to the party.
