  "post content": "Throwaway bc she knows my reddit.\n\nSo, here's the deal. My (28M) girlfriend (27F) of two years and I planned a two-week vacation to Italy. I paid for the flights, hotels\u2014everything, because I make more than she does, and I wanted it to be a stress-free trip for both of us. Everything was great until the last day when she tells me she wants to stay longer to \"find herself\" and think about our relationship without me. She didn't discuss this with me beforehand, and it completely blindsided me.\n\nI was hurt and told her that if she feels she needs time alone, then she should also be independent financially during this extension of her trip. I said I wouldn\u2019t be paying for her new return ticket whenever she decides to come back. Now, she's upset, calling me unsupportive and selfish, and some of our friends are saying I'm being an a-hole because I left her stranded in a foreign country without financial help.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for refusing to pay for her new plane ticket home after she chose to extend her trip without any heads-up?\n\n\n\nUpdate: Thank you to all the people who responded, especially the early ones who gave some outside verification of me probably not being the asshole. I don't feel comfortable saying I'm completely blameless here because you're only getting one side of the story and I need to take responsibility for my part in this whole thing such as it is. But I guess I never realized how good my gf was at making me feel like unreasonable shit was normal and rational and that I was the crazy one. \n\nSo here's the update. We're both back in America now and she's packing her shit to go stay with her family for a bit until she can find a new place. Soon after I posted, it was time to go to the airport, so I did...without her. I'm one of those people who arrives really early because I never think I'll get to the gate in time because everything that could go wrong probably would go wrong (it never does but, especially with how I was feeling my luck was going, I didn't want to push it). \n\nI was there for about an hour by myself mulling things over and talking to my mom. I looked at a couple responses to this post but I didn't trust that I wouldn't lose it if I started responding and I definitely didn't want to burst into tears while I was in the airport. \n\nAs I was talking to my mom, my gf showed up. I guess she thought I was bluffing but had a rude awakening when the hotel staff kicked her out of the room because I'd only paid through that day. I took no small amount of satisfaction in this, ngl. She'd been so concerned about the plane ticket that she didn't even stop to think about where she was going to stay...\n\nAs many of you guessed, she met someone while we were in Italy. She was quick to tell me that it was just a physical attraction and that they hadn't done anything, but she had his @ and was wanting to see if it'd go anywhere. I guess that's what I get for not feeling well and wanting to stay in one night while she went out to explore...\n\nObviously, I told her things were over between us. Even though she tried to make it sound like nothing had happened, the fact was a. I couldn't feel like I could trust her when she said that and b. I don't really want to be with someone who feels like it's okay to still \"keep her options open\" when she's been in a monogamous relationship for the past 2 years. \n\nThe flight home was awkward as fuck and she tried really hard to give another pitch for why we should stay together on the drive home from the airport. I think, as we got closer to home, reality started setting in and she realized she'd just thrown a lot away. \n\nSo yeah. I'm jetlagged and physically and emotionally exhausted. I'm just kind of numb at this point. \n\nFinally, I didn't see all the comments (as there are 2.5k at the time of this update) but, to the few that were downvoted into oblivion who said this was fake because I hadn't updated in several hours...fuck you. I was looking for reasonable dissenting opinions that might have helped me make sense of this situation and you're accusing me of making this up for random internet points?? Believe it or not, my priority was not to tell a bunch of strangers on the internet how my world was falling apart around me. I know it's easy to think that these people aren't real and their struggles are meaningless because screens divide us but, ironically, you're the assholes. ",

That's reasonable and fair.\n\n>Now, she's upset, calling me unsupportive and selfish, and some of our friends are saying I'm being an a-hole because I left her stranded in a foreign country without financial help.\n\nYou *have* been supportive and unselfish. You didn't complain or become difficult. You respected her decision to stay and 'find herself.' Supportive does not necessarily mean you have to pay for her choices. \n\nAnd no, you didn't strand her in a foreign country without financial help. It was *her* decision to stay behind. All you did was respect her decision. However, it was not your obligation to fund her decision. \n\nShe's a grown woman, which means she's responsible for her choices *and* her financial independence. You invited her on a couple's trip. Well, the couple's trip is over. She decided to stay on her own? That's no longer part of the deal. She has every right to stay behind, she also has the right to pay for that out of her own pocket. \n\nHas she been this manipulative before? Red flag.",

The last day she tells you that she doesn't want to use the ticket tomorrow that you already paid for, so she can find herself and think about the relationship. What world would you finance her \"thinking about your relationship.\" That is what is tremendously selfish here. Not that this would excuse her inappropriate timing to \"think about your relationship\" but along with dropping this on you 1 day before your departure, she should have been the one saying she'd refund the ticket she is wasting that you already paid for and pay her own way.\n\nTo me this sounds like she wants some Italian dick but that is just an assumption at this point.\n\nI hope along with not paying for her new ticket you also aren't paying for her accommodations or any other expenses.\n\nIf you are stateside and she is still in Italy I hope YOU take this time to think about the relationship.\n\nYou are not selfish, she is the one not only being selfish, but she is taking advantage of your support and in turn is leaving you thinking what? She is going to stay, potentially cheat, and think about dumping you, while expecting you to pay?\n\nLastly, the friends are delusional. YOU didn't leave her \"stranded in a foreign country without financial help,\" she chose to stay past the accepted departure date, why would the assumption be you pay for everything? Is she not an adult? If she can make a personal decision to waste your money and disrespect you, while implying she is going to \"think about the relationship\" she should have had a plan to pay for it like a fucking adult does.\n\nEdit: Went to the bathroom and thought of a great response, granted this in the moment probably wouldn't have thought of this myself but anyway. I'm imagining if a woman said this to me and it was to \"think about the relationship\" and I would have said, alright, I am cancelling your return ticket, you can stay stay or do whatever you need to, there is no relationship to think about though because we are over.\"",
