  "post content": "\nMy husband (31) was in the hospital for a surgery that involved anesthesia. His mom came to wait with me there but didn't speak to me because we have been having some minor disagreements. She offered me coffee but I declined politely. \n\nHours after the surgery, we were told only one person goes into the room for the day since he was still under anesthesia. From what I understand he woke up calling for his mom, the nurse asked for his mom to go in and she did. I was irritated and felt like all this waiting and stressing out got ignored. The nurse told me that he was still not fully awake and was repeatedly calling for his mom spontaneously, she was basically hinting that I shouldn't get worked up over a natural reaction from my husband but I couldn't help feel irked. I wanted to go home so I left 10 minutes later. His mom called saying she got out the room after I left so I could get time with him but instead I couldn't wait and went home. She said this was not okay and I flew off the handle for no reason, I said that her son acted like I wasn't there but she said that he can not be blamed for something he can't control and I'm just being unfair to him and putting blame on him because of a disagreement between her and I. I cut the conversation short after I sensed that she somehow blamed me for being unacknowledged and ignored. Her husband texted later saying I'm being hostile over nothing and that I should focus on my husband's health instead of acting petty but I don't think I did anything that qualifies as petty.",
