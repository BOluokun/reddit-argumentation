  "post content": "My husband and I are expecting our first child and we are both really excited. Despite the excitement, I am really struggling: episodes of depression, morning sickness, tired but crazy insomnia, and altogether just not feeling like myself. I do the best I can with it (still working 12 hour shifts in healthcare, cleaning, cooking, etc). My husband is a very supportive partner mostly BUUUTTTT I had a mood swing where He said something small that hurt my feelings causing me to cry. It usually wouldn\u2019t make me cry so I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m crying these hormones are insane\u201d and my husband stated \u201cpregnancy hormones aren\u2019t real, and pregnant women use them as an excuse to act crazy\u201d. I have explained it to him, sent articles to him, and tried to have honest conversations about how I\u2019m feeling with him but he has made it clear this is an opinion he stands by. We have an appointment today and I want to ask my doctor to explain it to him hoping that hearing it from a male obgyn might give him some clarity. However, I don\u2019t want to make him upset or cause more problems (we are military so it could open up some problems for him\u2026. IYKYK). So will I be the ass hole?",

How are pregnancy hormones \"not real.\" Pregnancy is 90% hormones, 10% fetus if you ask me. The test is literally testing hormones in your pee. The idea that your body *isn't* flooded with absurd levels of hormones which are scientifically proven to affect mood and behavior during pregnancy is asinine. You would not be TA for having the doctor explain this, though I doubt it will do much good if he truly believes what he said.\n\nNow here comes the part that will probably get me downvoted.\n\nHaving recently been pregnant, I have seen a lot of women blaming \"pregnancy hornones\" for being outright abusive to their spouses. Think alone the lines of \"Just cussed out my husband for not running the dishwasher over night and made him cry. Hahaha! Anyone else? #pregnancyhomeones\"\n\nThis is not good. I don't think anyone should say that hormones make it ok to treat people shit, and i hope he actually means he's observed this kind of behavior before and he's just not good at describing what he saw.\n\nThe big issue I see is you were not teating him like shit. assuming he's referring to that \"abuse is ok because I'm pregnant\" attitude, he has conflated it with expected emotional roller coaster. He invalidated your experience, called you crazy, and was all around a jerk. He owes you an apology.",
