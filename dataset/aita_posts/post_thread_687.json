  "post content": "Edit: Okay I reread through what everyone is saying, and you guys are right. If this would've happened to me I would want someone to help me, no matter if they're garbage people. So when I get off of work I'm going to head straight to the police department. I'm not going to go through the nasty neighbors.\n\n\n\n\nI'm new to Reddit but I'm going to make this post as very short as possible.\n\nMy neighbor and their children are horrible people. They listen to music until 4 in the morning, they start fights with everyone and their kids play baseball in the middle of the street( we have a baseball field 2 blocks away) when we tell them to play in the field they always say \" ok boomer\" \" shut up little b**ch\" like that supposed to hurt my feelings or something. You tell their parents and they do nothing about it.  This is just the short version of what they do to everyone and the police don't do anything about it.\n\n\nAnyways long story short their house got robbed last night ( luckily they weren't home) and my camera ( I put them up in case the kids broke anything from playing baseball and their parent will pay for it) caught everything. The police were knocking on everyone's door ( to see what happen) and we pretend like we weren't home lol. Once they left I replay what happen and low and behold I caught 3 men breaking into their house. I'm debating on whether or not to say anything because I can't stand these people at all.\n\nSo Reddit WIBTA?\n\nTLDR: neighbors and their kids suck/terrible human beings, their house gets robbed, my cameras caught it all, wibta for not taking it to the police?",
