  "post content": "So, first things first, I (F17) do *not* know how to play the piano. Never took a lesson in my life. My father was a musician, so I have plenty of musical instruments in my house. They were mostly taking dust after he died ten years ago, so I started playing them. I have a good ear and I'm a quick learner, but I mostly focused myself on the clarinet and the guitar. I did learn to play a few songs on the piano, though. Not very complicated ones, but they are nice to hear and I'm quite good playing them. But I learned through piano tutorials, I have no technique, I just learned what keys I had to press and tried to do it over and over again until I could. I guess, though, if you happen to enter my house while I'm in the piano room playing, I can pass momentarily for someone who knows how to play the piano, and that's what happened to my aunt and uncle.\n\nThey have 2 children and a buttload of money, they make three times what my family made when I was growing up. My cousin (F9) wants to learn how to play the piano, and has been asking multiple times for lessons. But my lovely aunt and uncle, who own a last-generation gaming system, every possible gaming console the kids are not even allowed to play with, a two-storey villa, a house on the sea, apparently don't have the money to pay for her expensive lessons.\n\nHowever, yesterday they came to visit and I was playing the piano when they arrived so I didn't hear them. The barged in the piano room and started saying that they didn't know I could play the piano and that I was extremely selfish for not offering to teach my cousin since I knew how much she wanted to learn and that they don't have the means to afford lessons. I politely explained that I do not, in fact, know how to play the piano. They called me a liar. I calmly explained that I am in no way qualified to give lessons since I'd need lessons myself. They attacked me, saying that I had obviously already taken lessons and I was refusing only because they couldn't pay me. I explained how it is I can play some songs on the piano, and assured them that if I knew how to play it I'd gladly teach my cousin for free. They insisted I should at least teach her the few songs I know how to play so that she could see if she still liked it and at this point I had enough and here's where I might be TA, I told them I didn't know how to play the piano but if she wanted to learn that much they could stop be some cheap a\\*\\*holes and pretending they don't have the money when they spend thousands on things they enjoy and never a cent for their children. They left and aren't talking to my whole family until I apologize and my family says I have to but I don't want to. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all the answers and awards! I'm reading everything! ",

The school offered piano lessons to students where you could leave during class to go to them. They were group lessons and I had already been playing several years and taking private lessons so I basically just practiced my lessons material while the teacher taught the other students hot cross buns and other basic pieces. \n\nNear Christmas we had a recital. I think there were 15 of us in that piano class and about 11 of them played Jolly Old Saint Nicholas for their piece. You could see all the parents falling asleep after the 5th or so rendition. Well I got up there and introduced myself and told the audience I'd be playing \"Prelude in the romantic style\". Parents still basically being asleep did not stir. Well I sat down and hit these these huge chords and just took off with this really showy sounding piece. My mom still laughs that she saw a bunch of people around her jump awake.  \n\nHow long have you been playing cello now? I think it took me about 4 or so years before I thought I started sounding remotely good. It's a hard instrument to start but so beautiful and rewarding when you get into the really fun pieces :)",

The use of the term \"spade\" to refer to African Americans was first recorded in 1928. \n\nDoes that mean that we should ignore the racist and derogatory meaning that the word has taken on and unthinkingly use it? No, I don't think so; language changes and evolves over time and the sullying or reclaiming of words is a real thing of which we should be aware. \n\nBut to falsely state that the origins of a phrase are racist unnecessarily burdens it without context. When Oscar Wilde or Charles Dickins used it, they were doing so in an entirely different context than we experience it today.",

To borrow the old cliche, \u201cappearances can be deceiving.\u201d\n\nE.g. my aunt and then-uncle owned two houses, generally pretended to have money (which, they had a good amount, but not really considering their spending habits), but when the housing market crashed fifteen years ago, a lot of things changed.\n\nSuddenly their vacation home\u2019s mortgage was underwater by six figures, their house underwater by five figures. And then one of them lost their job, like many did. As I mentioned, they had some extravagant spending habits, and that\u2019s usually a nice way to say \u201cnot insignificant amount of debt.\u201d\n\nNow they faced a predicament: they need money/to reduce costs, but if they sold the vacation home they\u2019d still be paying a mortgage for a house that they no longer owned.\n\nAnd, let me just stick this in right here: my aunt and her ex-husband fucked themselves, hard. This was entirely a problem of their own creation, and I\u2019m *far* from defending them. The desire to live up to a higher standard of living was a significant (and, in most/all of the family\u2019s opinion, extraordinarily stupid) decision. It\u2019s not that they didn\u2019t have savings, but they planned their savings on X years of reasonable living expenses, *not* what their *actual* baseline expenses were \u2013 meaning they didn\u2019t include debt. Their (again, stupid) logic was that they put enough down on the second house that they could short-sell it at a loss and still pay off the mortgage with cash leftover \u2013 a reasonable conclusion, if you didn\u2019t think it possible for the house\u2019s value to drop 200k+ practically overnight.\n\nAnyways, back to the topic at hand \u2013 you can *appear* rich, and still struggle financially. It\u2019s nice to think you can just \u201creduce costs\u201d, but often the largest costs are not reducible, or at least not *easily* reducible. Property isn\u2019t exactly liquid, and selling a house isn\u2019t free, either \u2013 you often still need to pay for a listing agent (if you want to eke out as much money as you can), inspections, etc.\n\nMind, none of this says OP\u2019s TA or her aunt and uncle aren\u2019t \u2013 just saying that because someone *appears* to have money doesn\u2019t mean they *actually* have money. They may not be \u201ccheap\u201d, they may just not be able to realistically afford it.\n\nOf course, they may well not have the money for it *after* paying for all the shit *they want for themselves*, and that\u2019s not really \u201ccheap\u201d, that\u2019s a whole other level of narcissistic, egocentric bullshit.",

(This was back during a time of notably high unemployment, as well.)  \n\nSo my friend told her MIL, uh, no, sorry, you can't just tell randos from your church that they can move in with us.  Her MIL kept insisting that the granddaughter would be there on such and such a day, so they would need to get \"the spare room\" ready for her.  Eventually my friend got so upset that she said fine, I'll move out and your friend's granddaughter can sleep in my bed with my husband.  She had to threaten to move out of her own home and go back to her parents' house before her asshole MIL backed down.  Crazy!\n\nThen my friend's cousin-in-law, the MIL's niece, told my friend that \"we're looking forward to your help with the children at family holidays.\"  This cousin has 4 kids who act like they were raised by wolves, I met them at BFF's wedding, and CIL just informed my friend that she expected her to spend family holidays playing au pair for them.  So my BFF just never goes to the same events as this cousin and her family.\n\nI used to envy my friend that she had married into a wealthy, prestigious family, but after hearing some of her stories about how arrogant, high-handed, entitled, and demanding her snooty in-laws can be, I'm pretty happy as a single lady.",
