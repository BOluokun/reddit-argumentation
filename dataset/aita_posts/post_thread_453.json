  "post content": "I've seen a lot of narc mom validation posts on here...and I hope this isn't one.\n\nI had my twins when I was 17. I dropped out of school and moved in with a friend who was helping me support them-no rent. I got a job, earned my GED, and over the next few years I started college and got another job to pay for it. For most of their early childhood, I worked two or three jobs and took classes at a community college. Some bad events took place at my friend's house and I was forced to move into an apartment. Good news? A classmate with a boy my girls' age was looking for a place, so we became roommates and kinda co-parents. Worked great, we lived together until I was almost out of uni.\n\nStill working two jobs, I usually had night and early morning shifts and she had day shifts. Someone was always with the kids, and when she started working more we got a babysitter. At this point we were still very poor-we wore bras and underwear with holes in them because we didn't have money for new ones. She got engaged, moved in with the guy, and I was forced to find a cheaper apartment I could make on my own. I graduated, got work as a bookkeeper in a legal office, and started earning enough to confidently stay afloat and afford a reliable babysitter. We stayed in the apartment until my kids had moved out and I saved enough to move to a house in a small town (years later).\n\nNow, my girls are posting mean spirited comments on FB and complementing each other. One will post something about 'I didn't know how poor I was until I realized how big a yard can be' and the other one will say 'I always knew, other kids with competent mothers had huge backyards and we had an apartment'. Complaining about yards, being 'raised by babysitters', always moving...I got sick of it. I replied on one of their posts saying they always had a safe home with food and at least one adult around to protect them which is more than other children and they shouldn't be whining like this when they were competently cared for. My daughter deleted it, and some friends have pointed out that growing up poor still isn't easy and they were likely bullied and felt some uncertainty for the future. I've been told a good mother would let them vent now so they can come to terms with their past. While I see the reason, I also feel calling me incompetent as a mother is mean and uncalled for.\n\nEdit: I should have put this in long before now, but the \"bad events\" at my friend's place had nothing to do with my kids. My friend's parents had serious health and financial problems and could no longer house me for free. The rent they needed to supplement lost income was too high, so I had to leave so they could rent to someone else.\n\nAlso, thanks to everyone who left advice. I was expecting a lot of YTA, but I was surprised by the direction they're taking. It's opening my eyes to this, and I know I have to actually talk to my children about this. I'll try and handle it better than I have so far.\n\nAITA for replying at all?",

The competent mom comment is harsh but I think you also know it was true. You were a teen when you got pregnant. No teen mom is competent. The consequence of getting pregnant young is things like this. Mistakes were made, the kids did pay for them. I'm not trying to be too harsh with you, you did your best, but being a teen mom had it's ramifications even beyond being poor. I can understand feeling neglected because much of your time growing up was spent with a sitter.",

And if their FB is full of randos like most people's are, then it's especially inappropriate.\n\nI don't think you can control how they feel overall about their childhood regardless of your attempts to provide. I apologise for how that might make you feel, but you have no control over that and they will probably never truly understand the hardships you went through to bring them up as best you could under the circumstances. That's not unusual and I don't blame them if they found it lacking, lots of people do due to various circumstances. People can feel however they want and discuss it with whoever they want. The problem is the scattershot FB venting and the lack of consideration for your feelings when it's broadcast to a bunch of whoever.\n\nThe yard isn't the problem and the meme isn't the problem either. Relatable memes are a big part of FB. If it was just the yard thing without the personal commentary then there's not a whole lot to be upset about, memes are relatable for a reason.

(OP says they're in their 20's) \n\nIf they really cared about not being poor then they could have gotten jobs as soon as they were able to to help contribute to the household, or even to buy the luxuries they wanted. (Unless OP wanted them to focus just on school, my parents were like that and refused to let me get a job so I could focus on grades to get scholarships) \n\nAlso if their childhood really was that bad then they should be in therapy. Not putting their mom on blast on a sight where she can see what they're saying. \n\nMy mom was also the same age as OP when she had me too.",

Throughout the ages women from all parts of the globe have given birth in their teens and some of those mothers have been and will be competent. And I'm giving major Kudos to OP because it sounds like she simultaneously fed and clothed her kids while fighting to achieve a better life. I consider that competent. Does that make her mother of the year? For those who grew up with dead beat parents this woman probably sounds like a star.\n\nSecond, it is estimated that [43% of children](http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html) live in low-income families. Being poor doesn't make her kids special and complaining about it on FB to their tone deaf friends make them seem extremely ungrateful for the sacrifices their mother made to get them to their current lifestyle.\n\nThird, and this is a note for the OP, you've raised ungrateful kids and you're going to have to deal with it. If I were you I'd consider blocking them on FB and other SM until they get themselves together.

I understand these kids weren\u2019t rich and living in poverty does a number on people but calling a parent incompetent for not providing a house with a yard is over the top. I grew up with parents who were poor immigrants who worked themselves up to middle class only to then declare bankruptcy and we had to move our whole family to a one bedroom apartment. No yard. It wasn\u2019t that big a deal. Even as a bratty stubborn teenager I didn\u2019t think it was that big a deal.",
