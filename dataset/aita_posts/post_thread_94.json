  "post content": "The title sounds so ridiculous I cannot believe I'm writing this.\n\nMy baby turned one last week, so we planned a little party for him last weekend. We were supposed to have only one party with both sides of the family, but my sister-in-law and her husband live far away (they have not meet our baby yet, the last time we saw them was before the plague), and they postponed their visit for a week, so we had a party with my side of the family (my mom, my two siblings and their partners) last week, and another party yesterday, with my husband's side (his mom, my SiL and her husband).\n\nAs you can see, it was 2 very small gatherings. Basically, both times, we did the same thing : a meal, a cake, they gave gifts to the baby, fawned over him, took 1 billion pictures and videos, and we chatted while the baby napped for half of the party. \n\nI'm breastfeeding so I don't drink any alcohol, and my husband doesn't like alcohol much, so he stopped along with me. We didn't even think about buying alcohol for the parties (because the last time we've bought alcohol was like... 2 years ago, lol)\n\nI thought the party with my family-in-law went well and everyone was happy, until I received a text from my MiL this morning, asking me why I didn't serve alcohol, and that it was poor taste to neglect my guests. It seems my SiL is very upset because of me, because she thinks I was cheap when they came all the way to see us and bring gifts for our baby.\nTo be clear, my husband was the one who planned the second party, and he bought sodas and juices because that's what he wanted to buy, I don't know why I'm being blamed.\n\nThe thing is, not serving alcohol for a party IS rare and kinda weird here, but my family didn't say anything about it, so we just went with the same plan for the second party..\n\nAnd before anyone says anything about my husband, he called his mom and asked what the hell was going on, and said if they're not happy with our way of hosting, they don't have to come next time.\n\nI guess I'm asking if we are the a**hole because it seems extreme to not have them over again for such a small issue, we can just buy alcohol next time.\n\nEDIT : There are a lot more comments than what I thought, thank you all for your judgement for such a small issue.\n\nTo answer the most frequent questions : we're French, they were expecting wine with the meal and champagne with the cake, and it was lunch and the afternoon after that, they left around 6PM.\n\nHusband is still super mad at them, but as far as I'm concerned, the issue is solved. Next time, we'll say in advance we don't have alcohol and if they want to drink, they can bring their own bottle(s). Thank you to all of you who suggested that.",
