  "post content": "Throwaway account \n\nI (36 male) have a 16 year old daughter named Jane. Jane is a great kid and was really close to my mom until she passed away a year ago. My mother gave one piece of her jewelry to her children before she passed away. I was given her engagement ring. \n\nI have been planning a proposal to my girlfriend, Laura (30 female) for about 6 months now. Jane is from my previous relationship (her mother and I were never married). I\u2019ve been dating Laura for about 5 years. \n\nI told Jane I was going to propose. She was happy about it and asked to see the ring. I told her I\u2019d be using my mothers ring and Jane looked upset so I asked her what was wrong. She said she had assumed the ring would be hers since she is my daughter. I explained the ring was given to me and there are other heirlooms (small items like rosary beads) she can have. \n\nFor clarification I do have the money to buy a ring but the sentimental value of this ring is why I wanted to use it. Laura also helped us take care of our mom while she was sick and they were close. \n\nI proposed to Laura with the ring and she said yes. After this happened Jane cried to her uncle (my brother) about it and he understands both points. His wife thinks I\u2019m an AH so do some other family members. I obviously can\u2019t take it back from Laura when I already proposed. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: \n\nThe ring was given to me not Jane. \n\nLaura has known my mother her whole life our mothers are best friends and have been hinting we should get married as long as I can remember.\n\nUpdate: \n\nMy daughter and brother decided to call my father to come to my house and talk to me. Laura was out to dinner with her friends. \n\nMy daughter and brother explained to my father their thoughts on the situation. I stayed quiet while they explained their point so that my father could really hear what my daughter was saying and so I could also hear her out. My father is a marine veteran and very blunt. \n\nMy father stopped them and said he\u2019s heard enough. He said my mother would have wanted Laura to have the ring and Jane isn\u2019t showing fhe maturity to receive an heirloom right now. He told her he\u2019s disappointed in her entitlement and that she needed to get her attitude in check by his next visit. He also reminded everyone Laura\u2019s been family for years even before we were together even if it\u2019s not by blood. \n\nMy daughter said yes sir and isn\u2019t happy about the outcome but accepts my father saying this is what my mother wanted.\n\nFinal update: \n\nSince everyone wants to know Laura\u2019s take here we go. I told Laura what was going on and that Jane is upset. I also told her the ring is hers now and she can decide who it is eventually passed down to. I know a lot of people won\u2019t agree with this but it\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. \n\nWe have a pre nup in the works for other properties we own. Laura suggested adding the ring just for secure minds and we agreed we would add that it would be given back to the family if we were to divorce. \n\nLaura will not be passing on the ring unless she passes away. That is my fathers request to her and she is honoring that. \n\nWe have spoken to Jane and I have explained all of this. I\u2019ve explained she\u2019ll always be my daughter and that won\u2019t change. She understands. She apologized to Laura and me for her behavior and explained she was just upset. Laura had a one on one talk with her as well about how she loves her and isn\u2019t trying to replace anyone or change the family dynamic we have. Jane seems to feel better.\n\nUpdate: \n\nLaura might be pregnant. Jane does know.\n\nUpdate: \n\nThe ring has been added to our will. We have decided to continue the tradition I started of the ring going to a son to give to his wife. If we do not have a son then the ring will go to a grandson or to my nephew. Since the ring will not be given to anyone until we pass we are not telling Jane that has been added to the will.",

It was given to OP, he's using it for its intended purpose, it was never promised to Jane, and being denied the ring won't materially affect Jane's life the way being denied, like, support for college would.\n\nI think the crux of why OP's being an asshole is just... the bigger context, what this all kinda says about how he's treating his kid and navigating a blended family. Jane was very close to her grandmother (and per comments her mother's in prison, so having another maternal figure in the family is probably a big deal). And now OP is getting married. I don't think kids should get to veto their parents' partners just to be resistant to change, and at a certain point you just have to adjust, but OP, in choosing to pass the ring to his partner instead of his kid, is symbolically communicating some fucked up things. That Laura was more meaningful to his mother than Jane was. That Laura is generally more of a family member than Jane is \u2014 especially because, given that it's an heirloom, Jane's probably envisioning the ring passing to her much-younger half-siblings, cementing the \"You'll have a cohesive age-appropriate nuclear family with your *real* kids and I'll be an awkward shameful hanger-on\" anxiety that a lot of kids in her position have.\n\nOP's actions just seem almost *designed* to twist the knife in every insecurity and grief that Jane has. Like yeah, it's OP's ring to do with as he likes, and in the grand scheme of things a material object itself is not that important. But Jane is a child, grieving an important maternal figure *while* adjusting to OP's marriage and the changes it'll bring to her home life *while* coming from what's likely a background of a fraught relationship with her bio mother and general instability. She wanted to feel connected to her grandmother, and feel secure in her place in her family. The fact that OP is obtuse and defensive about that his daughter's emotional needs here... upsetting, and I hope it doesn't speak to a bigger picture of how he generally treats her.",

The engagement ring was given to OP, not Jane. It was given and intended to be used exactly as OP had used it, to propose to his wife with it. The wife then becomes a member of OP's family and then passes it on to the next generation. That's exactly how family heirlooms work, and I'm sure it was the same way how the grandmother received her ring as well. There is NOTHING WRONG with what OP did.\n\nYour second paragraph seems to make sense on the surface, but it does not explain one thing, \"why does Jane need this particular ring to feel connected to the grandmother\"? You are forgetting that Jane probably had already inherited other things from her grandmother, so why does she want this specific ring to \"remember\" her by? Should Jane get the ring just because she wanted it? And if the grandmother really wanted Jane to have the ring she would've given the ring to Jane, not OP.\n\nThis post actually showcases how easy it is to manipulate the opinions of the average Redditors. Just add a child to the story and suddenly the OP is TA. Suddenly Jane is the \"real\" granddaughter and the wife is just an outsider to the family, and the future children of OP and his wife are just \"half grandchildren\" to OP's mom.\n\nJust think, would your opinions change if it was OP's niece demanding for the ring, instead of his daughter? I bet most people would be saying that OP is NTA and telling the niece to go pound sand.",

This decision has certainly injured your relationship with your daughter, perhaps beyond repair as you've made sure she will resent you and your Fianc\u00e9.

You have essentially picked your SO of 5 years over your daughter and plan to have kids that will go in to inherit a piece of jewelry that means so much to your daughter. If you do actually wind up having more kids don't count on your daughter wanting anything to do with them because she will likely resent them as being the proof you chose a potential family with your SO over your existing family.\n\n2nd ETA : OP has clearly been doing some damage control.\nA few things I would like to clear up for new viewers. OP didn't  mention jack about Laura and him growing up together or their moms being Best friends until after I made my initial post.

OP only vaguely mentioned Laura helped care for his mom without giving any other details. Nowhere in his original post or comments did OP say anything about his mom insisting that he propose to Laura while on her death bed. OP said his daughter asked him not to propose with her grandmother's engagement ring and he did it anyway. He completely disregarded the feelings of his grieving daughter even though he could afford to buy Laura an engagement ring without breaking the bank.\n\nLegally OP did have the right to do what he did, but morally he was a Major AH.",

Just being a parent doesn\u2019t mean your child\u2019s feelings and desires now trump all of your own. Especially because there are other heirloom pieces she can have. \n\nOP is using an heirloom engagement ring for precisely the reason heirloom engagement rings are often given - for a son to use to propose with.
