  "post content": "Context: Me and my wife have two sons, one\u2019s 15 (Mike) the other is 8 (Ben).\n\nMy wife wanted us to take a week-long vacation, just the two of us. There was a problem, who would watch Ben? My wife suggested that we force Mike to do it. I objected, saying \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, this isn\u2019t going to end well. Besides, we shouldn\u2019t force him, he\u2019ll just resent us\u201d. \n\nMy wife disagreed, saying \u201cConsidering how much money he costs, he should at least babysit for free\u201d. I disagreed, but she still did it anyway (when I was out, after which we left. She said that she paid him for it, and I was too tired to question her.)\n\nTurns out that I was right (in that it won\u2019t end well). To get revenge, he:\n1. Played rather vulgar music loudly, just so that Ben would hear. \n2. Repeatedly had loud sex, just so Ben would hear.\n3. Told him just about every curse word, and two slurs (n-word and the f-word, the one used to insult those who are homosexual.)\n\nI mainly blame my wife because I told her that it wouldn\u2019t end well, but she did anyway and then lied about.\n\nMy son\u2019s to blame as well, but he\u2019s 15 and was justifiably annoyed, so I don\u2019t blame him too much.\n\nWhy it might be YTA:\nSure she messed up big time, but you should at least have some sympathy. Also, why aren\u2019t you blaming the son more? He\u2019s the one who did it.\nWhy it might be NTA:\nShe did something that I warned her against, and then lied about it.\nWhy it might be ESH:\nI suck for blaming her more than my son, she sucks for going behind my back, and Mike sucks for obvious reasons.\n(Note: If you think that two of the three people here suck, say \u201cESH-Except for...\u201d)\n\nWell Jury, what\u2019s the vote?",
