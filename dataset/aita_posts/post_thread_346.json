  "post content": "\n\nhey guys! So, a bit of context I (M32) have been with my wife (F30) for 3 years. she comes from a country where women get to keep their maiden name after marriage which was fine with me though as someone who comes from the south my family pushed for my wife to take my last name but she ended up keeping hers which made my family somewhat unhappy saying it was disrespectful of her to keep her maiden name but thankfully they got over it and things got better and we reconciled later.\n\n\nnow this \"last name\" issue has been brought up again when my wife and I found out we were expecting a baby boy.\nI sat with my wife down and told her that my son is going to get my last name and explained so that there's no confusion but she disagreed and said no and came up with a compromise which was that our son gets both our last names but I declined explaining how awkward and confusing and just complicated that would be. not too mention the middle name so that would be a long name but she said I should consider since my last name will still be there but I said no and told her we'll just have to go with what most families here do and is going by the father's last name. she threw a fit calling me selfish and accused me of treating her as if she as a mother gets less or no say but I reminded her that she got to keep her maiden name and so we're even. she then argued that I was mixing two things that are unrelated and was holding the fact she got to keep her maiden over her head though it was her right to do that same with deciding what surname our son will have. I said I was sorry but I can not accept this compromise especially with how my family will react and told her she should just go with the flow and agree on my son having my last name. she got upset and refused to talk to me after that calling me selfish and a dictator and a \"minion\" for my family even though I'm just looking out for our son's best intetest and keeping them in mind.\n\nI just think she's being deliberately stubborn here. but I'm not sure. Aita?\n\n\nEDIT Jesus, whoah guys..there is just way too many responses here man and I won't be able to respond to all of them BUT I've got a couple of things to say and I'm adding them here for everyone to see.\n\n\nONE - Just to be perfectly clear here I did NOT have an issue with my wife keeping her last name. in fact I encouraged her to stick to it after my family started giving us grief about it.\n\nAnd TWO - The main reason I was initially against using both names is the fact that our son might end up having a very long name as a full name.that's it. I have nothing against my wife's last name. I respect it I respect her family (they seem sane and levelheaded) and I appreciate them a lot. but as two blended families with two different backgrounds we kinda...we tend to disagree sometimes.",

It reads as you decided for both of you \u2013 you set a fact and she has to comply. You think you can veto her because you're a man.\n\nShe didn't have to change her surname to yours and it doesn't mean that she has to name her kids after you. You didn't do her a favor by allowing her to keep her last name. She would have done that regardless of your objection and thoughts on the matter, and even in spite of them.\n\nIt sounds surreal at this point. Your wife sounds agitated and you have to think if this is a hill you want to die on. It's more than a simple dissent, it can lead to a major argument if it's not addressed properly.\n\n>she threw a fit calling me selfish and accused me of treating her as if she as a mother gets less or no say but I reminded her that she got to keep her maiden name and so we're even.\n\nIt speaks for itself at this point. Someone disagreeing with you doesn't mean that they throw a fit. You're victimizing yourself. You're the calm and logical side of this equation and she's unreasonable, crude and overstepping boundaries.",

She is able to tell hospital staff to not to let him near her and that she is the only one who can fill out the birth certificate, and they will follow her request.\n\nGo apologize and actually try to discuss/negotiate with your wife. This is not something you go tit-for-tat with. Her name has nothing to do with your son's. Either you both agree on this, or she gets to decide on her own. You need to get that through your head... and please for the love of god get off your pretentious high horse, because the \"better than thou\" attitude towards her was dripping from this entire post.\n\nYTA",

You can sit someone down and explain your unilateral decision, and calmly veto their proposed compromise, and still be an asshole. You can be quiet and rational and level-headed, and still be an asshole. These things aren't mutually exclusive. On the flipside, there are cases where the person raising their voice is totally justified in doing so, because something you said or did was shitty and it would be next to impossible to keep a level head in that situation. The tone of your voice, the delivery of your message, they can matter in many conflicts, but those things alone do not determine whether you're the asshole.\n\nHope that helps!",

I love how he says she \u201cgot\u201d to keep her last name as if he was some benevolent lord who \u201callowed\u201d her the absolutely crazy decision to determine her own name and identity. She can have whatever name she damn well pleases without his permission or approval. It\u2019s also very unhealthy to be keeping score in a marriage (\u201cso we\u2019re even\u201d). She should make sure she puts a hyphenated name on that birth certificate. That said, if I were her, and my husband \u201csat me down\u201d to tell me what we are naming the child I am carrying and going to birth, I would be gone so fast he\u2019d only have to worry about his own name and signing it on the divorce papers.\n\nOP is the biggest asshole.",

In some cultures, having long names is very normal. Even if it hadn't been, you are trying to force someone into agreeing with your decision. What if the roles had been reversed and she would try to force her last name onto you/your child? Would you not be \"throwing a fit\"? You basically already are simply because she won't roll over and let you have this. Instead, she tries to compromise, as many women tend to do. If I were her, and you kept up what you were doing, I would quit compromising and just name the kid whatever I wanted. Because if you don't want to compromise, why should she?\nAt the end of the day, she is carrying your kid. You don't have to walk around with a big belly and give up on certain things to keep your kid safe, she does. And even if she didn't have to: you're both in this relationship. You should be equals, yet here you are behaving like your say is more important and valid than hers.\n\nIf I were you, I'd think long and hard about your next actions, because if I were your wife, I would see your controlling and manipulative behaviour as abusive and toxic and would consider leaving you, as the likelihood is that it will only go down hill from this point out.\n\nYTA, OP. You and your family. Your family shouldn't have any say in this, because it's not their marriage or their child. It is that of your wife, so she's the one who should have a say. If you can't see that, if you can't love her enough to treat her as your equal, then do her and your child a favour and tell her straight up, so she can decide for herself if that's the type of relationship she wants to be in.",

My mom's father offered them a bunch of money to give my brother his last name instead of my dad's (which they declined, he was awful and they have dignity) but curiously did not make the same offer when it came to me. His logic, of course, was \"passing on the family name\", but my mom's maiden name is a pretty common one, and as far as I am aware everyone with my own last name is directly related to me, so that's both stupid and insulting. Also, my brother doesn't have kids. Also, like, who cares in any way about any of it?????",
