  "post content": "My (17m) twin sister Emily (17f) is so fucking annoying. She's a drama queen. Always pokes her nose where it doesn't belong and doesn't respect my boundaries. I hate that I have to share so many milestones with her because she always make things about herself.\n\nEmily has a best friend Jane that she always brings over to our house. She was cute but she and I didn't talk much but one day she saw me practicing on my guitar and starting talking to me. I guess that's when she got a crush on me because she asked me out a few weeks later. We had a good relationship. I was happy and felt cared for. Emily hated it per usual because she saw me as stealing her best friend even though Jane still hung out with her a lot and asked ME out. We dated for 7-8 months until I caught her making out with a senior. That broke my heart because I loved her and thought we had something special.\n\nEmily would still bring Jane over even though she knew what happened. I talked to her about not bringing Jane over because of her betrayal. She told me I need to grow up and be a real man instead of acting like a sissy. My parents took her side as well because she should have the right to bring over whoever she wants.\n\nI am on the ping pong team at school and this semester Jack joined the team. Jack is a cool guy. We quickly became friends and he invited me to his house over a lot to play video games. Apparently Emily hates Jack because he used to make fun of her hair and her weight last year. I never saw the bullying happen but knowing Emily, she probably exaggerated the whole thing because he turned her down or something. I called him over last week to play a new video game I bought. We were playing in the living room. Emily was out but when she came back and saw him, she froze. She asked what Jack was doing here. I told her Jack is my friend and we're hanging out. She went upstairs. After Jack left, she barged into my room screaming at me for bringing someone who \"traumatized\" her into our house. I told her suck it up buttercup and real women aren't scared of their bullies. I can bring home whoever I want. She called me an asshole. I called her a bitch. My parents are mad at me for bringing Jack over but I told them if they interfere, I'm going to leave and move into my uncle's house. He hates their guts anyway and would be more than happy to take me in. AITA?",

So your ex cheating on you messed with your head but your sister didn't emotionally suffer when a bully called her fat and made fun of her hair? That gives someone self-esteem issues and the fat shaming can leed to eating disorders.\nA \"real man\" doesn't date his sister's friend without considering the consequences of a fall out. A \"real man\" doesn't bring a bully into the house as revenge to torment his sister! Make no mistake you didn't bring him because he is a good friend, you brought him as payback! And, a \"real man\" recognize his bad actions and apologises instead of threatening his parents for his outcast uncle as revenge because you, a spoiled bratty drama queen, can face the consequences of your own actions!\nIs your sister self centered?! Probably. She is a TEENAGER! They are supposed to be self-centered.\nSo are you btw! GROW UP!",
