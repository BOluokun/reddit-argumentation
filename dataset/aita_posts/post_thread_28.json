  "post content": "About 6 months ago a woman drove off a very busy road, up into the parking lot at my work, and hit my truck. She must have been going at least 40mph and hit directly on the wheel of my truck because it turned my truck 90 degrees with very little visible body damage. To top it off, she had no insurance.\n\nAfter all was said and done, she caused about $18,000 in damage for which I had to pay out of pocket about $3,800 (deductible, rental car, repair costs my a-hole insurance company refused to pay). Additionally, since she didn't have insurance, I can't recover the diminished value of my truck which I think is at least $5,000 that I will never get back. Obviously this amount will go down as my truck ages but I'm pretty much stuck with this vehicle for a while now or I have to eat that cost.\n\nI had just gotten this new truck about 4 months prior then had to deal with this nearly every day for the 7 weeks it took to get repaired. It was a nightmare and very stressful dealing with this.\n\nI ended up suing her in small claims court and won by default because she did not show up. I feel like she wasn't planning on repaying me until she was trying to get her license reinstated and fortunately the state is requiring her to have a repayment plan with me before she can get her license back. She has agreed to repay me $100 every other week until paid in full. So far, I have received 1 such payment with the next due today.\n\nNow the part where I sort of feel like an asshole is that my wife and I make about $225,000 per year combined and after this lady sent me her statement of assets through the court, she has about $200 to her name and makes $400 per week as a waitress. I paid the $3,800 and sort of moved on financially. It is a lot of money, but we can afford it.\n\nShe very obviously owes me the money, but the $100 every other week very clearly would mean a lot more to her financially than me. What say you?",

Without a safety check, you can't get your car registration. Getting stopped without insurance, registration, and safety is 1k+ in fines. If you don't pay the fines, you then can't renew your license when it expires.",

It ended up costing a fraction of what I estimated due to a CA (where it happened) law I hadn\u2019t been aware of. The other driver was not insured, so the state law limits their ability to collect damages. They get the cost to repair/replace the vehicle and actual injury sustained. That\u2019s it. No pain and suffering. No lost wages. No reimbursement for a temp vehicle. Nothing.\n\nI understand poverty. I have lived dirt poor most of my life and I totally feel for people in the situation of needing to drive, but it\u2019s expensive. Thing is, a car is as dangerous as a gun and you are risking more than just yourself. The OP is lucky to be in a position where they were able to absorb this without too much negative impact to their life. That could have just as easily been someone else. Poverty is not a crime, and the system is broke as fuck, but we need to make our choices with the NOW in mind as we keep working on making it better. It\u2019s one of the many reasons I don\u2019t have kids. It would cripple us financially and I would feel so irresponsible deliberately having kids I could not afford to care for as they deserve.

My mom was a waitress off and on my whole life, and it's been standard at every restaurant she has worked at to not claim cash tips, only those made by card. My mom on paper looked broke, but in actuality would usually have a few thousand sitting under her mattress. She wasn't a big spender or anything, but depending on the restaurant and the shift worked, she could easily come home on a Friday night with a few hundred. Waitressing supported her through college with two kids, and as an \"in between real jobs\" source of income, and any skilled server at a busy restaurant can make some really good money.\n\nEdit to clarify, I don't mean serving isn't a real job, it is hard work and a very toxic work environment most of the time, my mom just used the phrase \"in between real jobs\" when she would go back to it again. It's one of the many skills she gained over her life and she uses it when she needs to.",
