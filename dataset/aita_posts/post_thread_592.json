  "post content": "First time ever posting anything so apologies if I make mistakes!\n\nOne of my friends (Let\u2019s call them Avery) brought up a conflict in a server they're in with some of their other friends (Let\u2019s call one of these friends Jay). Jay had shared a copypasta about leaving the server due to feeling left out. This made everyone on that server panic, so Avery came to me to ask about what they should do (Jay said they\u2019d leave because of the server\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d atmosphere, and I cannot speak for them on this as I\u2019m not a part of the server, but I suspect it might be another lie due to Avery saying repeatedly and recently that everyone is superbly nice)\n\nLater, Jay spoke up and said it was all a lie. Avery relayed this information to me and who we\u2019ll call Jake. Avery said another person asked Jay if it was legit, and they said it was faked. I suggested the mods on the server maybe kick that person out for that (This is where I suspect I could be seen as the a-hole here, and I understand that)\n\nJake supported me while telling Avery about my personal opinion on the matter. But Avery says I might have been overreacting, and I understand why they\u2019d said that, but I also don\u2019t think I am.\n\nThis is also all the information I was given by Avery, so there could be parts I\u2019m missing but cannot be achieved at this time due to Avery not wanting to talk (I also understand if I\u2019m the A-Hole for prying a bit) \n\nAm I the A-Hole here?\n\nsmall edit: fixed misnamed friend\nedit: gave everyone fake names for more clarity",

So friend B, let\u2019s call them Bob, made up drama about the server being toxic and wanting to leave over it, ensuing panic in the server? Then Bob basically says \u201chaha Jk?\u201d Well in that case, of course Bob should be kicked for causing drama. Did Bob give a reason for the unnecessary drama? That doesn\u2019t make you an a-hole wanting to kick someone who is creating drama where none exists. Although the entire thing sounds like a headache and I would honestly see myself out if I were in your shoes\u2026",
