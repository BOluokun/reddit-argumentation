  "post content": "I feel like an a**hole, but I wanted to post this anyway as I\u2019m hoping other people can bring me to my senses.\n\nI live in Texas and this week we got hit with major winter weather.  Texas rarely sees snow and when it does, it\u2019s barely an inch.  Last night, however, was BAD.  Snow and ice blanketed EVERYTHING.  Weather stations are saying that the last time Texas saw this kind of weather was in 1989.\n\nI work at a resort restaurant and my boss was insistent I came to work yesterday despite knowing the weather would get bad and I\u2019d likely be trapped.  My dad dropped me off as he didn\u2019t trust me to drive on the ice so I was stranded.  The resort offered a free room, but I\u2019d have to work the next day in return, which was my day off.  I was frustrated but got over it, until today when I learned I\u2019d have to stay AGAIN because the roads are too slick.  Meanwhile, my boss got his days off.\n\nI\u2019m just a bit frustrated and to let off steam, I\u2019ve been ranting to my parents about everything.  They got angry and told me that \u201cthis is an emergency\u201d and that at least my resort has power and heating while they\u2019ve lost theirs a few times.  I was told to get over it and accept that yes, I\u2019ll lose both my days off, but at least I\u2019m safe.  A big part of me knows their right but I still find myself ranting about it anyway, even though I know nothing will come of it.  And what would I even do at home anyway?  Play video games?  I\u2019d be more productive here, right?\n\nI know I\u2019m likely the bad one here and I\u2019m ready to accept that.  I have the tendencies to focus more on negatives than positives and I thought maybe some outsiders could slap some sense into me and help me see something that I can\u2019t.  I know I\u2019m safe, but I\u2019m just frustrated. \n\nHave at it y\u2019all.",

They have rolling black outs, but also presumably blankets, choice of food, theur hobbies. and clean underwear.

I didn\u2019t expect it would get THIS bad though and force me to stay for two days instead of just one.      But a lesson I took from this is to be a bit more careful and considerate of weather like this.  It\u2019s supposed to get better enough to drive tomorrow but on Wednesday, it\u2019s going to drop again and possibly snow again.  If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m going to be smart like my co-workers and call in because I don\u2019t want to risk the same situation happening again.",

As others have pointed out, its not like being at home would be so great anyway. Being the employee that's there in a pinch is a great way to work up to raises, promotions, and excellent references. And that last one is big. You sound young - establishing yourself now as a team player, hard worker, someone who shows up can really help down the line. You don't know where you will be in 10, 25 years *or where your managers will be*. You could be 8 jobs later and have your history help you out.",

Plus no one would want to drive to work in the weather we have, so it makes sense they would ask the employees they housed to work, regardless of their day off because who else would they have?  It\u2019s frustrating, but I guess it\u2019s best to use the tools you have when they\u2019re there.  \n\nMy boss\u2019s boss assured me I\u2019d get extra time off to make up for it anyway.  \n\nBut my boss is who I\u2019m more frustrated with.  He knew about how far away I lived, the weather, and that I\u2019d likely be stranded, but still told me I needed to come in.  No hesitation or choice.  When I found out the next day that he had actually chosen to go home in the middle of the storm rather than stay with us, it bugged me a lot.  I at least hope that all the workers who were stranded are honored when all is said and done.  Just a thank you so we know that what we did meant a lot.  This is something new for a lot of us.  Snow doesn\u2019t come like this often.",
