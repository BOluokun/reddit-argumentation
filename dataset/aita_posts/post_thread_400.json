  "post content": "Throw away\n\nI (34m) have a wife (32f) and we have two children 4f and 7m. I work as a manager at a care home and my wife owns a bakery with her mum. My wife cooks all the time because she is much better at cooking than I am, I cook sometimes. She is the one who takes care of the house, kids, and chores.\n\nYesterday when I came back from work dinner was ready so I plated it up for everyone while my wife was washing her hands (my kids like their food cut up) I was cutting their chickens into pieces and it looked a bit pink I told my wife to look at it and she said \u201cit\u2019s a little pink but it\u2019s fine\u201d. I told her I\u2019m not letting them eat this if it\u2019s pink, she told me to stop being a baby and it won\u2019t kill them. I kept telling her it\u2019s pink in the middle they shouldn\u2019t eat that they can get food poisoning and that\u2019s it\u2019s dangerous for them. She told me \u201cif you don\u2019t want them eating it then you can cook their dinner\u201d. \n\nI made them cheese and ham toasties, also made her one but she didn\u2019t eat it. She told me she isn\u2019t talking to me if I think her cooking is horrible. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s horrible I just didn\u2019t want our kids eating that. I told her to stop thinking she was right. So AITA?",

Also, instead of just saying \"oh honey, I am worried the chicken is a little pink, can we cook it just a little more just to be safe ?\", you went all the way \"I am not serving that to the kids!!!!\" and made a new meal altogether.\n\nEdit just for people that don't know how to cook : Chicken has to reach a temp of 165 degrees. It might still look pinkish but [it's totally fine to eat](https://www.thekitchn.com/chicken-still-pink-after-cooki-157168)\n\nAlso, the chances of getting salmonella from undercook chicken is pretty slim. The real risk is cross contamination, not undercooking.",

It was the driest, blandest chicken I have ever had (he cooked it in the oven with no seasoning or any marinate whatsoever). He was so proud to serve it to me I just smiled and ate it but was dying inside. When we started living together I told him that and we both looked for better ways to cook chicken (because I can also admit that I am not the best cook lol).",

Basically the bones are more porous, which means during cooking various heme-type compounds are forced out of the marrow and into the meat. These stay pink/red well past the doneness point of chicken; I've had deep fried hotwings that showed pinking, even though they were absolutely blasted. If you're serving bone-in chicken, unless you are cutting and checking literally every single piece prior to service, you've probably served some pinked pieces. \n\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6914/35422cd2b2d6c0cfbbd03195ebd6cc60d7eb.pdf",

Women don't have to go through the tedious process of learning how to cook like men do, how nice for them.\n\n>She is the one who takes care of the house, kids, and chores.\n\nSo she runs a business, a household, takes care of the kids, and does all the chores.

(And loving baking =/= loving working all day in a bakery and then coming home to the responsibility of preparing and cooking a meal.) But that's not what OP said, and I'm taking OP at his word. \n\nHe said that his wife is better at cooking, and that's why she does the majority of it. Just because she's better at a task doesn't mean it's fair for her to hold the responsibility for it. Just like it wouldn't be fair for her to be responsible for all of the chores, child raising, household management, etc. if she happened to be better at them than he is. You all are absolutely right; cooking isn't gendered, and neither are the rest of those responsibilities. And that's why OP should practice and build his skillset instead of justifying the uneven division of household labor by saying, \"She's better at it.\"",
