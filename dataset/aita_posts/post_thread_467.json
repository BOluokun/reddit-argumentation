He asked if he could bring his new partner of about 5 weeks because shes got nothing to do and wants to come along and meet us.\n\nI instantly said \"yeah no problem\" (because why wouldn't you?)  I trust my friends judgement.\n\nHowever, when I have mentioned this to my wife, she has gone crazy saying I shouldn't invite people round that we don't know and that its weird that this woman will just be sat around watching him work etc.\n\nAITA for thinking shes totally unreasonable?  Like I genuinely don't get why shes so mad about it.  I have offered to say \"Sorry my wife doesn't want her to come round\"  but thats not acceptable either.\n\nNeither my or the wife understand each others position, so I have come here to ask you Reddit... AITA? ",
