  "post content": "A little background info- I am short. Not incredibly short at five foot 1, but when compared to the rest of my family, it's obvious that I am lacking in stature. And ever since I was 12, it's been a huge \"joke\" at our gatherings. At first it was okay because it only felt like a bit of teasing. But it has constantly been brought up. And when I mean constantly, I mean that I will be sitting in the corner minding my own bussiness, and my cousins or my aunts and uncles will be talking and laughing about me. My grandmother is by far the worst. They don't do this to anyone else, so it sucks when they single me out.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I am so tired of it. My height was never something I was ashamed of, but with the people I love talking about it, my cousins comparing themselves to me, and my grandmother almost scolding me about it, I just want to grow 5 inches to get them off my back. By now, it has been ingrained in everyone's minds that if they are at least taller than good ol' me, then they're not that bad. It's usually little remarks so I don't want to make a scene, but today I officially mouthed off.\n\nWe were all at my uncle's house this weekend. I was sitting at the table, painting something , when my cousins came in. They were wearing high heels from my grandmother's closet and everyone found it hilarious and adorable. And that was when my uncle said \"Wow, even if OP wore those, she'd barely be bigger than y'all!\" And then my nana said something equally as stupid, something about how I wouldn't even be able to fit in those shoes anyway, with how small everything is about me. Which kind of started mutual \"teasing\" (read- mocking)  That's when I said\n\n\"Yeah guess what, guys? I had a heart condition for the first five years of my life that stunted my growth, and everyone in my dad's family is tiny. At least I have a biological excuse for being short. You don't have excuses as to why you're all a\\*\\*holes.\"\n\neveryone went quiet. My uncle was quick to scold me for the language, and my grandmother said \"We're all trying to be nice, Op. We're teasing you lovingly, giving you attention. Everyone wants attention- would you rather just be all alone, drawing? \" I told her that I would rather be left alone than have to constantly be ridiculed, and then left.\n\nEveryone has been treating me differently and I feel scummy. The youngest person there was eight, and I know I shouldn't have talked like that in front of her. So reddit, AITA ?\n\nedit- I'm a 15 year old girl if that's important",

I'm 5'3\", I didn't even realize I was SO short until random people started bringing it up on every single occasion. I would be shopping with my tall friends and the clerks would be all over them, while I'd struggle to get any assistance. People would try to cut in lines in front of me or push me off pavements. \"Sorry, I didn't see you\" - dude, you're 15cm taller, I ain't buying it. Being teased about my height had put me on the verge of an eating disorder, because I tried to compensate my \"unattractiveness\" by being skinny. \nSo, what I am trying to say is that even if something is not initially an issue for you, nasty comments will finally drill through your skull and get into your brain, especially when you're young.

The guys at work poke fun at me about it, but they\u2019ve asked me if it would bother me and I gave them the pass so long as it\u2019s not constant. I\u2019m above average intelligence and they know I\u2019m the smartest guy there, so it\u2019s a little back and forth banter. The guy over us, though, takes it to OPs level. He only ever says one of two things to me: do xyz task for work, or a short/skinny joke. Things like he\u2019s going to make me eat peanut butter instead of taking a lunch break, or \u201cit\u2019s windy today, so take a box of tile if you go outside so you don\u2019t blow away\u201d.

Just last week I had to load 50 boxes of vinyl tiles (50-70lbs each) by myself, which isn\u2019t a problem, but him belittling me while he stands there doing nothing while I work indeed is a problem.
