  "post content": "I (29F) am pregnant with my first child, a girl, and I\u2019m 7 months along. My husband and I have been arguing about the baby\u2019s name ever since we found out we were having a girl and the fights have just become more intense. \n\nHe wants to name our daughter \u201cSabrina\u201d (not the real name, but it\u2019s similar in terms of how it\u2019s a less common but not super unique name) after his dad\u2019s late mom, who he was close to. I absolutely refuse. \n\nI have two reasons, the first of which is that in my family, the eldest daughter is always named after the mother\u2019s mother. I have my grandma\u2019s name and I want my daughter to be named after my own mother. Second, my former best friend is named \u201cSabrina\u201d. Our friendship ended on pretty bad terms and I don\u2019t want to be reminded of her every time I use my daughter\u2019s name. \n\nHusband thinks the tradition is silly and that his desire to honor his grandma\u2019s memory is more important than my hangup about my former friend. I said that maybe so, but my mom\u2019s name trumps his grandma\u2019s name in terms of importance. He also refused my offer of making \u201cSabrina\u201d her middle name, and neither of us like the name\u2019s nickname. \n\nLast night I got really angry and told him I wasn\u2019t going to talk about it anymore, that I was naming the baby what I wanted because I\u2019m the one who\u2019s going to be giving birth to her and he could just suck it up. He got upset and said that he was her parent too and it wasn\u2019t fair for me to run roughshod over him. I said I wasn\u2019t running roughshod, but I was shutting down a conversation that had dragged on for too long. Now I\u2019m worried that I did overstep. AITA for taking the reins on my kid\u2019s name?\n\nEdit: Hey all. I\u2019ve been reading all of your posts and I sat down again with my husband a couple hours after posting and tried to have another conversation about this. I apologized for my anger at him the night before, but that I felt very deeply that this tradition was important to me. We talked about the fact that he knew my family has this tradition before we got married, but he says that I never made it clear that I wanted to follow it before I got pregnant. I was certain we had talked about it, and had even brought it up w/ my mom w/ him present when we were first talking about kids. He said he didn\u2019t remember, so I said let\u2019s call my mom and see if she remembers that conversation and he really didn\u2019t want to do that. \n\nVery, very long story short, it didn\u2019t stay civil for long after that and he said he was sick of fighting about everything with me and he ended up leaving to stay at his brother\u2019s house. Right now we\u2019re not sure where we stand with each other, but I think time apart is what we both need at this point.",
