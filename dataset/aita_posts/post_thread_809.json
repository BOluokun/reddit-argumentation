  "post content": "Uh ok so I know that the title makes me seem like an immediate asshole, but I swear it isn't ass petty as it sounds.\n\nlast year was my sophomore year of high school. In the district I live in, we have so many kids that the 8th graders and the freshmen go to a completely separate school than the rest of the high school, so my sophomore year was my first year of real high school. Because there are MANY more kids in the high school than in our other school, we didn't have many classes together.\n\nOne of my closest friends who we'll call Ashley (F16) was nervous about not having her classes with any of her friends. First semester was fine, but come second semester, she knew practically no one in her classes. Ashley was talking to me (M16) about how she didn't know what she was going to do about PE (you need friends in that class, trust me), and I was just telling her that she needs to put herself out there and try and meet new people. And so she did. She became quick friends with who we'll call Addison (F16). Eventually, Addison kinda becomes a part of our larger friend group. \n\nHere's where we run into some trouble. Addison and I have very different world views, because we have different perspectives. She's a young black girl and I'm a gay white guy. pretty different. She is extremely liberal, whereas I lean more conservative, and we have many differing opinions. I have zero problem being friends with someone that has a different opinion than me. But Addison likes to argue. It was fun at first, getting into little arguments, but it always leads to a heated debate where she gets REALLY emotional. Like, almost crying emotional. So that kind of got on my nerves.\n\nThe big thing though is this. I have this mental illness called OCD. My personal form of this is that I really like fives, I need to be even, I hate germs, and I like for things to be complete. Anyways, as Addison and I become better friends, I share this with her. She proceeds to be one of those assholes that's like \"oh? you obsess over germs? What happens if I touch the lid of your water bottle? ahaha\". usually, I try to not get too mad over this stuff. I just tell the person to not do that, they usually are like oh shit ok and we move on. But she will not listen. I can't even count how many times I've told her that I suffer from a real mental illness and that that she needs to stop, but she doesn't listen. Aggravating my OCD has caused problems for me outside of school too. It sucks. Even other friends of mind have tried to tell her, but she just does not get it. She tells me I just need to \"love myself\" and I'll be ok, but that's just so ignorant. \n\nAfter this shit, one day I snap. I tell her that I'm fucking over her shit and that I'm completely done with her. I also call her 'ignorant' and 'fake woke'. She cries. A lot of people in my group are mad at me. She texts me saying that what I did to her was \"not ok\". What the fuck. But it kinda made me think? Like am I overreacting?\n\nReddit, AITA?",
