  "post content": "I (21 F) and my childhood bestie. Have always been friends and she got engaged 5 months ago to her boyfriend of 6 months. We had planned our weddings since we were 14 and she wanted a castle wedding with a ballgown. Two months ago she found her dream castle in which she booked the wedding in 4 months. She just asked for a 280 dress for us plus for us to pay 1/10 of a 2000 wedding dress there's 6 bridesmaids which is 200 dollars plus a 14000 Bachelorette party which 2333.34 per person and a 600 bridal shower. The total is 2,913.34 which i can't afford i am still in university and finish in a few months  before the wedding but I am 100,000 in debt. I told her I can't pay for her wedding dress and 14000 Bachelorette party. Not even including the flight. She wanted us to also pay for makeup and hair we are not allowed togther. She also wants my hair dirty blonde I am a red head and can't dye it back. She also wants us to get her wedding gifts from the registry and pay for our own dinner. I told her at this point I can't afford that and she freaked out saying I am an A-hole cause it's her big day and I helped her plan it at 14. I told her I am not in a financial situation to do this but I can try to work my butt off to afford it. AITA if I tell her I cant afford this i don't want to ruin her wedding and our friendship.\nSo I ask AITA\nUpdate guess what he called offthe wedding and now she is trying to get a refund in everything and the down payment back and dropped out of university i feel kinda bad but karma is a b**ch",

This appears more like extortion than an invitation to be a bridesmaid. A six month relationship? Fuck me, the marriage will probably not last that long. If she was truly your friend she would understand. She is not and does not. Time to cut her loose. 110% NTA",
