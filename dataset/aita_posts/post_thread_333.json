  "post content": "Last weekend was my (26\u039c) birthday. Me and my GF of 2 years Kenzie (26F) had plans to get dinner. She came to pick me up from work and her car was packed and my best friend/his wife were in the backseat. To my surprise she planned a whole weekend away to my favorite lake, rented a sick house on the water and invited all our friends. Her sister/husband, my friends/their SO\u2019s and a few of Kenzie\u2019s friends all arrived Thursday night. It was an awesome and I was stoked for the weekend. We met thru my best childhood friend Grace (26F). Grace and kenzie were college friends and I never thought I had a chance. Kenzie is beautiful and while I\u2019m not ugly, I\u2019ve always felt like we weren\u2019t in the same league. No idea how I got her and I still don\u2019t. \n\nThursday night went well. Friday we swam and hung out at the house most of the day. We started drinking and playing games at night. Kenzie\u2019s sister broke out this couples game. Basically you pick one person in the relationship that fits the description or it has prompts to engage in debates between couples. Kenzie was pretty drunk by now because she\u2019s a lightweight and was drinking most of the night. \n\nIt was fun till a question of \u201cWhat originally attracted you to your SO\u201d. Kenzie blurted out \u201che was safe. And I knew he wouldn\u2019t cheat or leave me.\u201d I looked at her with a face and was like \u201chuh\u201d. She then says \u201cyeah you seemed nice enough and after my abusive ex I wanted a safer option\u201d. Things got really awakened and her sister quickly read a different card. I was really embarrassed and flustered so I said I had to pee and walked outside. I called Grace to tell her what happened (she was working and couldn\u2019t come) and she got upset. I told her I wanted to leave. She said I didn\u2019t need to take that and she would be there in the morning to get me. The night died down and kenzie tried talking to me in front of everyone but I told her we\u2019d talk about it another time. I decided to pack my bags and sleep on the couch. And before anyone woke up I left. I texted Kenzie and told her that I didn\u2019t want to fight about what happened and ruin everyones trip. So I was going home for the weekend and we could talk whenever she got home. \n\nShe blew my phone up all Saturday as did a few of my friends. I decided to go golfing and just turn my phone off. I just didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone. When Kenzie showed up at my place Sunday she was fuming. Saying that me leaving early ruined the whole trip. It was all anyone could talk about. And the whole vibe felt off because the birthday boy was gone. That she felt like a POS and I didn\u2019t give her a chance to explain. And she hardly even remembers what she said to begin with. She rented a boat (I love boating) and felt like I disrespected her efforts/money to put together the trip. I told her that I didn\u2019t feel like arguing so I went home to avoid the drama. Some said that it was an AH move to just bail and I should have stayed because she did put a done of effort into the trip. AITA?\n\n8am edit: I\u2019ve had some time to cool off and we are finally gonna sit down and talk out in person what happened. I\u2019m gonna get clarity hopefully and see if this is a salvageable relationship. For everyone saying it was just the \u201csafe\u201d comment. I implore you to read the entirety of what she said. Being called \u201csafe\u201d and a \u201csafer option\u201d are two totally different things. Also the \u201cseemed nice enough\u201d comment bothered the hell out of me. She tried to speak to me immediately afterwards in front of everyone while still drunk which is why I didn\u2019t want to talk. Will provide updates when possible.",

You were waiting to hear that she's discovered that your the 2020s version of Fabio?  \n\nSo, you make a huge scene, likely turn her friends against you (which can do some real long term damage) and they were probably talking the whole weekend about how actually she was wrong about her first impressions and you're actually a shitty guy (I'm not saying you are--but I bet they were).  \n\nYou say in your post \n\n>No idea how I got her and I still don\u2019t.\n\nKeep this up and she'll correct that.

Definitely, YTA, but I think acknowledging your feelings, apologizing for your reaction but also saying you just needed space to sort out your feelings (which is reasonable but should have been communicated that that's what you need cuz it's hard to talk reasonably about the problem while you're all up in your feelings still) and apologize that it killed the mood but that you did appreciate the effort she put into your birthday (which should show you she really cares about you). Looks aren't everything either, if you're upset that her main attraction to you is your personality rather than your looks, should she be equally upset if you were more attracted to her looks than her personality? She obviously likes *you* for who you are and if she found you physically *unattractive* she probably wouldn't be with you. You let your own insecurities blow this up in your head. But if it's that important to you then I suggest dating someone who's the same level of attractiveness you are to make you feel better...then you can tell *her* that you were attracted to her because she made you feel safe because she wasn't out of your league.",

And just because she commented on your character doesn't mean she doesn't also - and didn't then - like the way you look. I think you're projecting your insecurities about your physical attractiveness onto a drunk comment that likely actually means something other than what believe it does. \n\nFWIW, once I got in a relationship after having some not-so-great experiences, and one of the first things that really got my attention about this person was the fact that they also sailed over a low bar. But meeting that low bar was important to me, and a lot of other people didn't meet that low bar. And when we were still at the stage of being very new to each other, the fact that they had a certain degree of emotional togetherness and consideration for others was one of only a few things I knew about them then. It was part of what made me want to know them more, to risk investing my time and energy to see where things might got. It was what made me appreciating so much more about them possible in the first place. 'Safeness' doesn't have to mean 'I can rely on them because they can't do better.' It can mean 'this guy seems like a good guy in areas where it really counts that I can feel excited about getting to know him more and pursuing a potential relationship despite the fact that dating has been a scary/painful/dangerous thing for me.'\n\nI mean, you're certainly not obligated to continue the relationship if you don't want to, but the fact that she knows you and cares enough to arrange for a weekend like that for you makes it seem to me like it could be worth communicating about first.",

So when I met my partner as a friend first it was nice because he\u2019s a bit softer, sweet and quiet and he likes cuddling, holding hands and spending time together just playing a game or watching movies. He definitely feels safe. And that doesn\u2019t mean like, \u201che\u2019s a safe bet\u201d or a judgement on his appearance. It\u2019s more about how he\u2019s respectful and sweet. He was present and supportive when I was struggling the most and he never took advantage. He checks in on how I\u2019m feeling and if I\u2019m feeling kind of numb or if I\u2019m quiet he asks if I\u2019m okay. Consent matters a lot to him, and not just in a \u201ccheckboxes\u201d kinda way. *He\u2019s safe.*\n\n\nNot only that, but I would literally not date him (or anyone) if I don\u2019t deem him safe. It\u2019s the most important feeling for me. So idk, my first thought is that it\u2019s a great compliment and totally normal to have it as a description. Lots of women value this feeling over appearance or any other dating parameters because it\u2019s way sexier to have someone who is safe and supportive and considerate. It adds a lot to their attractiveness.",

This was *not* a thing to just abandon this whole trip over, without a conversation with anyone except \u201cGrace\u201d who wasn\u2019t even *there* who for some reason blindly supported this childish reaction.",

Apologise for leaving, acknowledge your insecurities got the best of you, but tell her her comment was really hurtful and made you doubt she's actually attracted to you at all. You realise that's a bit silly now you've had time to think, considering you've been together 2 years, but it did make you feel less than. Hopefully she apologises too and forgives OPs for his insecurity driven actions.\n\nOP needs to realise that views of attraction change as you get to know the character and personality of people. Is their relationship happy, their sex life good, and they work will together? Because from her efforts for his birthday I'd think this is a yes. She knows what he likes, wants to make him happy, and will put in lots of time, effort and money to do so. Apologise for forgetting that and show her you'll do the same for her.

But Kenzie really doesn't deserve all this malicious intent that he is projecting onto her.\n\nEven if she DID mean it in the unflattering \"he's not attractive enough to leave me\" kind of method - it's the FIRST ATTRACTED game. The first thought she had 2 years ago where she decided to give him a chance.\n\nNot why she went for a second date, or third, or 4th. Or why they've been together for 2 years. Or why she's still around planning a whole surprise birthday weekend getaway with his favorite things.\n\nKinda feels like he's let his own insecurities combined with putting Kenzie on the \"perfect hottie gf\" pedestal has had him waiting for other shoe to drop the whole time. Like, expecting it to be too good to be true and now he has the \"AHA! I KNEW IT!\" moment.\n\nSo instead of talking it out the next day, or even just discussing that her words hit a nerve and he would prefer to go home and have some space, he just ran away from the whole situation.\n\nAnd basically had a self-fulfilling prophecy of they are *definitely* now in a fight rather than just an awkward miscommunication.",
