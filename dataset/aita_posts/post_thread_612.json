My s/o has been asking since yesterday if I want to go to a restaurant or someplace else for valentine's day. unfortunately, I'm extremely drained from my work and my studies, and my social battery has been very depleted lately because of extracurricular things, which I've told them, but I keep getting asked, to which I keep telling them the same thing: that I've got to finish up my work and am unable to go out anywhere at the moment (I have a very big project due this evening that I have to get done).\n\nI feel really bad that I keep declining to go places, because I know that me telling them no is probably hurting their feelings. I've been told no to hanging out on holidays too, and I know it hurt my feelings when that happened, so it probably hurts theirs that I'm basically doing the same thing now. I'm also very much so an introvert, and after spending most of the day working and being around people, I just need that time to myself and to rest for the rest of the day. \n\nI'm not mad at my s/o at all for inviting me. I simply can't bring myself to go hang out with them today. Though I feel as if I might be the a-hole for repeatedly declining to hang out with them, especially because it's Valentine's day.\n\nSo, AITA for saying no to the date invitation?",

They should already know, but some people take VD as a special day to *proclaim your love from the hilltops*.\n\nMaybe make up a cheesy voucher for a night out in the next week, when you'll have time and VD stuff will have died down a bit.",

So he just brought over a quick takeout and flowers, came ate with me and left me to my work to go about the rest of his day. It wasn't anything fancy, but I really appreciated that he didn't make a fuss and I dindn't need to do anything. Celebrations like these shouldn't be about creating more stress for people!",

Your partner isn't an asshole really, but it is rude to *keep* asking after you said no once. That's called pressuring someone, and can produce coerced results. You wouldn't be asking yourself if you're an asshole if they did the right thing and accepted your answer.",
