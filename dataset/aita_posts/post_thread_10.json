  "post content": "I got pregnant in college when I was 19. Her father was in the same position. Prior to doing the deed, I told him if anything were to happen I would not be getting an abortion. He said he understood. \n\nWhen I got pregnant, he refused any contact with my baby or responsibility. He took things further by telling my friends and his family that I planned the pregnancy to trap him, so they wouldn\u2019t judge his actions. This was untrue. He paid mandatory child support but it wasn\u2019t much. \n\nIt was hard but I love my daughter and wouldn\u2019t change a thing. She\u2019s wonderful and smart and she\u2019s my whole world. \n\nHe reached out to me on Facebook saying he wants to be in his daughters life. He\u2019s married now. I did some stalking online, his wife has frequently posted about her infertility struggle. \n\nI was against it because he\u2019s had no part of her life. It was me who had to drop out of college, work 2 jobs, endure the sleepless nights as a baby and raise her. It was me that kept her belly full and kept her warm. He didn\u2019t give a shit. It was me that endured my friends turning against me and his family\u2019s harassment. And the judgment of society for being a young mom. And now that he wouldn\u2019t be sacrificing his young years, now he\u2019s finished partying, now he\u2019s got his degree and job, and his wife can\u2019t give him kids to complete his picket fence life, he wants the kid I raised for him? Knowing he doesn\u2019t really have to do any work other than pick her up now and then. \n\nI told him my thoughts, and he got mad saying that I chose to have the baby not him, which tipped things over for me. I asked him to prove he thought about her, eg a college fund he\u2019s paid into for a while with her in mind or car money. He did not, which again proved to me he only gave a shit when he couldn\u2019t make more kids. \n\nI spoke to my daughter but I told her the type of person her father is. I told her he has nothing for her, and I was honest about the fact his wife is infertile so he is reaching out. I told her everything and reiterated basically everything I said in the post. \n\nI told her to think about it, I said I\u2019d support her knowing him, but I affirmed he is not a nice person and his intentions are not where we would want. She chose to not know him. \n\nAfter I informed him he got mad. He said I ruined his chance to know her, that I\u2019m denying her a father, I told him he was the one that did that. \n\nMy mother told me I shouldn\u2019t have poisoned his image to her, that she probably feels rejected all over again and she\u2019s probably hurting. I now feel like I have done wrong by her. AITA?\n\nEdit: she is 16 now\n\nEdit 2: if it wasn\u2019t for the infertile wife, and lack of college fund or car money (showing evidence he had at least thought about her) then I probably wouldn\u2019t have said anything to her about what he is like. But to me those were red flags\n\nEDIT 3: FAQ\n\nhe never told me he didn\u2019t want kids, he didn\u2019t tell me he wouldn\u2019t stick around for the kid when I told him I wouldn\u2019t abort before anything. \n\nDespite this I\u2019m NOT MAD HE LEFT. I am mad he returned  for the WRONG REASONS which could be harmful to my daughter. \n\nI am not answering questions on how I got pregnant as this is not relevant. The amount of people I\u2019ve had comment \u201cwell were you on birth control?\u201d and the lack of \u201cwell did he wrap it up?\u201d  If you\u2019re trying to find out if I poked holes or lied about taking the pill, I did not. If you\u2019re about to accuse of having unprotected sex, again, I did not. \n\nDo not ask why I didn\u2019t abort my daughter or refer to her as a consequence. This is rude and you know it. My choice to have my daughter was my choice alone and not his fault, therefor not relevant",

It is one thing for him to give up parental rights and for it to remain that way, but what he is doing is treating her like she is some sort of trend of the month. What is going to happen when he realizes she is a complex, multilayered human with a lot of thoughts and feelings and likely a lot of negative feelings towards him?\n\nI wouldn't trust him with properly taking care of an animal, let alone a child.",

It's hard enough being a parent, let alone in that kind of situation. \n\nI would say one thing though... try not to let your feelings about him cloud your judgement too much. I never knew my SD, I only ever had what my mum told me, and she never hid the fact that she didn't want me to have anything to do with him. I didn't get the chance to form my own opinion of the man, and for all I know he was mildly decent. And there is a (small) part of me that wishes I could have met him before he died, if only to see for myself who he was. And that part of me will never forgive my mum for denying me that.\n\nYour daughter may never get to that point. But for her sake, and the sake of your relationship with her, don't stand in the way if she changes her mind and wants to get to know him. Yes, he may break her heart, but at least she can find out for herself.",

And that's how she explained him to us when we wondered why he was so angry. She would tell us, \"he loves you, I promise. It's not okay for him to do that, and you can never show love that way because it's unacceptable. But also, he is a human. With past trauma and demons, and none of that is YOUR fault.\"\n\nShe did so well trying to balance us having him and his family, while trying to make sure he didn't do us any harm.

I don't keep them from their dad but I am honest with them about his traits and how that may negatively impact them. He never showed much interest after I was done with the relationship about 5 months after my youngest was born.  I can count on one hand the number of visits (a few hours max) thay have had with him since. Last year he texted me out of the blue asking if he could come \"see them.\" I resisted the urge to ask what his plan was for long term and just said yes. He showed up late with nothing in particular planned. Only my middle child wanted to stay with him overnight at his hotel (we live in different states). He took them to Dave and Busters and we planned a lunch for the next day except he left without telling them the next day as we waited for him to go to lunch( kids wanted an outing with both parents which is understandable and that we both agreed on). Maybe 6 hrs of them wondering (me knowing he is an inconsiderate asshole) where he was or if something happened to him. I had called him twice with no answer. I took them to lunch anyway and my younger two broke down crying at the table (I asked if they wanted to leave and they said no).  We went home and he finally called my middle son, not me, and said he had to leave because he found out I had filed for child support (after YEARS of him not contributing ANYTHING).  Queue me going off on him and my kids going of on him. I wish they had not had to feel what they felt that day.  But I also didn't want to keep him anyway just on the slim chance he actually matured some. It fucking sucks. But they now know that he can't be depended on and I didn't have to say anything bad about him for them to see that.",

After they divorced in the 70s (three children later) he still wasn't much interested in the three of us). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce we got older, my brother reached out to him  while going to college, asking for a little financial help with textbooks, and received screaming obscenities in return. Well, brother is an aerospace engineer now and making six figures. Now my father wants to be all buddy buddy with him. My brother ain't buying it. My father has never met my brother's children and never will.\n\nMy sister decided to give my father another chance after my mother died. Her children were very close to my mother and they were devastated by her unexpected death (she was only 53). He was very gung ho about spending time with them, but that lasted about 3 months before he got bored and stopped calling them or coming by. They were 5 and 10 years old, so that was fun for her trying to explain why their grandfather didn't come to see them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe did the right thing. NTA.",

Dad randomly left basically overnight after selling the house they lived in without anyone knowing (!). Fucked off to another country with some girl who was 40 years his junior. Also found out he\u2019d been married twice before and has a few other kids no one (including his current wife of 20 years) knew about.\n\nYears of legal drama ensued. During that time, my friend went to uni and because her parents were not divorced yet and he had had a reasonable income, she wasn\u2019t eligible for scholarships. She basically survived on scraps, taking every damn job she could find. A couple years in, she wrote her dad a letter to ask for a little bit of support, 100$ a month would make a huge difference etc. He responded with a 4-page letter as to why he won\u2019t give her anything. Motherfucker. Note that in my country you are obliged by law to support your children up to a certain age, so she could\u2019ve even sued him, but opted not to.\n\nFast forward 15 years later: all children are exceptionally smart and pretty much all of them managed to graduate with a gazillion degrees, PhDs and whatnot, and went on to get decent jobs. None are rich and they\u2019re all very humble anyway, but certainly make a good living. Dad is pretty old now and suddenly wants to be in touch with his kids, plus asks for money, and is surprised if neither has any interest to even see him, much less give him money. \n\nI guess that\u2019s called karma.",

My mom kept everything a secret, and even though he wouldn\u2019t pay child support she still let me see him on the weekends (when he had time and wasn\u2019t busy going out with friends). I grew up idolizing him, because as a kid, all I knew was I\u2019d get to eat donuts for breakfast lunch and supper. But as an adult, now that my mom has told me how he acted when I was younger, I wished I\u2019d never visited him. \n\n\nHe has all the time in the world for me now that I\u2019m an adult, but growing up he never went to recitals, never paid for dance class or sports. He gave zero financial (or emotional) support. I think I had more heartbreak over this realization, than I would if my mom had let him leave and allowed me to make the decision if I wanted that relationship. \n\n\nIt may have hurt your daughter to know that her dad didn\u2019t actually want her, but so long as she\u2019s reminded that you love her, you raised her, you\u2019ll always be there for her, I think it was the best division you made.

My exes had mom who hided from them the truth about the fathers, both spent their entire childhood missing their dad, and both developed real \"daddy issues\". One of my exes went looking for her father and when he rejected her, it broke her even more, all because her mom wasn't honest about the type of men he was when she was growing up. (She did tell her when she started looking for him, but then it was too late)\n\nThe other was able to regain some sort of contact, but she's not a person next to him. He doesn't care much about her, the relationship is one sided, and she just accepts any scrap of attention from him. It's extremely unhealthy.\n\nPeople I know who's mom were honest, don't have any issues.

So when OP got pregnant, he panicked because he wasn't expecting his actions had consequences and he scapegoat his way out of it by saying OP trapped him. Just so he could get of scott free and continue his party life before he settled. \n\n16 years has passed and not once was he interested in his daughter that is when his wife is coincidently having trouble conceiving. Now he wants to know his daughter? He thought his wife was going to give him kids and he could forget about his daughter. His life plan was to continue to party, then settle down and marry, then have kids with his wife and OP's daughter was not a part of this vision. His wife having trouble conceiving disrupted his vision and now he's scrambling to get his supposed \"one chance\" at being a father and he feels OP is purposefully blocking him by her telling her daughter the truth that his love is conditional. Meaning daughter has to think about what if his wife do conceive successfully? How is he going to move forward in a relationship with her after the fact? That he already abandoned her once means he could do it again. And daughter recognized that and noted out of wanting to know him\n\nIn addition, I can't imagine a woman who is having infertility troubles is going to be open towards a teen daughter around her. She will know he had sex with another woman before her and even had a child with her but they're married and she's having trouble giving him a child. I'm sure he's fed her lies about his relationship with OP and the daughter and having the daughter around while she's going through emotional distress is probably going to make her resentful. She'll be resentful of the daughter being a real human being and proof that her husband is fertile enough to have kids while she's struggling and she'll be resentful of the thought that her whole worth seemed to be narrowed down to her ability to conceive because why is her husband bringing his teenage daughter around all of a sudden when he had no interest in her before?",
