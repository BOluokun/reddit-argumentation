  "post content": "I (26M) had to move back in with my mom (55) and step dad (55) due to a variety or reasons. Whilst I appreciate the support theyve given me Ive had so many other things happen that just seem to make it worse.\n\nLast Nov. I basically had a seizure and my work took me entirely off the  schedule so ive been without a job in the diagnostic process to figure out whats wrong with me including also soon to be seeing a psychiartrist.  This has compounded the issues since the economy sucks and I cant seem to find a job to replace the one i lost. That and im suppposed to do chores as \"my rent\" to which i do and dont complain about it since its fairly easy.\n\nI sometimes have some issues remembering to do tasks or forget i was supposed to do something. To which my step dad seems to love calling me a lazy piece of shit. This kind of stuff has been building up over years since I was 11. Over and over again getting berated and told im just like my useless birth dad who went to prison. \n\nI am trying to find work, i am trying to stay on top of chores to balance this out with the stress of dealing with my medical BS. Tonight it was like a bottle exploded and I just lost it on my mom tellimg her that I dont care if my step dad gets hit by a truck, that i see him as a manipulatice abusive asshole. \n\nShe keeps trying to reassure me that hes helping me but I just dont see it. She told me he is trying to treat me like he did for his kids when they were younger, i told her that she actually taught me to love her and he taught his kids to fear him.\n\nI dont want to live here anymore, but i am stuck and each day the tension between my step dad and I keep getting worse. Ive lost all respect ive ever had for him after his comments tonight. He never says anything positive only trash talks me and tells me how useless I am. \n\n Theres so much context i cant quite put in due to restrictions but im more than willing to add information if asked.

My son got very anxious during it because who really wants to do that for hours even with breaks?\nI am not a Physician, it sounds like a focal point seizure. I have sadly witnessed three relatives  have seizures. A full grand Mal where there was loss of bowel control and 10 minutes where they moaned and were unresponsive. My son drools and goes \u201cout\u201d. I have also sat with him to help him through the feeling when he \u201cmay have one.\u201d \n\nYou gotta ignore step dad. Do not think about past incidents and just get your body well. I am a step mom of ten years to four kids and my idea of parenting is nurturing. Your stepdad parents how he thinks is right, even if he is unkind. Push through and get the care you need. Get out as fast as you can. Do the chores. Your mom gave you a place to land. Unfortunately stepdad won\u2019t have a come to Jesus moment.\n\nEdited to ask: do you feel like your anti seizure meds affect your reaction to people?",

Whilst I appreciate the support theyve given me Ive had so many other things happen that just seem to make it worse.\n\nLast Nov. I basically had a seizure and my work took me entirely off the  schedule so ive been without a job in the diagnostic process to figure out whats wrong with me including also soon to be seeing a psychiartrist.  This has compounded the issues since the economy sucks and I cant seem to find a job to replace the one i lost. That and im suppposed to do chores as \"my rent\" to which i do and dont complain about it since its fairly easy.\n\nI sometimes have some issues remembering to do tasks or forget i was supposed to do something. To which my step dad seems to love calling me a lazy piece of shit. This kind of stuff has been building up over years since I was 11. Over and over again getting berated and told im just like my useless birth dad who went to prison. \n\nI am trying to find work, i am trying to stay on top of chores to balance this out with the stress of dealing with my medical BS. Tonight it was like a bottle exploded and I just lost it on my mom tellimg her that I dont care if my step dad gets hit by a truck, that i see him as a manipulatice abusive asshole. \n\nShe keeps trying to reassure me that hes helping me but I just dont see it. She told me he is trying to treat me like he did for his kids when they were younger, i told her that she actually taught me to love her and he taught his kids to fear him.\n\nI dont want to live here anymore, but i am stuck and each day the tension between my step dad and I keep getting worse. Ive lost all respect ive ever had for him after his comments tonight. He never says anything positive only trash talks me and tells me how useless I am. \n\n Theres so much context i cant quite put in due to restrictions but im more than willing to add information if asked. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There are a number of conditions that could cause both seizures and memory problems, so that can be very valuable info. \n\nIf it's just normal for you to kind of forget things like everyday chores though (which is super common and not a character flaw), then something as simple as a list could make things a whole lot easier for you. If writing it on paper doesn't work, there are a billion apps for this kind of thing. Yes it can be tedious, but it might get him off your back and reduce some of the stress you're dealing with.",
