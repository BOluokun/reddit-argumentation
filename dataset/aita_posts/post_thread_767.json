  "post content": "Asking about/for a friend.\n\nMy friend's been in a relatively loveless marriage with her husband, let's call him B, for several years, & they have 2 young children together.\n\nI met them both a few years ago, early into the marriage, & have always been cordial with B. They've always seemed like a bad fit for one another. Conflicting personality types, different hobbies, even different tastes in food. But they're married, I always figured they had some deeper connection. Also, I didn't feel I knew her well enough to say anything.\n\nOver the years though, the conflicts between them have escalated, and a few months ago I felt so uncomfortable by a fight they had in front of me that I had to say something to her. I told her it often seemed like they were a bad match for each other, because of their many differences. I also felt he was being mean & dismissive to her.\n\nAt that point, she told me a lot that I didn't know. For one thing, the meanness--which she describes as \"contempt\"--is apparently a personality trait that she's been trying to parse for years. He seems to genuinely want to understand why she is upset in a given situation, but despite his sincerest efforts, he can't seem to put himself in her position mentally. \"He lacks empathy,\" is what she told me. \"He doesn't mean to, and he doesn't think he does, but he can't understand other ppl's feelings.\" And then, she says, he gets mad.\n\nTBH I was a little dismissive of this cuz I thought that was kind of a cop-out way to avoid the real issue of being poorly matched for one another. I asked if she'd ever brought it up to him, she said yes, but he got so offended & angry that she never wanted to bring it up again.\n\nSo fast forward to yesterday. My friend told me that they'd been going to see a marriage counselor for a few months. She specifically found a marriage counselor who specializes in spectrum disorders, but not in a conspicuous way, so as to keep the information from B. After several long meetings, the counselor agreed with my friend that yes, B \\[might be\\] on the spectrum, and yes, he appears to be unable to empathize w/ other ppl. This helped to explain a lot of confusing behavior for my friend, because she did not want to believe that he actually \\*was\\* as unkind as he had been behaving towards her. The counselor's agreement was comforting to her because it gave her a framework through which to understand his behavior.\n\nMy friend feels relieved to have some answers, though of course the challenge now is B doesn't have a clue. It sucks that she did it so secretively, I'm sure he'll think she's an asshole, but I feel like, maybe that's to be expected, given the circumstances?\n\nSo... I guess what I'm asking, IS my friend TA for having him evaluated behind his back?\n\n*edit: I did not mean to imply that all people with ASD cannot feel empathy, learn how to act on empathy even if it's not first nature to them, or understand feelings. I do not believe that, & I apologize if it reads that way. The 3000 character limit forced me to delete a lot of context about my two friends, and I did not mean to be reductive or ableist in my depiction. I added a bit more to clarify.*",
