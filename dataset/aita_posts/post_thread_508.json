  "post content": "My sister in law wanted to do some family portraits as a Christmas gift to their parents. This was supposed to be to back in October of this year but we had to cancel because my husband couldn\u2019t get off work (he\u2019s a resident physician so he doesn\u2019t get more than 4/5 days off a month \u2014 including weekends. He works a ton). \n\nWe also have a newish baby. She\u2019s almost 6 months old and would have only been 3 months at the time and generally cranky all the time so it\u2019s best we pushed it out. \n\nSo my husband found a kind-of free weekend in February (he would work till 3am Friday night and we\u2019d leave Saturday morning) to back to his hometown 3.5 hours away to do these photos. \n\nHe told me about the window and I\ufe0f was like okay perfect we can do that, without checking my schedule (I\ufe0f know I\u2019m a big a hole for not checking the calendar). When I\ufe0f finally did check the calendar last night as I\ufe0f was filing in his work schedule to it, I\ufe0f noticed that the weekend he mentioned is lunar new year. I\u2019m Chinese and it\u2019s a big deal in my family. It doesn\u2019t help that it changes every year so planning for it is a doozy. And I\ufe0f have a baby so forget planning in general. \n\nHe told his sister that there was a weekend in February that might work but didn\u2019t say when but now that I\ufe0f know it\u2019s lunar new year I\u2019m torn. My family is definitely going to want us to join for the holiday and I\u2019m happy to go alone and let him go back with his family but the issue is our daughter. Both sides will want her and she will default to coming with me as I\u2019m the food source. \n\nWIBTA if I\ufe0f asked my husband to do lunar new year with my family as it is our daughters first new year but in return offer to pay for family photos here where we live on a day off that he has and his family can come to us?\n\n\nEdit: his pediatric ICU schedule came out and he was able to get a golden weekend (both a full Saturday and Sunday off)! So we can make it work! \ud83e\udd73",

Reasonable people can work out something else just as long as you give enough time, so make sure this is communicated soon.\n\nIt sounds like the biggest obstacle here isn't you or your side of the family's traditions, it's your husband's schedule. He is the one who really needs to focus effort on this to find something that works for everyone (note: he's also not an AH for this, his work schedule sucks for reasons beyond his control).",
