  "post content": "\nThrowaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad.\n\nI was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she\u2019s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s fine I have my dads credit card I\u2019m not paying \u201d which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I\u2019ve told my son multiple times he\u2019s never allowed to use my card so I\u2019m interested to see how this girl thinks she\u2019s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.\n\nWe end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can\u2019t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn\u2019t her card but her father\u2019s and I\u2019m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I\u2019ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don\u2019t think she was ever told no.\n\nGirl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it\u2019s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I\u2019ve pointed out it wasn\u2019t hers cashier tells her she can\u2019t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it\u2019s still fraud. Girl says it\u2019s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she\u2019s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong. \n\nSo Reddit, ATIA?",

To everyone saying that she could have taken the card without permission, you are right. But it is still none of OP\u2019s business and there is no way to know for sure. \n\nIf the girl was an adult who said she was using her husband\u2019s card, OP likely wouldn\u2019t have batted an eye.",

But when I mentioned to my friends that our parents literally taught us how to fake their signatures, they thought it was bizarre. Then again, I'd say me and my siblings were (relatively?) good kids. Our parents were always good at staying on top of school stuff or whatever, so we only ever had to forge their signatures when they were genuinely busy and needed to sign something, but forgot to, so they'd tell us kids to sign for them. Other few times were to confirm identity in cases like this post, when they sent us off shopping without them.\n\nOne instance that comes to mind is spring break a few years ago. My (then underage) brother went to Florida and wanted to get a hotel room for him and a bunch of friends. To pay for the room, he needed a signed form that said he was allowed to use the credit card that my mum had given him for the trip. She and my dad were away on vacation at the time without access to a scanner or printer, though, so my mum emailed the form to me. I printed it, signed her signature for her, and scanned it back in an email, which she then forwarded to the hotel with a picture of her I.D. Everything was fine and dandy, and my brother got the room with his friends.\n\nTLDR; I've been in situations like the girl in OP's post, and my parents would be pissed off if somebody like OP butted their noses in unnecessarily, despite giving me full permission to use their card/money/whatever lol",

He sees his own statement and can question me accordingly. It's not up to a stranger to question my form of payment. This is especially true with a credit card. Even if it was stolen, most major credit cards have a way to dispute unauthorized purchases and deactivate the card.\n\nSo yeah, YTA",
