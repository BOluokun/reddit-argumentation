  "post content": "Wife and I own a home in an HOA. We split the mortgage and HOA fee 50/50. Recently a vacancy opened up on the Board of Directors and I applied for it and was chosen to serve. As compensation, the HOA fee ($400) is waived for our unit. My wife wants to split this windfall 50/50. I feel since I\u2019m on the Board and do all the work, the $400 should be all mine. She thinks if I keep the $400 it\u2019s tantamount to her *paying me* $200 since our overall housing costs have dropped $400 but she doesn\u2019t benefit financially. This has caused some of our worst fighting and I am leaning towards just giving in and splitting the money even though\nI do all the work. Am I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE: I\u2019ve seen the err of my ways and will split the rebate with my wife. Before I get into it, I just want to say there are some very sick people on this subreddit who think they know things about me and my wife with absolutely no basis in fact. But hey, it\u2019s the Internet. Expect trash. As for the many people who commented like a normal person and especially the Redditors who DM\u2019ed me and agreed with or validated my position, thank you. Ultimately, u/flyryan convinced me with saying \u201c[t]he perk you are getting is no longer having to pay the HOA fees. Not a salary of $400/mo. They are saying your household no longer has to pay THEM for their service and you are turning around and collecting $200 from your wife. You\u2019re essentially getting a free service (HOA membership) as a perk for your volunteer work and then reselling half of that service to your wife for $200. She is no longer paying HOA fees, but rather YOU to be HOA president.\u201d \n\nAnyway\u2014while I still believe my position has some logic behind it, I now see my wife\u2019s perspective which helps soften my stance considerably. So I will share it.",

Like me and my husband don't have a joint account. We just pay the bills we are responsible for and then do our own thing. But we've talked about savings, and our goals. We talk to make sure neither of us feels taken advantage of. We both have our spending money.\n\nMaybe it's because we are lucky we don't have to budget. But it's never felt like we needed a joint account. I'm definitely the spender of the two of us. So I've never been like ugh I wish he would stop spending money on unnecessary things. And he definitely views his savings as our savings, my name just isn't on it. And I trust him not to spend that money without us talking about it. \n\nAnd honestly I make next to nothing compared to him. Think 10k compared to 100k. So he pays pretty much all the bills. If I did more than groceries I'd probably want a joint for bills. But I would still want a personally account too. I do think it's important to have personally money your spouse has no say in. If I want to save money for however long to treat myself to any expensive item, I shouldn't have to ask permission to do that. So having a personally account allows for that much easier. Cause I get the whole it's a joint account, you can't just take 5k and spend it however you want. And I do not want to always be in that situation.",

This whole post doesn't make sense but if I could volunteer for something and waive 400 dollars of a fee my partner and I pay, I wouldnt expect my partner to not benefit from that. \n\nOP's hyperfixation on the fee waiving being the only benefit to being on the HOA is wild. Dude has power to make changes as a member of the HOA and is acting as though that too isnt a perk.\n\nEdit: other comments are saying he wants wife to pay him the 200. Absolutely wild.",
