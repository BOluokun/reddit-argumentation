  "post content": "Throwaway so no one I know finds this (sorry for the format I\u2019m on mobile) \n\nSo this one girl who I\u2019ll refer to as D (22F) who I\u2019m acquainted with posted something on her Snapchat story, it was something along the line of \u201cI honestly want one of my besties to have a baby because I want to be auntie and have a niece/nephew and don\u2019t come after me because I know you\u2019d want the same thing\u201d and honestly it rubbed me (20F) the wrong way because I\u2019m childfree and have no plans to ever have kids so when people pressure others or say things like this, it upsets me, annoys me and honestly it\u2019s not their business \nSo a few hours after I made my own post on my Snapchat story in response and although it wasn\u2019t towards D\u2019s post specifically, it was the last straw the made me do it\n\nMy response in summary was \n\u201cIt's frustrating when people pressure others to have kids. Pregnancy can be risky, and raising children can be expensive and mentally challenging. It's important to respect that some people choose not to have kids at all. I recently saw  posts that  pressure people to have kids, and it's disheartening how common this behavior has become. Ultimately, people's choices about their lives are none of our business.\u201d\n\nI had a bunch of replies supporting and validating this claim but although I didn\u2019t call out anyone specifically D figured out I was talking about her and replied to my story by saying it was a joke and if I don\u2019t like her posts then to un add her, but I didn\u2019t want to do this yet \n\nSo the day after I made another Snapchat story to hopefully clear things up and maybe even have D see where I\u2019m coming from, in short I mentioned\n I was childfree and when people pressure others to have kids it upsets me  and how saying it\u2019s a joke is not always an excuse I also said it\u2019s like making joking about pregnancy on April fools which can hurt people who are struggling with infertility or had a miscarriage in the past, (which D has said in the past that this joke is disgusting and offensive) I lastly said It would be the last story I made on the topic because I didn\u2019t want to cause any more drama\n\nBut of course this didn\u2019t work and made things work because D respond to the story and said that I started the  drama and that she didn\u2019t ask for my opinion and how it\u2019s petty to keep posting about it on my story\n\nI responded that I understand it was a joke but it just made me uncomfortable and that I\u2019m sorry if my Snapchat stories seem petty and that this was my last story on the topic and I want to move own\nWe bickered a little bit\n\nUntil D said she doesn\u2019t care anymore and that it\u2019s not her fault I can\u2019t take a joke and how I could of just kept it to myself\nWhich I find kind of hypocritical because as I mentioned she\u2019s ranted  about jokes she finds offensive in the past and yet she gets mad when I do the same?\nAs far as I know at least one of my closest friend and some of my other friends on my Snapchat are on my side\nBut D claims everyone on her snap knew it was a joke\n\nI honestly want other opinions and I know she thinks I am but AITA for starting all of this to begin with?\n\nEdit: Okay I get it, I\u2019m the AH here. I won\u2019t do something like this again unless it\u2019s a really offensive joke like a racist joke or something and if I really need to rant about a joke or any post like this then I\u2019ll probably just rant about to a friend or something.\n\nBut I would appreciate it if ya\u2019ll didn\u2019t make assumptions about me. This is the only time I\u2019ve done something like this (and now probably the last lol) I\u2019m usually pretty silent about my feelings or anything on social medias or almost anywhere for that matter.\n\nBut why did this of all things made me so upset and felt a need to rant about it and make a Snapchat story about it? Honestly I can\u2019t really answer that since I\u2019m not entirely sure myself, something inside me snapped I guess, I can\u2019t really explain it.\n\nAs for D, I just decided to un add her and block her on all socials we had each other on. Mostly because she said to un add her if I don\u2019t like what she posts\nWe weren\u2019t really that close anymore as much as we use to be, and she probably wants nothing to do with me after this anyway so it\u2019s not that big of a deal.\n\nEdit 2: I have no clue why it says No A-holes here when there were clearly more YTA votes",

She said she wants to be an aunty, not that she wants you to have children against your will.\n\nYou're not an asshole for not wanting children, but man, you sound tiring to be around if you're going to take every small social media comment this seriously and personally.   So much drama for something so miniscule.  Just because people are infertile does not mean nobody can mention children or parenthood publicly anymore, just because my dad got cancer doesn't mean nobody can talk about cancer in my presence, just because I failed out of algebra doesn't mean others can't talk about how excited they are about their math degree.   If you don't like her posts, don't read them.  The infertile of this world do not need your crusade.\n\nNAH, this is the danger of social media - If you express your opinion, in either a light hearted or serious way, you're bound to piss someone off out there.  You and she just need to accept that not everyone agrees with you and move on.",

She just said jokingly she wanted one of her friends to have a baby, which I'm assuming could have been anyone. And even at that, just laugh it off and say fat chance. I'm childfree myself and I gotta say the childfree community on here is just over the top gross and I find a lot of childfree people get so worked up about it any chance they get. \n\nI simply just started telling people \"I'll never have kids, I don't like them and don't want them in my life, and I got a vasectomy to make sure that happens\" end of story. If they poke and prod, let them or bluntly say \"kids suck ass and I never want one\" lol it usually ends the torment.",
