  "post content": "I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m (M26) dealing with some heavy stuff right now. I was in an accident last December that killed my best friend &left me paralyzed from the waist down. This is a dramatic change in my life that I still struggle with, not being able to walk again, losing someone I love, dealing with survivors guilt and other emotional stuff that leaves me in a dark place.\n\nBefore this, I was never religious and neither is anyone in my family except my cousin. She\u2019s tried for years to drag everyone to her church. \nIt feels like ever since this happened, she\u2019s used my accident to prove God is great because there was a high possibility I wasn\u2019t going to make it and he \u201csaved me.\u201d It\u2019s all she talks about with the family.\n\nWhile dealing with all the physical and emotional trauma that comes with this, my cousin hasn\u2019t stopped bothering me about going to church with her to thank god for this miracle, which still doesn\u2019t feel like that to me but I\u2019m trying to work that out in therapy.\n\nI\u2019ve told her *many* times that\u2019s not my belief and church is the last place I want to be.\n\nIt\u2019s got worse now that the church services are online so she literally comes to my place so we can watch together. I ask her to leave and it takes a few times until she does. \n\nI reached my breaking point last week when again she insisted when we were all having breakfast. At the table she talked about God having a plan and how sometimes he makes things happen *mentions my accident* so we can open our hearts to him. \n\nSo I asked her, \u201cyou\u2019re saying God\u2019s plan was to almost have me killed and leave me in a wheelchair just so I could thank him for not killing me after all?\u201d My cousin didn\u2019t know how to answer that and I bitterly told her \u201cno offense but *your* god sounds very toxic.\u201d\nA few of my cousins thought it was funny but everyone else didn\u2019t know how to react. Then we just changed the subject but she didn\u2019t talk anymore after that.\n\nOfc I get the txt from her about how she was just trying to help and she deserves an apology for being so disrespectful about her religion. Everyone is kind of annoyed with her too and my mom says she doesn\u2019t like the way she\u2019s been using my accident either. My dad feels I did go too far and should\u2019ve just kept my mouth shut because in her mind, she believes she is in fact helping me.\n\nI\u2019m glad I at least have some peace since she\u2019s not talking to me but she now she\u2019s spreading word around that I insulted her when all she\u2019s done at this point is \u201chelp\u201d me through this period in my life. \n\nDon\u2019t know if I was being a justifiable a-hole, complete a-hole or not one at all. Guess I\u2019ll leave that to all of you",
