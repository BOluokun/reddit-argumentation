  "post content": "Me (24f) works 12 hr shifts\nGf (28f)\n\nMy gf and I got into an argument when we got home from her picking me up from work.\n\nI ended up being about 15 minutes late getting out of work. A mgr asked me and a coworker to clean up about an hour before end of shift. It took longer than expected. When I realized (about 8 minutes late) I txtd her and apologized. She txtd me smth about not being able to say no and being walked all over. Clearly she was upset.\n\nWhen I got in the car I didn't bring it up but I could tell she was irritated. We end up talking about it and she says the same thing in the txt. I tried to explain that it wasn't me being taken advantage of but didn't really go anywhere.\n\nThen she brings up smth I had txtd her earlier. I had asked if she wntd to \"go CC shopping\". CC means custom content and she didn't know that so she thought I was talking about actually going somewhere. We cleared that up in txt but she asked what it was in the car. She was still upset, had attitude and it was starting to bother me. She was saying I give her only half the story. This was because I didn't explain CC in the first txt.\n\nShe later apologized (in the car) by saying \"I'm sorry I'm being a dick but you only give me half the story\"\n\nWhen we got home I cried in the shower. When I got out she asked what was wrong and I told her she was being an asshole to me in the car. It became a big argument after. I told her I was upset with how she spoke to me and that her apology sucked. She said I give her attitude and blow up on her over 1 thing all the time but today 3 things irritate her (there was stupid incident over a blanket in the car too) and she can't have attitude? Also said \"I can't have an off day?\"\n\nShe also mentioned that I didn't tell her what time my mgr had asked me to clean and she thought it was a few minutes before my shift ended and not an hour.\n\nI understand being upset I was late getting out but the other stuff just seemed so dumb.\n\nShe isn't talking to be right now.\n\nTldr:  AITA for being upset that my gf had attitude with me the whole drive home for being late getting out of work and not explaining what CC means?",
