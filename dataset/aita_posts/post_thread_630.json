  "post content": "I have three kids, two boys aged 20 and 19, and a daughter aged 24. My ex husband is still very close with us and we remain basically best friends. \n\nWe all planned a vacation together to cape cod, but we sort of came to the conclusion that we shouldn't invite my daughter Laura. Laura... she can be a mean person. She is quick to anger and can be extremely demanding to others (especially aimed at her two brothers) and sometimes even just a night out to dinner with her can be hard to get through because of the way she acts. I just wanna give a quick example, we went to my cousins wedding and had to sleep over my sisters house the night before. My son had a blanket on the couch, and left it there while he went to go make breakfast. Laura, when she woke up, looked at the blanket, then asked him furiously \"are you going to fucking pick this up? You're just going to fucking leave this here like some slob? Pick it the fuck up\" at a volume that most of the people in the house could hear. My son doesn't even want to talk back to her for fear of escalating her anger, so he just did it. Another example is that my son left a pan in the sink to soak before washing it, and she flipped a shit and started calling him lazy and a brat and all this stuff. Over one pan. One time she asked my husband to do Yoga and he didn't want to, and she basically started berating him for being unhealthy and making his refusal to do yoga into this big thing. One time my son was having a migraine and had to cancel going to his aunts dinner, and Laura just absolutely berated him and insulted him for not 'sucking the pain up and going'. That is a microcosm of how she acts, not only to them, but to us as well, and her boyfriends and friends. If she finds even the slightest thing wrong with someone, she will point it out, viciously. \n\nShe can also be funny and charming and talkative! She isn't all bad. But she seems to have a problem when it comes to not being able to keep quiet over even slight things she finds annoying. \n\nWe want to have a fun vacation. But the thought of being with her for a week makes us all groan. It only takes one of her 'attacks' at us to really dampen the mood, especially when she starts insulting peoples characters and demeaning them. Me and my husband try to calm her down and tell her she's being irrational but there's no point at all, she just aims it at us and escalates further. \n\nSo we aren't telling her we're going. We're just gonna go. Are we the asshole for this? For basically abandoning our daughter to go on vacation without her? She would 100% be excited to go if we asked her, and she only lives 2 hours away from where we're going (we live in nyc, she lives in providence (but spends half her year in nyc). It sucks, because I do love her, but I also don't want to ruin a family vacation. I keep thinking how much fun it'll be to go with just the boys, and how awful it will be to go with her... but also how bad it is to not invite my own daughter.",

Maybe I\u2019m ignorant but this seems almost entirely like a combination of a parenting fault and a character flaw. She seems overly aggressive, nit picky and just overall bratty, but this I would assume would stem from attitude. Where does mental illness come from? Seriously, again I\u2019m being genuine and skeptical, not confrontational but where in OPs post is there context that implies mental illness more than general character flaws and parenting mistakes which makes sense. Often times it\u2019s the simplest or most common solution instead of the more intricate, more rare answer.\n\nI really don\u2019t mean to discredit any suggestion that sure a mental illness could be on the table, anything\u2019s possible.

I swear there\u2019s a word for this in medical diagnoses where it\u2019s assumed to be s common disease before it\u2019s something more serious or more rare. \n\nI only really comment on this because I see this on reddit all the time where the more unlikely or the more catching solutions are thrown out before the more practical solution, which in this particular instance I imagine bad parenting, developing bad attitude, no reinforcement on negative behavior, are all more practical answers. Especially since context of OPs perspective supports each of these thoughts. Mental Illness isn\u2019t the first to jump to mind with attitude problems in my opinion. Character flaws jump to mind. And I\u2019m not going to theorize because I\u2019m no medical professional or psychologist but what mental illness would even be implied for the context above? Is narcissism considered a disorder? I feel it is at some point but that\u2019s a stretch. Anger management seems like a stretch too. \n\nAgain I really don\u2019t mean to write off mental illnesses I\u2019m just confused why this seems to be offered as a seemingly more likely cause before standard behavioral/parental/integral flaws credited to OP or her daughter. Just confused and curious is all.",

Basically, all therapy did for him is concrete the idea of \"I am who I am, take it or leave it\" into his head and it actually made him a lot less tolerant when things don't go the way he think they should.  He just leaves situations that \"trigger\" him and leaves the people around him questioning what they did wrong.  He isn't open to discussing it because he believes that anyone who wants to talk it out doesn't accept him for who he is and wants to change him, when in reality we just want to talk it out and find out what upset him so much.  Maybe it was a shitty therapist, I don't know, but I know my parents did everything they could try to to correct his behavior growing up and he still acts the same way, maybe even slightly worse, at 40.",

If something doesn't go the way he thinks it should, he can just get plain nasty.  It often starts with small, playful jabs, so it's like he thinks the playful spin he tries (and fails) to put on it makes it ok to berate people.  If someone defends themselves (even if they keep it in a light, playful manner) it just escalates, he loses his shit and often storms out like a kid having a temper tantrum (he's 40) and leaves.  He's ruined almost every major holiday (Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.  I'm from the US so I'm not referring to vacation when I say \"holiday\") for us this way.  My dad, brother and I don't typically let it get to us, but it really bothers my mom and she usually ends up crying over it and it just puts a damper on quality family time.  We got sick of it so we just stopped inviting him to small random gatherings we decide to have.  We don't exclude him for holidays, that seems cruel but we don't include him for the random gatherings.\n\nIt just stinks being around these people sometimes.  It doesn't mean you don't love them, but it's exhausting trying to keep up with their unrealistic expectations, especially when it's a vacation and you should be relaxing and enjoying yourself.

      "content": "I\u2019m going to go against the majority and say NTA. I see a lot of people saying these are learned behaviors and I disagree. I have a sister like Laura. She\u2019s mean and blows up at minor things every single day. She\u2019s been in therapy for years and my parents have done their best to try and help her see why what she\u2019s doing isn\u2019t fair. Growing up, they had hour long conversations with her every other day, but she remained cruel. And just like Laura, she was vivacious and friendly at first and people loved her. Then when they saw what she could be like (i.e. selfish) they would come to me and ask what was wrong. Much like your sons, I don\u2019t speak with my sister. When she is there I\u2019m civil but I don\u2019t engage with her more than polite small talk. I don\u2019t think you should punish your sons and yourself because of how Laura behaves. Should you tell her? Probably. Do I think you should? No. But I also get that not many people will understand where you\u2019re coming from because they haven\u2019t seen the true horror of someone who behaves this way. \n\nTherapy may not be helpful if you\u2019re not addressing the primary problem. To me, someone who is NOT a psychiatrist, I would look into personality disorders. Specifically Histrionic disorder (which is argued about whether it is a separate disorder) and borderline personality disorder. These both seem to fit what you\u2019ve described for Laura. I want to make clear Laura needs to be evaluated by a trained professional before you go throwing those labels around. And I also think it\u2019s important to note that personality disorders can be managed, but that they often describe an individual\u2019s personality and thus can\u2019t be changed. \n\nI wish you luck OP. I know what it\u2019s like to be in your son\u2019s position as a siblings but I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be in yours as a parent. My parents are hurt every day by my sister\u2019s selfishness and the realization she will never be a kind nor loving person to them.",

I'm not relieving your of parental blame either, her attitude is a product of her upbringing, be it something learned, or a condition that went un cared for. \n\nThat out of the way, I totally understand your not wanting to take her! Honestly, I wouldnt want to either, vacations are meant to be peaceful and enjoyed. \n\nThis is complicated, and for the reasons above I think you owe it to her to be honest about her attitude and the weight that is on you all because of it. She may be mad or unhappy, but if you dont help her fix it sopn, you'll always **deal** with her instead of just **love** her. \n\nMaybe the vacation would be the best time to do this.",

She\u2019s 24, they can\u2019t force her into therapy. Likely she\u2019ll get pissed and find any excuse except her shitty behavior as to why shes not invited. Personally I still think that she should be told they\u2019re going and why she cannot, however I don\u2019t think that will change anything.",
