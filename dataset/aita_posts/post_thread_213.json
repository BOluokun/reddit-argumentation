  "post content": "My (29f) dad passed away a few years ago. Both me and my sister where left his estate in his Will when he passed. Our dad changed his Will a couple of years before he passed away, removing our mom from it. Our parents were separated and in the middle of divorce proceedings when he died.\n\nMy mom had an affair, which resulted in the breakdown of their marriage about 10 years ago. Subsequently it caused a lot of heart break, arguments and hostility not just between themselves but also for me and my sister towards our mom. This has somewhat resolved as the years passed, my sister was amicable with mom, for me... Our relationship was pretty much back to normal (I struggle with hating on others and find it easier to resolve the issue and carry on).\n\nMy dad confided in me some of the details of the divorce, most of which I would have rather not known, but he had no one else to speak with regarding it I suppose. Basically it did not paint my mom in the best light and honestly the actions and behaviours I observed her displaying following their separation tallied up to this. Unreasonable demands made with regards to finances and basically wanting to take most of my dad's pension.\n\nFollowing his death when his Will was read to us we then discovered my mom had been written out of his Will. Our mom is wanting to take legal proceedings against us if we decide not to give her over half of the money he has left to us (she wants us to discuss via mediation). Our extended family who know some details about this issue appear divided as to what we do. Both myself and my sister believe she should not receive any of this money, however I feel guilty. But on the other hand her actions since his death and her apparent greed repulses me. I feel torn and worried that I am being an ass hole as I don't feel we should have to give her any of his estate.",

Your state law may ultimately be a deciding a factor since your parents weren't officially divorced yet.  \n\n Disinheriting a Spouse\n\nMost common law states use a concept known as \"elective share\" to ensure that a surviving spouse isn't entirely disinherited. A surviving spouse who does not receive anything from the deceased spouse\u2019s will can elect to take between one-third and one-half of the estate. Some states use a sliding scale approach and look to the number of years a couple was married to determine how much of the estate a surviving spouse can claim. In other words, the longer the marriage, the more property the surviving spouse gets.\n\nMost community property states don\u2019t have these spousal protection laws, because they provide for spouses during the course of the marriage \u2013 for example, by making income earned by one spouse the property of both spouses.\n\nCommunity property states are: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Common law states are all other states.",

IANAL but I\u2019ve worked in both divorce law and probate. 1) it\u2019s boilerplate language in divorce decrees that ex-spouses revoke any claim to each other\u2019s estates - I understand your parents were not totally divorced, but it was headed that direction. 2) your dad wrote her out of the will. \n\nHowever, in many states, it is assumed that the surviving spouse is entitled to the marital assets, and although your dad wrote her out of the will, she can likely challenge that as taking against the will, as is her right. \n\nSummary: call an attorney, ASAP. I don\u2019t see why she sees herself as entitled to anything, or why you should feel guilty about not forking over any cash. All of your parent\u2019s history excluded, the fact of the matter is that they were getting divorced, and your dad\u2019s intent was not to allow her stake in his estate. \n\nEdit: If he\u2019d left it to, say, siblings, would they feel like they should share with his soon-to-be-ex spouse? She\u2019s using the fact that she\u2019s your mother as some seriously twisted leverage. I also recognize that I\u2019ve over-simplified re: the divorce - I assume that they would have either come to an agreement about how to split the marital assets, or the court would have awarded her some sort of either a) settlement, b) alimony, or c) some combination thereof, but the fact that they have been separated for so long would have also been taken into consideration.
