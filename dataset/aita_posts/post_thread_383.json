  "post content": "My gf wants to host a game night, but one of her friends has a newborn(4weeks old). The parents want everyone to have their flu shots before they bring the kid over. Maybe it's because I(30yr M) grew up before flu shots were a thing, but I don't feel that I should be required to have a shot to hang out with them. If they are worried about their kid they should get a sitter and leave him at home.\n\nMy gf got pissed and said I was being unreasonable because the flu shot was inexpensive and you can easily get them at a CVS. I am all about vaccinations, but I am not a fan of being told I need to do something for someone else's peace of mind.\n\nEdit:\n\nQuick edit, that I thought was obvious. I am not going to go if the baby will be there, and I don't have my shot. I don't want to get a baby sick/possibly die. I may still be the A\\*\\*hole, but I am not heartless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI wanted to let everyone know that I got the flu shot, went to game night, and it was a lot of fun. Thanks everyone for weighing in; even though I ended up being the A-hole, good to know a few people agreed with me.",

I'm a little bit older than you and have got one every year that I can remember.\n\nAnd the vaccine is just as much for everyone else as it is for you.\n\nGet the fucking shot.",

They give you a checklist and I did not meet any of the criteria. None of the risk factors and none of the qualifiers. I consulted the pharmacist and they said then I don't need it. As in they won't give it to me. I am going to ask my GP next visit in 2 wks why not. Anyway one of the risk factors was proximity to infants. OP qualifies.\n\nEdit2: since this post inspired some discussion, I went back to the pharmacy and [took a photo of the criteria](https://imgur.com/a/LWIYk5y). I also asked the pharmacist WHO he recommends to get the vaccine. He was ESL but said, \"seniors and people who are vulnerable or working with vulnerable people\". That's the official line from retail pharmacy. I then went to the clinic and asked their head nurse. She said \"everyone should get it\". That's the medical point of view. I asked her about the form and she said that is how the province is positioning it but that the clinic is basically giving it to anyone who asks for it. She said the pharmacies are probably being scrutinized a bit more about giving them out.",

I think this thread has been well and truly decided as YTA so I wanted to add an edit to explain to a lot of commenters (and readers) about the influenza vaccine because one topic keeps popping up. \n\nPeople keep commenting with something along the lines of 'it only contains three strains and they are a best guess'. This is true. The vaccine contains 3 or 4 strains depending on which you get and they are decided by scientists from around the world based on data they have collected. To call this a guess is, however, not fair to those that do this.\n\nIf you get the flu and you are admitted to hospital your blood is sent for testing and the strain you are infected with will be indexed. The network of centres around the world that keep track of every circulating strain in every corner of the globe at all times throughout the year is a remarkable thing. This gives scientists up to date information on all strains circulating at all times at all locations.\n\nThis wealth of information is then used to decide on which strains to include in the vaccine. Because of the unpredictability of the flu virus they sometimes don't get it quite right and a strain not included will be doing the rounds during flu season.\n\nTHIS DOES NOT MEAN YOUR VACCINE IS USELESS. The strains you have been vaccinated against still exist. They are still circulating. they are still circulating enough that they chose to put them in the vaccine that means they are putting people in hospital.\n\nOn-top of this it may be a case that you got a circulating flu virus that knocks you out for a week. They couldn't put this in the vaccine because of limited resources. However if you had gotten one of the strains that was in the vaccine you may have ended up in hospital. If you get the flu after having the vaccine it doesn't mean the vaccine hasn't worked it just means flu is being a dick this year.\n\n\nEDIT OVER\n\nEDIT 2: 8 day old account and now i have gold silver and lots of upvotes. Thank you strangers.\n________________________________________\n\nYay flu season i get to talk about my research.\n\nSeriously though people are complacent about flu. We haven't had a really bad pandemic in a while but it can still be deadly to edit:(everyone, it can be deadly to everyone) the young and elderly whilst you just end up feeling like shit in a bed for a few days.\n\nThere are new strains in this years vaccine. If you got last years you won\u2019t have been vaccinated against all of this years.\n\nGet the vaccine if you intend to hang around with someone vulnerable that cannot have the vaccine. That is the whole point of vaccines. A subset of the population cannot be vaccinated for one reason or another and worse may be more prone to serious illness so the rest of the population works together to get vaccinated so the subset that cant never has to worry.",

If the flu infected you in those 2 weeks you would feel it, sure, but you body would fight it off significantly more quickly than if you hadn't had the vaccine.

But modern research shows it is most effective to give it to young healthy folks. In fact in a shortage they should be prioritized as their immunity protects the vulnerable elderly better than directly giving said elderly the vaccine. \n\nThe reason for this is because the flu has a very specific season and serial interval (how long it takes to infect the next person in line). So you can think of it like a board game where the flu has a limited number of turns before the game ends. It \"wants\" to infect as many people as possible, but can only move from person to person. So as far as the flu is concerned, the most valuable people on the board are the ones with a ton of connections to other people (e.g. school kids, young adults, people in public facing jobs) . If it gets them, it has a lot of chances to propagate next turn. If it ends up infecting some old folks who never leave the house, its options are limited. \n\nNow from our point of view, think of a game like Pandemic, or on PC, Sins of a Solar Empire or MOO4. If we protect the most well connected points in the game we're much better off. A lot of defense in a strategic location can protect dozens of other points down the line. Even if those points are more vulnerable or valuable, you'd be crazy not to fortify the choke point.\n\nIRL, young active people with many social interactions are the choke points for the flu. They also respond better to the vaccine, and are harder to infect than old folks. As such getting them vaccinated is critical if you want to confound the flu's gameplan and save lives.",
