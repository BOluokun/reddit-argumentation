  "post content": "I(23F) and Ray(24M) have been living together for 4 years. We bought a house when we were still in college I am a software developer and my work is productivity based and I usually work late afternoons till 3-4a.m. This is even mentioned because Ray\u2019s 3 best buddies LOVE coming to our house. They all say it\u2019s great for everyone. Their girlfriends are not upset they are loud at their place or out drunk at a bar and I really don\u2019t mind the ruckus as I blast Metallica and often scream while I code. I really don\u2019t mind that they have guys weekends at our house as long as Ray cleans up the mess afterwards which he does.\n\nThe four of them got really drunk a month ago and decided it was really the best idea to put on my make up. 500-600$ of skincare, eyeshadows, lipsticks.. just half used and with hair pieces in them. Insert me vomiting a little. After I tell them all off, everyone save for Kole(24M) agrees to split the cost and pay up for the damage. I take the cash and I look at Kole expectantly, the last one of the bunch. He says no way is he giving me 150$, I can screw myself for all he cares. Ray got in an argument with him and Kole stormed out like a little kid. Good riddance! Ray apologised profusely and said Kole will come around. I brushed it off and said I don\u2019t really need him to \u2018come around\u2019. He gotta apologise and pay for what he owes- until then I don\u2019t want him in my house. \n\nTwo weeks pass and Kole comes by which is a little strange because Ray is out. I let him in and he walks in the living room and tosses a pile of crumpled small bills on the couch. \u2018There, enjoy. I\u2019m sorry. I guess I am the only one that will question your pricing\u2019. I asked if he is accusing me of lying about the worth of my make up and he goes-\u2018 Accusing? I am telling you, no way is that crap worth all that much. It doesn\u2019t matter, I gave you the money and the apology- I don\u2019t wanna deal with this anymore\u2019\nI kicked him out, texted Ray Kole will enter our house over my dead body and went to do work.\n\nUltimately I ruined something beautiful. They tried once to stay at someone else\u2019s place and got the cops called for being loud (it\u2019s a apartment building). Now, somehow I am at fault. Kole has let Ray know he will apologise for real if I \u2018lift my ban\u2019 but oh my God, can you apologise because you were wrong and a a-hole. Kole\u2019s GF texted me as well, she started off nice but got sour at the end \u2018You promised you will let him off the hook if he pays up, he did, and you went back on your word. Arguably you are worse off than him. Can you not ruin a schedule that works well for everyone. Come on OP, stop trying to make a point, they\u2019ve all been friends for nearly twenty years\u2019. I am starting to wonder if I am too harsh. As I\u2019ve seen the phrase around here- is this the right hill to die on? AITA?\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\n-they are loud because they play video games and drink beer, they are not drunk every single weekend. I wanted to clarify because people seem to think they get very drunk every week\n\n-my make up is in a bathroom that everyone uses, I have used old lipstick and shadows to do their Halloween make up and we have used some cheap drug store make up for different games on get togethers. With that said, still unacceptable to go through my stuff without clearing it with me\n\n-I am willing to forgive it because the majority of them were apologetic and offered to immediately pay for the damage\n\n-Ray is upset with Kole and backed me up, however they are not gonna stop being friends because of this particular event. Each to their own here, I am not upset with Ray about that",

My skin is really sensitive and it\u2019s worth it for me to buy more expensive skin care products and make up. It\u2019s the difference between my skin feeling and looking awful and being able to feel more secure about my skin along with not having it cause rashes and stuff.\n\nThis dude didn\u2019t apologize, at least not in a genuine way.

And now he's in kind of a bind, because he's not allowed back into the house to look at her make-up supply to see the brands.  So he'd either need the self-awareness to ask Ray to look and tell him what the brands are, so Kole could look it up.  Or, probably more likely, he'd just look at what the cheapest stuff costs on Amazon or Walgreens or something and use that as his basis for how much her make-up \"should\" have cost.)",
