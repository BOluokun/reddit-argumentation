  "post content": "Hello all,\n\nPreface: My boyfriend and I will be moving into a nice Riverfront townhome with a Riverfront park we are so happy about. We've been scouting this neighborhood for years and finally found a sale that was worth the price!\n\nFor about 4 years now, my sister has been living with my boyfriend and I. She doesn't have a job that makes enough money to fund everything she wants in life. So my boyfriend and I helped her out by having her stay with us at various places we've rented those past years and saved her tens of thousands. Now that we actually own a place, I told her she can stay. But I gave her some rules below as since we finally OWN a place, we want her to treat the place with a basic respect. \n\n1.) Her cat must have her claws capped at all times. Her cat isn't declawed understandably, and has already put small holes in some of mine and my boyfriends clothes, our nice mattress, and some furniture. \n\nEdit: I didn't know caps were cruel as well. My sister will just have to clip nails regularly as well as be accepting to assume full professional repair or replacement of all clothing, furniture, carpet, rugs, etc when damaged. My sister already has scratching posts she sprays with a cat nip spray. So all the midigation suggestions have been done. She'll just have to eat all costs, which will be expensive. \n\n2.) She will have to pay rent of $400/mo. She was upset because I told her she could live rent free years ago if we ever bought a place. But I want her to be helping out too now. I can understand her being upset, but this is a tiny amount to pay in a nice house in a nice neighborhood in a walkable community by the river. \n\nEdit for clarity: A one bedroom one bath at an apartment complex two blocks down is almost $2k/mo for lease on the cheapest unit. \n\n3.) No more pets. She has a dog and cat already. She's upset because she wants more cats and dogs and even more upset that I'm not letting her adopt more when my SO and I will be adopting our first and only dog. Or plan to in the future when we're settled. \n\n4.) Any dishes she dirtiest must be cleaned immediately after eating or put in the dishwasher immediately. She would pile dishes in the sink all the time. But we want a spotless sink now. My SO and I always cleaned our dishes right after eating and want her to do the same. This goes for her stopping leaving boxes and stuff on countertops. \n\nEdit: I do agree that this should be changed to maybe any dirty dishes made are cleaned by end of day. Not caring about the rare dish left overnight, but more setting the idea that one has to cleanup after themself. \n\n5.) Her room would have to be at least mildly clean. She'd always throw clothes and stuff on the ground and even her closet floor had 100% coverage of clothes. That wouldn't fly anymore and she'd have to be at least somewhat clean. I'm not asking for perfect but at least show respect to the place. \n\nEdit: This is the most brought up one and I get why people do. And again, I'm not asking for spotless. Just not asking for someone to live in a situation to justify a breeding ground for pests. I'm not asking for spotless, again, but you should clean up after yourself and not make a mess. That's a reasonable basic decency bare minimum expectation of any adult. And my sister is 26. \n\n6.) More rules can come up because we've never owned a place and some other thing could be thought of. \n\nEdit: I agree this rule is unfair and I should have an agreement written up in-full prior. \n\nShe was upset with every single point and thinks I'm being way too controlling. I genuinely don't feel that way. Especially because her staying here for super cheap is a courtesy, and I feel she's acting like it's an entitlement. \n\nAITA for setting these rules? Are they unreasonable?",

If you're going to make her pay rent, then you should give her reasonably free reign over her room.  I'm not saying you should allow her to store dirty dishes in there or anything that would attract insects, but if it's just clothes on the floor, let it go.\n\n6)  Don't make stuff up on the fly.  Come up with a lease.  Especially if you're going to be making her pay rent.",

I also made decent money bartending part-time so when mine has tight my niece's freshman year (she got land after that), I volunteered to bump my rent form $500 to $700 and to take over the cable bill. We both bought groceries and if I bought food when I was out, I always brought her something home. My niece too when she was home.

There's carpet, cardboard, and sisal rope types, as well as free standing and flat ones, and all sorts of different cute designs. Getting the cat some different ones will give them variety and you can find out what they like the best. Redirect any scratching to the posts or boxes, don't yell or spray the cat, and they will figure it out. You can also spray scratching posts with catnip.",
