  "post content": "I'll try to keep this short.\n\nSo, about 3 months ago, my brother (we'll call him F) became vegan. Cool, cool, idc. The past occurrence I am mentioning happened bc he went vegan.\n\nBasically, my BIG fam was getting pizzas & all 5 of them got a pizza they really, really wanted (including my vegan brother's personal vegan pizza no one else could eat) BUT me & my youngest sis, let's call her Q. We wanted a pizza the 2 of us could split but told no bc we had our \"pizza budget\" (5 pizzas) filled already. 1 was F's, 2 were my dad's & older brother's, & 2 were my mom's & other sis's. Me & Q do not fancy the other pizzas.\n\nSo, when I asked why F got a personal pizza, the pizza that used to be reserved for Q's & I's preference, but only Q & I had to sacrifice, I was told \"it was F's lifestyle, we have to make accommodations\". I was like, fine, ok, but why can't we take one of your pizzas & make it mine & Q's. My mom got upset saying that we \"like\" the other pizzas enough & we were all sacrificing other things so we could suck it up.\n\nNeedless to say, Q & I don't get pizza w/ the fam anymore & end up having to eat something else when they get pizza.\n\nNow, our ACTUAL MONEY budget is tightening so we can pay off the mortgage & car loan in 5 yrs. Yay, fine, awesome. But IK that this means my skincare & shampoo will most likely be nixed while F still gets his specialty vegan food that he doesn't even want but my mom makes him eat for \"a balanced diet\". Me & Q love doing skincare together & my special shampoos & body wash only cost $2-3 more than the rest of the fam's, a contrast to F's \\~$5-10 diffs on stuff he lets go bad. Mine & Q's skincare is only a \\~$15-18 charge every 3 months.\n\nHere's the issue: Me & Q see \"advanced\" skincare as a lifestyle. So, Im planning that win my mom comes to me saying I cant buy my shampoos or skincare bc of the budget, I'll say that if we have to sacrifice for F's lifestyle, the rest of them can sacrifice for mine & Q's lifestyle. IK this can be really petty, but Ive been sacrificing SO much lately for the sake of a budget & for my fam's lifestyles, I dont want to have to sacrifice my bonding time w/ my sis (& better hair & skin) while others, mainly F, get stuff they dont use most of the time that costs more (for example, my older brother spends a shit ton of money on his laundry bc he likes his products better & my mom spends money on clothes). Ik they wont have to sacrifice as much, either, bc Im outside the social circle that is my fam & they think my \"extras\" arent as important as theirs.\n\nIm more than willing to spend MY OWN money on my shampoos & bodywash, but NOT on my skincare bc that's for Q & I, & its less than others' \"lifestyles\" since it's less anyway but also split bw 2 ppl.\n\nTL/DR: I & Q sacrifice for my fam's lifestyle, so Im planning to throw that in their faces concerning budget cuts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/hungry\\_fatty/comments/le0g2v/update\\_wibta\\_if\\_i\\_use\\_one\\_past\\_occurrence\\_as\\_fuel/](https://www.reddit.com/user/hungry_fatty/comments/le0g2v/update_wibta_if_i_use_one_past_occurrence_as_fuel/)\n\nHey, so I actually just got a text after replying to most of y'alls comments. I agree w/ most of y'all  WBTA, but as I say in my update, ig in hindsight that was my plan, to be a petty asshole since Q & I didn't get pizza.  If the situation progresses & I am faced w/ this situation, I will prolly not use this argument, sooooooo, thanks :)",
