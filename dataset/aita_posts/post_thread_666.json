  "post content": "TL;DR Co-worker gets annoyed with a running joke I make.\n\nI (21NB) work as a cashier at a supermarket. My manager (27F) says Jesus Christ whenever she gets frustrated and after a few weeks of that I started responding with, \"Where!?\" I make a show of it, open my eyes really wide, look around quickly. She gets a kick out of it and it's sort of our thing now. I do the same with other co-workers and managers but my one co-worker (17F) got annoyed with it and I guess it's been building up for a while since she finally snapped at me the other day. She said, \"Stop doing that, that's so annoying.\" I responded with, \"OK, Sorry. I won't do it with you.\" She says, \"No. Stop doing it period. I can hear you every time you do it and it's super annoying.\" I backed away from her after that and only planned on not doing it with her but now that I've had time to think, maybe I should stop doing it all together. AITA?\n\nUpdate:I don't know how other people update their posts so I'm just gonna do it like this.\n\nSo the general vote was everyone sucks. I suck for repeating the joke and she sucks for being rude about it. I'll take others' advice and change it up a bit. Side note, the manager that I originated the joke with quit for medical purposes. Guess she really did get sick of the joke . . . In all seriousness, thank you for the feedback, and thank you for the advice. Seeing as the issue is resolved I probably won't be returning to this post.",

She may be the only one saying something, and she is saying it rather rudely, but I doubt she is the only one thinking this way.\n\nMy vote is ESH, though as far as these threads go its a pretty low grade of asshole here.",
