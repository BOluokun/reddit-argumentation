  "post content": "Dating two years, moved in together 6 months ago. As a single guy, I had piles of laundry, dishes, papers, etc but always got to cleaning them up on my first day off. Now it\u2019s like a competition between the two of us as to how long before one of us is repulsed enough to do something. Here\u2019s our situation:\n\nMe: I make twice as much money as her, so I pay for every bill for the household (rent, gas, electric, internet, etc.) and food every other week. I work 12 hour days 4 days per week with 3 day weekends.\n\nHer: makes very little money plus has some debt from college and bad decisions. Pays for food every other week. Works 30 hours/week, but usually only has 1 day off. Lots of split shifts and half days. Also taking online classes for a certificate. \n\nChores: We usually work together cooking the meals for the week ahead of time. The dishes are usually piled up until the next week when we need to cook again. I use the same 3 containers taking food to work for 4 days, usually paper plates and a water bottle and beer cans on my weekend. She comes home for lunch, leaves cups of soda out each night. What I\u2019m saying is I think she makes more dishes.\n\nChores (cont.): She does laundry almost every day. She has required outfits for each day that definitely cannot go 2 days without washing. She throws my clothes in with hers because it doesn\u2019t make much sense to wash just her outfit alone each day.\n\nChores that pile up: trash is overflowing before someone takes it out. Dishes pile up. No sweeping, dusting, or mopping so far except once for her family\u2019s Christmas at our house and I did it today. Bathroom is never cleaned.\n\n\nTL;DR- Am I the asshole for expecting the person who doesn\u2019t contribute financially (and probably makes more messes) to help around the house more though I have more free time.\n\nEdit: Wow quick responses. Mostly we both suck, with me being the asshole for having an archaic idea of the provider/housewife bullshit. Guess it\u2019s time for an adult conversation. Thanks guys.",

      "content": "YTA-\n\nPretty typical issue a couple can have, but a few notes on your specific situation.\n\n1) Almost every single human being on earth, when making the assessment, comes to the conclusion that the OTHER person makes bigger/more messes, and often can easily overlook their own mess. (It\u2019s like not minding the smell of your own farts over others)\n\n2) You didn\u2019t mention specifically what \u2018bad decisions\u2019 led to her debt, and the things you did mention are reasonable. Take a second look and make sure that you aren\u2019t making a false comparison between your lives. Some people made the \u2018bad decision\u2019 to be born into a low income family, or not receive any help from parents that other people in a similar situation might receive when going off to college, etc. Not having a solid foundation at the start of adulthood can plunge you into debt really fast, without doing anything outright irresponsible.\n\n3) Would you be paying significantly less for any of your costs of living if you were completely single? I pay more rent and bills than my boyfriend because I make more. If we split, my bills would either stay the same or increase. He\u2019d probably have to rent a room on his income, so he\u2019s getting a bit of a boost here, but I\u2019m not actually losing anything.\n\n3) split shifts are very stressful and can zap personal time by splitting up the day. She may work less than you and make less, but I bet she feels like she\u2019s ALWAYS working. and keep in mind that people who get paid less per hour don\u2019t get less tired or drained per hour. She works 30 hours a week and goes to school, so she\u2019s as busy as you are.\n\nBottom line: you both have busy lives and enough stress that you feel some kind of mental block from keeping your place clean and organized. Then the blame game starts. \n\nTalk to her openly about how you feel you\u2019d both be happier if you came home every day to a clean and organized living space, and make chore assignments that fit both of your schedules.
