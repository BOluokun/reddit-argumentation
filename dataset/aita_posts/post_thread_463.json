I told my husband yesterday that I was worried that we only had 3 eggs left and he said he would go to the store and get more. Next morning, he wanted to tell me about this wonderful breakfast he made for himself (English muffin, 3 eggs and ham). Without thinking,  I\u2019m like \u201cthat\u2019s great babe, sounds good, glad you liked it\u201d meanwhile he is working all day. I get hungry finally and for the first time I can\u2019t wait for the eggs and rice. I open the fridge and the eggs are not where they usually reside in the fridge. \nMe: babe did you seriously eat all of the eggs \nHim: yeah I told you about my breakfast \nMe: I told you that\u2019s the only meal I can eat right now and I was worried about the eggs running out! \nHim: oh sorry\nSo here I am maybe overly pissed off, but come on! \nAm I the A**hole for getting mad?",

How rude of him to finish off one of the only two things in the house OP can stomach. \n\nHope your morning sickness goes away soon, OP.  If you have a store within walking distance, I encourage you to get some fresh air and exercise.",

I would recommend looking into grocery delivery services for yourself if they are available for times like these or curbside pickup. Also since you know what you can handle at this point stock up a lot. Get 3-4 dozen eggs and always make sure you keep a steady supply so you don't go hungry.",
