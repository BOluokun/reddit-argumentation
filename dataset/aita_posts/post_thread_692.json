  "post content": "My daughter is 5 years old and my mother has had full custody of her since she was four months old. Being a young teenage mom with no money, no car, no house, really no support was extremely difficult and I felt the most selfless thing I could do was to sign my rights over to my Mom. Since then, I have way more stability in all areas of my life. Financially I contribute A LOT! I buy all her shoes (she has like 150 pairs not kidding) I buy all her clothes, I bought all the booka on her teacher's Amazon Wishlist.. I also create wonderful memories for her.. We fly kites, get our nails done, go to Barnes And Nobles, paint, etc. When we arent together I read several stories to her over Facetime and sing four or five songs every night that she always  falls alseep to. I love her very much! She is my pride and joy!\n\nIt is my character to bless others as I have been blessed! I taught my mother my legit totally legal side hustle and helped her generate 60k in passive income this year. My family tries to rip me off any chance they get! My little brother just stole $15,000 from me and I just have to suck it up and smile because if not, my mom wont let me see my princess. Period.\n\nMy aunt has been estranged from my Mom the last ten years because she is an extremely vane, manic, botox Queen who will do nice things for someone then demand the money back. (10 yrs ago she bought my mom wooden floors after my parents divorced then demanded repayment.) Eventually they made up and talk on the phone like 8 to 10 times a day.  A couple times I have heard her say really rude things about me. The first time was when they were on the phone in the car and I was riding passengar. They were talking about their brothers exwife who starts with a T. (and so do I) She kept saying over and over, THERE IS NOBODYYYY I want to talk w that starts with a T. Like hmm ok.\n\nThis weekend my daughter spent the night w me and now Im doing laundry I noticed this old pilled up pajama dress that says \"DRAMA QUEEN (like my mama)\" I remember my mom said she bought it for my daughter used off Poshmark. It is really tacky looking and nothing like she would normally buy. I feel it was a joke on me. WIBTA to say something to her?",

Your familial relationship with money on all counts is abnormal. Your mother threatening to keep your daughter from you is weird, and you not regaining custody once financially stable is weird. Pajamas are the least of your issues",

Amazon had these really nice knock off Converse that are super comfortable and affordable with a wide color variety. They were selling out quickly so I kinda splurged bc I was afraid they wouldnt restock. I recently went to try and find that same shoe again and theyre history!! The whole listing is a different shoe. So no regrets on the 150 shoes truly.\n\nShe says she has 2 mommies.",

Your kid doesn\u2019t need 150 pairs of shoes, your little bro should be made to repay the $15,000 he stole, your mom shouldn\u2019t stop you from seeing your child and there\u2019s nothing wrong with used clothes. \n\nIt\u2019s petty that you want to get a shirt that says \u201cGod doesn\u2019t like ugly\u201d in retaliation for a pyjama dress that says \u201cdrama queen\u201d. It\u2019s also really petty that your aunt demands money after giving gifts (they\u2019re not gifts if she wants paying for them) and doesn\u2019t want to talk to anyone whose name starts with T. You can confront your mom about the pyjama dress that says \u201cdrama queen\u201d on the front but what\u2019s the point? If your mom is petty enough to stop you from seeing your kid over $15,000 that\u2019s rightfully yours, then there sure ain\u2019t nothing stopping her from doing the same thing over a pyjama dress. \n\nDoes your kid call you \u201cmom\u201d, or call your mom \u201cmom\u201d? Either way it doesn\u2019t matter. Kids clothes with statements like that are supposed to be light hearted, fun jokes. \n\nStop teaching your mom totally legal side hustles when she won\u2019t let you see your child if you ask your little brother for the $15,000 he stole. Your family are all toxic and have no loyalty to you at all. I\u2019m no lawyer but I\u2019m sure your mom can\u2019t stop you from seeing your child, it\u2019s not illegal to buy a kid a pyjama dress that says \u201cdrama queen like my mama\u201d and I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s illegal for your brother to steal money from you.\n\nCut your mom off for encouraging your brother\u2019s theft. Cut your brother off for theft. Cut your aunt off for saying rude things about you and seek legal advice over getting custody of your daughter seeing as how your better off financially now.\n\nAlso, the title of the post says that your post says your aunt put your kid in the pyjama dress but the body of the text says that it was your mom. Who was it, I\u2019m confused?",
