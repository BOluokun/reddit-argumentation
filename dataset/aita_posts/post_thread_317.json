  "post content": "My sons 10th birthday is next saturday and me and my husband have been planned a party for him. To make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and I had my son pass them out Friday. We invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). Except for one child well call david. \n\nThe school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a \"normal\" class once a week. David is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. From what I know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and I have nothing against either of them. However, there have been incidents with david before. Last year through friends I had heard that David had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. I don't know if I believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. There are other logistical problems as well (The party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end I decided to not invite david. \n\nWell, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. This got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. She told me that I am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. When I brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. I woke up this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding with her. \n\nI just want my son to have a good party and didn't mean anything by this. AITA?",

But you could have spoken to his parents beforehand about the environment and potential ways to mitigate that; you could have spoken to your son's teacher to see if s/he has advice for how David is in group situations. You don't even know how his behavior may have improved over the past year specifically because of being included socially. This would have been a good chance to teach your son to include people, and instead you taught him it's okay to exclude someone if their disability makes your fun time slightly more difficult.",

No birthday invitations (sound familiar!?), no playdates, no inclusive anything that was even remotely inconvenient.\n\nI am so SO glad I left that cesspool of pretentious hypocrites and transferred my son into a PUBLIC school. Much more accepting, warm and honest. Lots of invitations, new friends etc.\n\nWhat a sad world we live in.",

Inside it said something along the lines  \u201cI know he may get overwhelmed, but maybe if you came a little early before everyone arrived they could have some fun playtime that would be less stimulating. I want to make this work for you guys.\u201d And that mother said she was in tears, and that her son never got invited to parties and that this was such a kind act. Not inviting him is bad enough, but to pass out invitations in front of him while he knows he is being purposefully excluded breaks my heart for that kid.",

When her teacher went up to give the awards she reminded the students and parents to please be quiet as some of these students do not like loud noises and to not applaud. So when the students started getting their names called, unprompted the audience begins doing the silent clap which is used for people with hearing problems. The auditorium was full of first grade students and it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop, but they were all showing immense respect by silently clapping. I almost cried at that moment and I still tear up when I think about it. So, I give the kids at my daughter\u2019s school a lot of credit, they have been nothing but inclusive with my daughter.",
