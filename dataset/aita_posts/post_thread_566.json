My mom calls dad and was apparently scared I had gotten lost because she and my brother couldn't find me (where I think I'm the A-hole). My dad told here I was with him and she then had a go at me other the phone , then the call ended. They came over to get their things and had a go at me , my dad Tried sticking up for me but then they ignored him.  when I tried sticking up for myself my mom says \"How deaf do you think I am\" and then says \"huh\" when I try responding with \"Not at all\" , Reddit , AITA?",
