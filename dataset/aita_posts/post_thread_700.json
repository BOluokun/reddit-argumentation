  "post content": "This is something that just came to light last night, im on mobile and I'm still pissed so please excuse any grammar errors.\n\nI have been with my BF \"Dean\" for over a year and a half. He is everything to me and I'm everything to him. He helped me gain the courage to get mental help and to straighten myself out, become less of a doormat, etc. I see myself possibly and more than likely being with him for the rest of my life and he feels the same.\n\nMy brother, \"Roger\" and his wife, \"Emma\" are already married but her and her family wanted a big wedding which they are doing this next year in the summer.\n\nI called my mom like usual after work since she lives in another state and she keeps me sane while driving home. Due to the weather this last weekend I couldn't make it up to her place for Christmas as it is a 5 and a half hour drive for me. But my two brothers and their SOs are there.\n\nShe told me that Emma was trying to not invite Dean to the wedding since we aren't married, aren't fianc\u00e9s, and apparently aren't living together? We are and have been living together for a while. But these same parameters don't go for my other brother and his GF. My father caught wind of it and he too said that Dean was going if he could and she would be wrong to not invite him. My mother told Emma and Roger that if Dean was not invited, she wouldn't go and that she wasn't going to be paying for the rehearsal dinner.\n\nWhen I heard it from my mom, I did say some choice words that I'm not too proud of but I was angry. Like I said, I support my brother fully but she has changed him. We all three bonded (brothers and I) over a shitty divorce and a sucky upbringing and now he doesn't even call me once in a while like he used to. It feels like I'm losing my brother, but I suck it up because he seems happy and I want him to be happy.\n\nI told Dean and he now doesn't want to go even though my mom smoothed it over and made sure he was invited.\n\nNow onto the issue, no one but my mom knows that me and Dean know about the uninvited to invited issue. I dont think I can bring myself to be civil at our Christmas celebration this weekend at my Dad's place. I know Dean won't pretend he doesn't know, but I honestly don't know if I should bring it up at all. I want to, everytime I think about it my blood boils.\n\nI just want an apology, a heartfelt apology, but I know I'll never get one. I might still back out of going to the wedding over this, it will break my heart because my brother probably won't talk to me ever again if I dont go. But I can't just let this go.\n\nSo WIBTA if I were to basically cause a scene this weekend with my SIL? I'm fully prepared for the fallout but I don't want to ruin our Christmas celebration especially since this is the first time in a long while all the \"kids\"(us) are together in one place again. I know I shouldn't be a doormat about this but I feel like I'd just make everything worse.",

You have no idea what's actually going on behind the scenes and this whole \"Emma's rules...\" may not even be hers.  You're more likely to get a real conversation and an answer from your brother.\n\nYour mum was right to say they aren't helping pay if your boyfriend isn't invited.  Leave it at that.  They made a bad decision that excludes someone who is, clearly, considered part of the family.  It got fixed.\n\nIf you confront her and only her (as if it isn't two people's wedding) it becomes a clown to clown conversation.  You even look worse because you caused the scene at Christmas.\n\n If you want to find out why it happened talk to your brother privately about it.  But I have noticed brides tend to get blamed a lot for the decisions the couple, or even the groom by himself, makes.",
