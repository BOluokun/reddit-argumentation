  "post content": "My brother after 5 years of university moved back with us until he begins his military duty, so he is staying here for 4 months. He is living in the same room as I do. But this is my last year of high school, that means much time on studying...His sleeping schedule is terrible. He sleeps multiple times the day and not sleeping at night. He sleeps at least 4 hours at the \"no-sleep-time zone\". The problem is that I am studying at the same room and I can't get the job done in a dark room and with someone snoring like crazy (he is snoring waaaaay too much). Most times I end up in the dinning table which isn't the most comfortable place to study, I am far from everything I need and the table is next to the kitchen that can easily provide with a variety of unpleasant sounds (people cooking, drinking water etc).  Both me and my parents had argued with my brother for this thing. Am I The A-hole?",
