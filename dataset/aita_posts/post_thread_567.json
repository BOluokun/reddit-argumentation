  "post content": "So my roommate likes to leave things on top of the shared fridge, like pasta, bread, and snacks. We have a fridge where the freezer is on top. She left for the weekend and was in a rush and apparently just shoved all her shit on top of the fridge/freezer. She must have left some stuff on the top of the closed door of the freezer. I woke up the morning after at like 5 am to get ready for school and opened the freezer, and her container of spaghetti came falling down along with her bread and bagels. Her container is [this one](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-POP-Container/dp/B000UHT0MM/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1MBTC3M17YD25&keywords=tall%2Boxo%2Bcontainers&qid=1548183589&sprefix=tall%2Boxo%2B%2Caps%2C290&sr=8-2&th=1) . It broke on the bottom, just a small hole on the corner, still usable lid and stuff just a busted bottom portion.\n\nI texted her after I did it letting her know that I broke it and she said it was fine. Today, about a week after it broke, she comes in my room and asks for money to replace the container. I was confused because she didn't seem too irritated by it before but she said the containers are expensive (they are, who the fuck pays $15 for a plastic bin and lid?) so I should pay her back.\n\nI said I don't think I should have to pay for it because she left the container in a precarious location and I didn't do anything wrong to have caused it to be broken. She said I should have checked the top of the freezer before opening it, but that's kind of ridiculous to think to do at 5 am and also I'm 5'2\" so I can't really see the top of the freezer anyway. I also said she could just tape the hole closed on the container and it would still be usable. So now she's off in a huff and called me a cheapskate. Honestly I'll give her the cash if I'm the asshole here but I legit think no one is really in the wrong here, so I shouldn't have to pay.\n\nAITA? \n\nTl;Dr: Roommate left her $15 pasta container on top of the freezer and it fell when I opened it. I don't think I should have to pay because she is the one who left it in a dangerous spot and the container is still usable with mild repair. AITA?\n\nEdit: I gave her $5 and she seems fine with that",
