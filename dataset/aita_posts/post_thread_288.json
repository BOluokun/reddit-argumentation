  "post content": "My in-laws are what you would call traditional. They seem to think the world should have stopped 50 years ago, and think everthing since then is evil. They aren't racist (that I know of) or outwardly bigoted, but they just are very old fashioned. \n\nMy husband and I have three children (16f, 14f, 10m) and we go to visit all their grandparents since they live close. Here's the issue, they don't like the idea of women wearing pants. My MIL says it's \"showing off\" and my FIL always says it isn't christian. Now I'm pretty feminine, so I don't mind throwing on a dress when we stop by, but our daughters are not.\n\nThey don't like visiting my husbands parents, which breaks his heart, because we make them put on a dress before they go. They are both pretty tomboyish, and they never wear any dresses otherwise. I had to but each of them a few dresses specifically so they can go. To be clear it's not like they aren't allowed over if they wear pants, it's just that they won't shut up the entire time about how much they hate it.\n\nOur daughters hate this, and think it's unfair. I guess it is, but in a lot of cultures women only wear skirts and dresses so I don't think it's a big deal. Plus it isn't like it hurts them to wear a dress a few times a week for a few hours. The issue is our oldest is planning to never speak to her grandparents again after she's 18, and I'm worried it's affecting them.",

This is exactly what OP *SHOULD* be doing for her daughters.\n\nInstead, OP is allowing her in-laws to bully her daughters and not sticking up for them and their needs in order to avoid conflict or awkwardness with her in-laws. She is invalidating her children's feelings of discomfort, especially if they NEVER wear dresses to the point where she had to buy ones specifically to go to the in-laws house and are upset enough over it to go no contact with the grandparents at 18. There is a larger issue here. It isn't JUST a dress to them. \n\nOP is an adult and should be putting her in-laws in their place. They have no right to dictate what her children wear and she is showing her children that her in-laws wishes and avoiding conflict matter more to her than their discomfort.  She is also teaching them that they should be expected to be ok being uncomfortable and unhappy to appease others because... *(checks notes)* they are girls... As if society is not going to tell them enough that they are expected to change themselves or reduce themselves to make others (mostly men) happy.\n\nThese are lifelong damaging messages you are sending to your daughters OP.

But they lived in the area where our family started out in the US in the 1700s, so there were a LOT of relatives to interact with when we were down there. \n\nI remember my dad shaving off his beard before a trip down there, because beards were apparently frowned upon at the time. Maybe they still are, idk. One of my dad\u2019s cousins worked for a beer company and would hook my grandpa up with her freebies from work. This was scandalous, both her working for an evil alcohol company and him having the odd cold beer. He was in his NINETIES at the time, ffs.

There was always something they were picking at or criticizing. On the rare occasions I did see them as an adult, they criticized how little I visited the entire time, which in turn made me want to see them even less.\n\nI also had a lot of resentment toward the parent who never stood up for me with them and subjected me to all of their criticism.

Sit down and have a conversation about what they want their relationship with their grandparents to be. I\u2019m not saying never see them, but you may need to cut back, or your partner may need to have a difficult conversation with your ILs, or you and your daughters may need to find a compromise (like leggings under dresses) and you shut down any discussion of their clothes during visits.\n\nSome food for thought: I know there are some people who just really hate wearing dresses that much. But if your kids actually enjoyed spending time with your ILs outside of the dress thing, I don\u2019t think this would be such an issue.

Katherine Hepburn would be in black and white movies wearing pants. By the 50s they were standard attire for women. That is 70 years ago! If they are in their 80s they were choosing their own fashion standards in an era when women wearing pants was normalised.\n\nJust to add that it has nothing to do with fashion for the culture. They have decided something is or isn't acceptable likely contrary to the culture they grew up in. And now their grandkids are being forced to change their clothes to accommodate their opinions. That's controlling \n\nGreat they like women in dresses, then they can wear dresses. But they are dictating something that isn't part of the culture, to their own standards and everyone is accommodating because they don't want to upset them. Why?\n\nIs grandma going to make a fuss? Plenty of traditional values would think a woman shouldnt be so mouthy. is grandad going to make a fuss, plenty of 'traditional' values would say he is 'a bit funny' for caring so much about women's clothing. Or do they just get to pick what traditional values to comply with and everyone else has to make do?\n\nKeeping the peace may be the cost you like to pay, but you have almost adult children saying 'hey, that cost/benefit equation does stack up for me.' I would think raising women OP want them to be in a position where they have the bodily autonomy and confidence to be able to say no to people making demands on how they live their life. Or they are raising daughters who are more likely to change their lives around a controlling partner. Don't normalise women living smaller lives to make others feel more comfortable, there is enough of that already and it leads to heartbreak.\n\nAnd to add to that history of women: couldn't get a mortgage without a male relative signing off until the 70s, couldn't legally drink at the bar until the 80s in the UK. Traditional values are far too often handcuffs on women's wrists, put there on men, and then socially reinforced by women because it's 'virtuous'.",

There's a difference between \"please don't wear jeans at your cousin's wedding\" and \"we are going to let closed-minded misogynists dictate what you should wear on an almost daily basis because *their* values are more important than *YOUR* autonomy.\" What some people seem to be missing is that this isn't about a dress code, it's about some pretty antiquated gender issues and there are a lot of additional messages in that.\n\nOP, if you think your kids are only being alienated by their grandparents you're kidding yourself. You've sent a very clear message that any gender equality they feel at school/ around friends away from the in-laws is ultimately meaningless because when it comes down to it, multiple times a week, every single week, ***it can be revoked*** at the whim of anyone else whose values and opinions you prioritize more.  You're prioritizing people who believe that your daughters are only as important as their ability to submissively please other people with their femininity and appearance. \n\nIf that sounds like a gross exaggeration that can't be true (\"no, grandma and grandpa care about them more than that!\") then surely gma and gpa would eventually be able to accept them in pants, no? \n\nIf not, then you already have your answer. What you need to realize is that either way, this is *already* the answer your kids see ***you*** enabling on a near-daily basis. You are not on the sidelines here OP. Your in-laws may be old fashioned, but you're the one teaching your kids that seeking your in-laws' approval is much more important to you than advocating for your kids.

Stand up for them and show them that they are the masters of their body! It's one thing to Dress appropriately for an occasion and the other thing to let make them wear something they hate regularly. You teach them it's okay for other people to decide over their bodies because they are girls, which is something you don't want. \nUs women, we have fought so hard for the right to choose our own clothing. Please do not allow mysoginst patriachy-people to steamroll over them.\n\nStand Up for your girls. Tell them they enjoy their visits significantly less because they are forced to wear something they don't feel comfortable in. Tell them you want them to like to come but constant nagging will shoo the Girls away.\n\nI really feel for your daughters.\nStory time. When I was little, I was all dresses and ponies and pretty things. When I hit puberty my style did a U-turn and for about five years I did not own one skirt or dress. Being the only Girl on my dad's Side my grandma and aunt could not get over how I prefered jeans and hoodies and such in the beginning and I hated every family occasion for it. But they got used to it after my parents were clear and firm about how my clothing was neat and clean and just normal stuff.\n Now I have both but skirts and dresses mostly for going out or summer. Those are not practical. No Pockets, you always have to think about how you sit and move and there is a lot of things you can't do in them. \nPlease free your girls.",
