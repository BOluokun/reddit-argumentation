It feels like what I say doesn't matter and that he's just waiting for me to stop talking.\nWe will be sitting down looking right at one another and I will be telling him about something (today was about issues I'm having with my doctor) and he will just not respond.\nNo \"wow that sucks\" \"damn\" \nNothing.\nThis is something I've spoken to him about a LOT. He just doesn't see anything wrong with it. \"Not everything needs a response\" \nAt this point we are on complete opposite sides with no one budging.\nHe thinks this is just how he is and I need to get over it.\nI think he needs to work on his behavior because it should be an easy enough change for him to make and its something that HURTS me.\nSo AITA for Making this a problem and starting a fight?",
