  "post content": "\n\n\nSo my M27 car broke down, I asked my wife F26 to give me a ride to work in her car that I helped save up for and she agreed. \n\nShe's the type of driver that makes a mess in the car. Emoty perfume bottles, makeup stuff, empty cartoons and plastic bags and old airfreshners are all in the back. When I got to her car and opened the passenger door. I found her bag lying there. I asked her to remove it so I could sit but refused and said that the bag \"has\" essential \"stuff\" inside that she needs immediate access too like her lipstick or gum pack. I was stunned when she pointed to the back and told me to sit in there. I said no, because the back was a mess and also, out of respect I should be sitting in the passenger seat where passengers should sit. She insisted but I refused and asked her repeatedly to remove her bag. She didn't so I went ahead and get in and sat on it. She freaked out on me yelling about it then an argument ensued. She removed it, put it in the back then started yelling about how I was disrespecting her in her own car and that she was doing me a FAVOR by giving me a ride to work, and shold've just sucked it up and shown some respect. I ended up taking the bus and she was mad because she claimed I damaged her makeup pallette that was inside the bag. She called me immature and said that I don't get to control and disrespect her and the things she owns.\n\n\nWe haven't talked since I got home. AITA for sitting on her bag?",
