  "post content": "I (24/F) love baking, and I LOVE sharing my baked goods too. I generally get along with everyone else in the office except for this one guy (36/M) , which I will call Leo (not real name) whom I wasn't on very good terms with because of the events that happened years ago when I first joined the company years ago as a fresh graduate. \n\nLeo complained that I am \"lazy\", hates \"cleaning up after my mistakes\" and I made him \"vomit blood\". I did ask him for mentoring help to generate the reports in the way he expects but he didn't want to. Instead he asked me to look at his report and \"follow his style\". Fortunately I was redeployed to another role by in the same department with a better mentor. We don't talk to each other since.\n\nMy birthday fell on a Sunday. I decided to bake cupcakes for everyone in the office as form of celebration, to be given on Friday of that week. \n\nI considered baking one for him but decided against it because of how tried to share food but was rejected. I believed that even if I made him the cupcake, he would turn it down in way way which will make me \"loss face\" in front of everyone in the office. \n\nFor practical reasons too, I decided to make 24 cupcakes (only have a 12 hole cupcake tray) there would be only 2 rounds of baking. There was 25 people in the office excluding me.\n\nSo on Friday, I came into office with a box of cupcakes, which took me the whole night to bake and I also woke up early to put the frosting in. \n\nRight after lunch, I went from table to table offering my colleagues a cupcake each and everyone was appreciative of it. When I reached Leo's table, I tried offering it to him. As expected, he said no, but in manner I find to be pretty respectful.\n\nAfter distributing the cupcakes, one of my colleague came up to me and asked for the extra cupcake that Leo rejected. I told my colleague I actually baked just enough for the office, excluding Leo, so there was no extra cupcake. My colleague looks shocked so I told her that baking the cupcakes didn't come cheap and since Leo was going to reject it anyway, I didn't bake more. I also told her about the limits of my oven and I just simply didn't have enough time to do three rounds of baking only to be turned down at the end.\n\nWhen I came back on Monday, word has apparently spread to everyone in my department how Leo didn't \"get\" a cupcake and I left him out him intentionally. Leo didn't say anything to me about the cupcake thing but I was told by a colleague that he was really upset and he \"really loved cupcakes\", and would have \"came around if I had just left some in the fridge and leave him alone to get it\". \n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for baking 24 cupcakes instead of more? I mean I could do just one more round in the oven with ONE or two more cupcakes but it would be a waste of electricity and my time.",

It is mentioned in the post, as well as the commentary, about the cost of making the cupcakes. Cupcakes are not expensive to make at all. A batch of 24 costs around $6-7 (including buttercream frosting, cute cups, and energy use). That 24 can be stretched to 25 and nobody would ever notice or mention how their cupcake felt slightly smaller than cupcakes they've had in the past. It doesn't cost anything more to make that 24 batch into a 25 batch. \n\nMaking 24 was an AH move. Always make enough for everyone, even ones you don't like. We learned that in grade school. When you got caught you took the opportunity and tried to blame Leo. That's not cool OP. He was minding his own business on this one. This office drama was absolutely started by you.

That's not an unreasonable amount of time and a little bit less out of each one wouldn't make a difference in how they tasted. Hell, make 30 if you dont want to feel like the extra one was specifically made for him. OP went out of her way to exclude Leo and used the opportunity to broadcast it to the office. Even if he chose not to take a cupcake, out of 23 other people, someone would have eaten 2 or taken one home to their SO or kid. Extras wouldn't have gone to waste. YTA",

Saying, \u201csorry, the cupcakes are all gone\u201d, is much better than a long winded explanation of why you don\u2019t think one of your colleagues is worth making a cupcake for.  You are just digging the hole deeper by explaining what the cupcakes cost. In most workplaces, there will be people you don\u2019t like. You usually have to find a way to get along well enough to work together. Instead you made treats for every person except one & then made a point of explaining why. That behavior wouldn\u2019t be tolerated in a child\u2019s school classroom. \n\nBut since you brought up the ingredients, why didn\u2019t you just put a little bit less in every cupcake holder so you could make 25 cupcakes instead of 24? True, it\u2019s one more round of baking (15 minutes?) but that\u2019s better than having the whole office talking about you & Leo.",
