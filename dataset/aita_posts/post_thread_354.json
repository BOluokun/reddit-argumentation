  "post content": "We\u2019ve been dating for about 4 months and mostly it\u2019s been good. He\u2019s cute, smart, and very successful. The only downside is that he\u2019s almost addicted to buying things that are on sale or have coupons despite being a VP at his company. I\u2019m not talking about sometimes or even most of the time, I would be alright with that. He never buys anything at full price. NEVER!\n\nHe plans his cooking around what\u2019s on sale that week at the grocery stores. All of his clothes were bought on sale or clearance, even his socks and boxers. Last week we were at my friend\u2019s house for dinner and she commented on his shirt. He proudly said he got it on clearance last year for $20. I was mortified. Lastly, we don\u2019t go to any restaurant unless he finds a coupon or they\u2019re running some kind of special.\n\nThings came to ahead last night when we went out to dinner. He had a digital coupon for buy one get one free. For some reason, the restaurant\u2019s computer didn\u2019t recognize the deal and the poor cashier couldn\u2019t make it work. We were holding up the crowded line because he refused to pay for both dinners. Finally the cashier called the manager but he was busy somewhere else in the restaurant. While we waited, the people behind us were getting annoyed. I was so embarrassed I left him standing in line by himself and went to the car.\n\nWe argued the entire drive home. We were supposed to go to the movies, because he got free tickets, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood so he dropped me off. We haven\u2019t texted today at all.\n\nWhen I talked to my friends at brunch, they didn\u2019t see a problem with it and I found it frustrating that they didn\u2019t understand how embarrassing it is. Am I TA or is this normal?",

Just like the \"impulse shelves\" in some supermarkets: you're standing in line, which is moving steadily, and you have limited time to grab one of the low priced (but expensive for the amount you get) packs of bubblegum or chocolate. Because there's a time pressure and a peer pressure of the people behind you, you're more likely to buy.\n\n>and call ahead next time to make sure the coupon was good.\n\nYes to this.

And calling him a \"cheapskate\"? You've been dating four months. I can't see this relationship lasting if you continue with that attitude.\n\nYTA.",

My Dad was very clear that we were worth as much as anyone else and we do not accept hand-outs.  I understand that being aggressively cheap can be really damn embarrassing.\n\nI had a boyfriend like this for a while - would try to haggle with everyone and get a deal for everything and such, and it did annoy and embarrass me.  Getting a good deal is great and there's nothing wrong with it, but making every decision based on what is cheap *especially * when you don't need the money just makes it seem like you don't value the person you're spending it on or like you're impoverished and desperate.  When you're super vocal about it and doing things like bragging about it, arguing about coupons, and haggling, it seems like you're loudly advertising the fact that you're money-insecure, which is not a great look, IMO.  I once had that boyfriend leave me alone in a restaurant for an extended amount of time to go back to our hotel room and search for a coupon for that restaurant which he couldn't find and thought he had left behind.  He couldn't find it and then tried to talk the waitress into accepting it anyway while describing it.  The coupon was for like $2 off!  I was mortified.  I just wanted to pay and leave and it ended up leading  to a fight, so I totally get where you're coming from.  \n\nAnd before anyone makes any asinine assumptions; no, I am not a gold digger.  I make plenty of my own money, pay for every-other meal of everyone I've ever dated, and otherwise split expenses 50/50 down the middle.\n\nEDIT: Just FYI For all you binary thinkers out there, there is such a thing as moderate thinking left in this world.  Just because I think there's a line someone can cross which goes beyond being frugal and into being miserly doesn't mean I think someone should never use a coupon or wait for a holiday sale day or tell themselves \"no\"; geez!  One can take literally ANYTHING too far.  You can take eating healthy too far, you can take gift-giving too far, you can take any relatively positive thing too far.  Just because someone doesn't want to eat only unsalted homemade vegan raw diet meals, for example, doesn't mean they only eat fast food and hostess snack cakes.  There is such a thing as a middle ground.   Is this really such a foreign concept?  Likewise, just because I would find it cringe-worthy to haggle and fight stores on their coupon policies on a regular basis does not mean I'm living paycheck-to-paycheck, engaging in conspicuous consumption to impress people, and not saving for retirement.

Meals will make no sense, you can\u2019t plan if your just going to eat whatever was reduced at the supermarket today.\n\nI also don\u2019t think people appreciate how frustrating this is when EVERY decision is based on this.

OP is going to sound like a reasonable person or a villain simply based on how we experienced someone like them.\n\nTo some people, the deal is about winning some sort of invisible game. Who doesn\u2019t love a good sale at the grocery store? But if you refuse to cook the dish that you were both really excited to make because you can\u2019t find a curry on sale, that\u2019s going to grate on a lot of people\u2019s nerves.\n\nSame with mentioning a shirt. We all love a sale, but most of us don\u2019t care about the shirt you got for half price. Like I really don\u2019t care if you spent $5 or $150 on your t-shirt. Sometimes, people do some impressive couponing or find something amazing at a sample sale, but usually a shirt on sale is unremarkable. If OP\u2019s bf is mentioning this all the time, the embarrassment might not be just from saying it\u2019s on sale. It could be more of a \u201cread the room\u201d type thing or just being sick of hearing it.\n\nI dated a guy (who was also insanely cheap with my money and controlling about it) who had to tell everyone he grew up on a farm. Sometimes it was very relevant and even added a great detail to the conversation. Other times, not only was it irrelevant, it came across as virtue signaling. So I could also see embarrassment stemming from something like that if her bf mentioned it at a very weird time.",

It\u2019s at least 30% and perhaps 50% cheaper that way.  So certainly nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe restaurant one I find weird.  If you are going out to eat rather than cooking at home you are already blowing the food budget out of the water so just go where you get the most enjoyment.  But again if he wants to save money that\u2019s fine.  It shouldn\u2019t be embarrassing for someone to use the items the restaurant provides.\n\nI\u2019m with him on clothing as well.  Why would anyone ever pay retail for any clothing?  Especially men\u2019s where style changes much more slowly than women.\n\nSo I think you are over reacting by being embarrassed and therefore are the asshole in this situation.  Have you considered why you find being frugal embarrassing?",

          "content": "I mean like with anything there's a limit. Being frugal and using smart tricks to keep costs down certainly is smart. But it can be obsessive. For example I remember a time in my life where I tried to pay as little as possible for every single thing even though financially it didn't have to. However it was to such an extent that I wouldn't buy/eat/do things I wanted to do just because they weren't the cheapest option available. Like I'd see a cheap snack in the grocery store and crave it so bad. But would instead buy something a few cents cheaper just to save money.\n\nFor example let's say there was a plain and a flavoured hummus. The flavoured hummus looked amazing but was slightly more expensive. So I'd never buy it. And if I did I'd feel guilty about the 'wasted' few cents that the flavoured hummus cost extra.\n\nOr there'd be an aged or an unaged cheese. I LOVE aged cheese. But wouldn't buy/consume any for years because unaged was cheaper.\n\nBeing frugal and thrifty is great! But spending money on yourself isn't always money wasted. Even if it is just something like getting some name-brand snacks or soda once in a while or just going to your favourite restaurant even if you have a coupon for the place next door. You can try and be reasonable with your money and still live life to fullest by splurging on small 'unimportant' things that bring you joy.\n\nLike in all things there needs to be a balance. And being too obsessive can become extremely restrictive and mentally draining.\n\nPersonally what worked for me in this regard was set up a budget. Yes I could live off of 1 pound a day of food if I needed to. But I sat my budget at 4 originally so I could enjoy a greater variety of food, splurge on my favourites, etc. And my budget was still an amount I found reasonable. Which meant that even my 'splurges' didn't leave me guilt-ridden or in fear of 'wasting' money. Because every cent I spent wasn't money out of my savingsaccount, it was money that needed to be spent this month on food! It was NOT going into my savings either way. If I had any leftover at the end of the month it would just get added to my grocery budget for next month.\n\nThat being said OOP's concerns really don't seem to focus on the right thing. She isn't concerned about his well-being or whether his need to 'save' money by getting deals is constrictive in an emotional way and keeping him from enjoying himself. If she genuinely felt worried about his behaviour/habits and feels they are too restrictive she should have brought those things up to him. Not as her primary concern being social embarrassment but concern for his well-being. In this way he might have either been able to assuage her fears or they could have revised his spending habits together and come up with a compromise/gameplan that alleviates some of the pressure he may feel to get a 'deal' on everything he purchases.",
