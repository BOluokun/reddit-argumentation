  "post content": "Hello reddit \nI am a 41f and work at a small independent grocery. And I've been here forever.\nThis whole year has been a rollercoaster for us. I mean, it's a town of less then 2000 people, but our store has become the main shopping place for several surrounding communities, because the bigger towns are riddled with the big yuck and people have been swarming to our store. And being so short staffed is exhausting. When they find someone new, we treat them with kid gloves and pray they work out. \nThey hired a new girl this week, and the woman who usually trains people is out with being sick, so they asked me to. This kid a 20 y/o dropout w 2 kids under 4, and lives with her parents - we all have our paths to follow. But her world view is f'd up. She starts her first day telling me, a stranger, how women aren't really women unless they have children (which I don't) and mothers aren't really mothers unless they have more than one child. Say what now?! \nI asked if she was religious (I honestly thought she was in a weird cult) she claims to be atheist. I have never been so offended in my life, the kid gloves came off, and I lost my shit. The owner and my coworkers are all split. We need the help, and we are all exhausted, and everything just sucks. \n\nAita?",

You also belittled her life choices and cursed at her (which some people are deeply offended by). It\u2019s particularly bad because you were in a supervisory role as her trainer. I wouldn\u2019t beat yourself up because you\u2019re under pressure, but yeah, no good.",

On the other hand...... this kid needs to learn to keep her weird viewpoints to herself. It was totally inappropriate for her to start evangelizing her bizarre offensive opinions to her new coworkers. Depending on what \"lost my shit\" means, maybe ESH? Wouldn't fault you for telling her off pretty sternly and vehemently, but if you totally lost your temper and started yelling or cursing, admittedly that's not great.",

I am going with ESH, just because you need to learn your audience before saying that people aren't women if they haven't had children, especially if you are still living of your parents. I would have waited and gone to her supervisor to explain what was going on and had them handle it.",

That's a lot.",

Based on this and some of the info you gave about her background, I think your reaction was heavily influenced by her personally rather than what she said. Granted what she said was terrible, and if I were her boss I would've fired her, but I think there were some other things in there that caused you to overreact.",
