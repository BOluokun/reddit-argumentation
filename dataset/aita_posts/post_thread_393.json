  "post content": "My MIL has made a small \"family quilt\" for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). The quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. I was really looking forward to getting ours because I admit I'm a bit of a hipster and I love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home.\n\nShe recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and I thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. I asked my SIL (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. I was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. Turns out MIL has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.\n\nI message her directly about it because I'm just that kind of person. I like hearing it straight from the other guy. MIL says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. I ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though I know it's a lie. I push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little \"break\" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.\n\nI ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. I tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says \"I'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs\" verbatim. I hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side.\n\nBut now I got a really mean voice message from my SIL telling me that I crossed the line and am acting like a huge B\\*tch for no reason. I'm shocked because I have a great relationship with my SIL and she always defended me from other family bullshit. My husband wants no part in this now. AITA for what I said to my MIL?",

This is a gift, she is free to choose to not give you one.\n\nYou are also free to make your conclusions about your relationship from that. She sucks, too, for not treating all her kids equally quilt-wise, but you asked about whether you were TA for saying what you did to her - and you were TA for demanding a handmade quilt, with a deadline to boot.",

              "content": "Agree 100%. I get the feeling OP has no idea how much work goes into a quilt, and the thought of making one that will only last one generation before it ends up in a charity shop is sad. \n\nOn top of this, I much prefer knitting and sewing gifts for children as I feel like children don't care too much about style, and appreciate the item for what it is, even if it's not perfect. And parents are really appreciative of such a personal gift. I know it's a gross over generalisation, but homes with young families tend to be filled with children's drawings and sentimental stuff and a quilt will fit right in. If I was OPs MIL I'd be nervous to knit a quilt for someone with a distinct \"kitschy\" and \"hipster\" style in case I missed the mark. It's SO personal and SO MUCH work just for OP to potentially decide it doesn't go with their colour scheme.",

Some things stuck out at me from the post. \n\n-She wants one because she is a hipster and thinks they\u2019re fun and kitschy (cue the eyes rolling here)\n-The SIL that told her off has always stuck up for her in other family issues/conflicts (making me think OP has stirred up the family drama previously)\n-Putting a deadline on when she wants her MIL to \u201cgift\u201d her with a hand-crafted quilt by asking how long her MIL\u2019s break will last\n-Equating her \u201cbeautiful dogs\u201d with her MIL\u2019s grandkids. Now, I have dogs, I have always had them and I will have them til I die most likely. However, to try to make pets equal to grandchildren to a grandmother is not only a losing battle, but will come off as highly offensive to her MIL and likely the entire rest of her in-laws. \n\nIn addition, quilts are very highly labor-intensive. I make jewelry and it\u2019s also fairly labor-intensive and costly buying semiprecious beads and gems. I can spend a couple of hours just figuring out the style and beading on a single bracelet and it pisses me off when people see a piece I made for myself or someone else and want me to make it (free of charge of course) for them or their second cousin\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s coworker\u2019s grandma whose birthday is coming up tomorrow.

My younger brother has expressed to me that he would like me to knit him something - to be \u201cput on the waiting list\u201d, so to speak.   I don\u2019t mind that, at all, and I don\u2019t even mind that he asked me in a vaguely obnoxious way that showed he had no *true* understanding of how much labour is involved in knitting a sweater. \n\nBut when I warned him that it might take me a while to get to it because of the arthritis in my hands, he cheerfully agreed and then jokingly threatened to confiscate my knitting bag if he found me pushing myself too hard and in pain.   We had that conversation a solid year ago and he hasn\u2019t brought it up again.\n\nIf he had instead dismissed my arthritis, told me I was lying, and gone on a rant about how obviously I don\u2019t love him because he\u2019s not married and doesn\u2019t have kids (or whatever) and that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t knitted him a jumper yet, then I flatly would never, ever, ever make him anything.
