And I'm sick (with fever). I was not allowed to leave the table as it'd be very rude (it's a religious holiday dinner for them) and my bf is not here (he's at work and won't be back until after this is over).\n\nThe wife is very kind and pretty much just lets me chill at the corner but the cousin gave me a dirty look and I already know he will complain to my bf that I was not social and was just on my phone the whole evening. So preparing for it in advance (and giving him a heads up) I texted my bf letting him now I'm just chilling on my phone and helping around if needed. And I'm well aware there will be an argument on the matter tonight.\n\nSo am I the A Hole for being on my phone?\n\n\nUpdate: English speakers have arrived so I had some socializing and that was that I suppose \ud83e\udd37",

With the language barrier, I would have just gone to my room and had the husband explain later. Its ridiculous that you're expected to sit and just eat (if you're able while sick) in silence while not engaging with anyone else. Religious people never cease to amaze me.",

Did he want you to infect everyone? Did he want you to sit there silently smiling and doing absolutely nothing? SMH",
