  "post content": "My husband was out of town on a Saturday for a sporting event he left in the morning and wasn\u2019t home until around midnight that night. We have 3 kids 13, 10, and 3 so I was home alone with them which is fine and normal since he travels for work often as well. However on this particular day I wasn\u2019t feeling well (tmi) I had just gotten my period and I suffer for the first day with major headaches, backache, cramps etc. normally, I can manage these pains by working out prior to or during and for some reason I don\u2019t suffer from the pain as much and am able to function like a normal being. I didn\u2019t work out this week because I just didn\u2019t have time so here we are. I just could not function on this day and just hoped that if I laid in bad and got some rest I would feel better and be able to get it together. In the mean time I let my older boys play video games and my 3 year old played with toys on the bed next to me while I rest. I couldn\u2019t get it together I ended up feeling like this for the majority of the day. We don\u2019t have family in the state we live so calling grandma wasn\u2019t an option. So I let my boys play video games for basically the whole day (they normally have an allocated amount of screen time). I played with my 3 year old with toys while I lay in bed and I ordered all of their meals for the day just waiting for the clock to hit bed time. I didn\u2019t make anyone shower and eventually we all went to bed. This is not how a normal day would pan out so I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal to let this happen on this particular day being that I felt like sh*t. Anyway my husband was pissed that I let the kids play video games all day and let them eat take out for all 3 meals and made me feel like an A-Hole. I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal being that I usually cook healthy meals and they have pretty rounded schedules for the most part I didn\u2019t think one day would be such a big deal plus needless to say my boys loved the fact that they could FaceTime their friends and play video games all day so it\u2019s not like they were miserable. But he really made me feel like an A-Hole for neglecting the kids.\n\nEdit: I left out the part of how I didn\u2019t take my older son to his basketball game that day either. He did have a game and he said he didn\u2019t want to go he loves basketball and is super good at the game. I know my son well enough to know he didn\u2019t want to go because of the fact that it was basically a free for all at home and he didn\u2019t want to miss out. I knew that and basically didn\u2019t care since he made the decision not to go and I didn\u2019t guilt. I guess that was a part of the main issue that my husband said I let him back out of a commitment to just sit around and play games all day especially knowing that he was backing out bc video games were is priority.\n\nMore info: Just to answer a few questions that\ncame up, I did not include the basketball game in my original post because it wasn\u2019t an issue until I showed my husband my post and the responses and that is when he mentioned my son missing the game as mainly why it was messed up and that is why i included it in the edit but prior his main concern was that they were on video games all day and ate crap all day. He's never missed a practice\nor game before in the many years that he's been playing other than this one time. I had taken a few tylenol and was very fatigued there was no way i was going to put my 3 kids in a car and drive them anywhere. I did call the coach ahead of time to let him know and he was fine with it (a bit bummed\nbc he is a great player but they had enough kids to play). Could I have sent him with a friend? Yes. However a month ago he did have to ride with a friend home from practice bc I had to get my other son to Drama and they got in an accident and he's a little nervous right now about getting in the car with others. \n\nThe kids schedules aren't military structured, they are in school most the day and after school my older has basketball or football and academic decathlon. My other son does drama, chess, and science club. when they get home its usually dinner and homework so there isn't much time for\nvideo games so we usually carry that in our favor and it aides in the 1 hour screen time rule. all of the kids after school activities are theirs by choice meaning these are things they ask to do. Some of these events carry out into the weekend but the rule is still there of 1 hour screen time (video games).\n\nIt wasn't a financial issue regarding the take out it was more that he's a bit of a health nut and once in a while is cool but 3 times in 1 day is crazy to him. Yes, my older son can make his own food however his clean up isn't the best and i didn't want to deal with that. also, maybe I was feeling a bit guilty for not being present and that could be why i ordered in rather than told them to figure it out. Yes, he also could have watched my youngest and he is helpful in that way when i need him to, like if I'm making dinner or something like that but I thought it would be really messed up if I made him do that for the whole day while I just lay there.\n\nAlso, he was at a warriors game last night (6 hours from where we live) my oldest son was with him but the other two were home with me and things did not go the way they did the last week so no this isn't a common thing.",

Missing a few days of school is no big deal when you\u2019re younger as long as you teach your kids that school and grades are important and that missing a few days does not mean it will happen all the time. \n\nMy parents didn\u2019t want us to miss any school. Obviously if we had the flu or something we wouldn\u2019t go, but if it was a little stomach ache or small headache, we were given medicine and our butts would be in the car with the rest of them. \n\nOne time I felt sick. My mom told me I had to go to school. I got halfway through before I went to the office. Mom was mad thinking I was pulling the sick card again and drove down to get me. Tells me to go out to the car while she signs me out. I sat in the car and started to close the door before I caught it and barely managed to throw up outside.\n\nI think because of this, when I was younger part of me would lie to miss a day. Sometimes school, classmates, or teachers can be a lot and you just need a break. \n\nLet your kids be able to talk to you about these things. Give them a break. Work it out together and they can go back the next day. Let them know it\u2019s not okay to skip important things such as school, but that their health is also important and they have to understand when their school work will be affected by their health (whether that\u2019s physically or mentally)",

Healthy homemade meals aren't always a possibility when someone doesn't feel well. Kids learn this is **okay** and they learn to adapt to changes. Yes, honoring your commitments are always important, but not when a person is sick and they either can't or it would be detrimental to their health. This type of lesson is really important later in life when they meet people with mental illnesses or diseases they can't see.\n\n\n\nOften times people will automatically assume the person is lazy, not living up to commitments, and not telling the truth. But you're helping to teach your kids, No, these people aren't lazy, they are sick.\n\n\n\n**\"Remember when you were younger and there were a few days where mommy didn't feel well? She would rest in bed and play with younger sibling while you guys were responsible for entering yourselves. You mostly played video games and everyone ate take out? You guys had a lot of fun! But, mommy didn't look sick on the outside did she? That actually happens a lot. Just because mommy didn't look sick didn't mean she wasn't.  So just because this person doesn't look sick it doesn't mean they're lieing and just being lazy does it?\"**\n\n\n\nThis is how children learn empathy.
