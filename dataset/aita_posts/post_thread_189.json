  "post content": "This is a throwaway so it doesn't get traced back to our organization and make drama in our community.\n\nI run a summer camp for a kids with a specific medical disorder.  I am the camp director.  Because of genetics, many of our community have familial relationships.  The organization is completely run by volunteers, including myself. I don't have the medical needs of the camp, but over the years of working in it, I've been accepted by the community.\n\nThis past year, one of our long-time campers (teenager) came out as bisexual. One of our volunteer cabin counselors, who has been with the organization since before I started working with the camp, has said that they don't feel comfortable with that, and has asked that this child not be placed in their cabin.\n\nI told the volunteer that their job was to love, care for, and support the kids. If the child's bisexuality got in the way of it, then I wouldn't be needing them as a volunteer at camp at all.   I told them they didn't need to agree with every life decision the kids made, or even openly support the teen about their bisexuality--if they wanted to, they could just not say anything about it.  They're a volunteer and I can't police their beliefs.  But not only was it not reasonable for the counselor to make that request, but it made me question if they were suited to take care of and support any of the kids at all.  I need cabin counselors who love the campers unconditionally.\n\nAs a side note, our camp is so small in numbers that even if this person weren't the child's cabin counselor, they would interact with the child.\n\nOther people in the organization told me that we need the volunteers and I was too harsh.  It wasn't that big of a deal to just put this counselor with a different cabin.  Yeah, we always need volunteers, but we need the right volunteers, and this makes me think they aren't the right volunteer. Some parents/former campers got wind of it (probably from the volunteer), and they have told me that this volunteer has been a part of the camp family for a long time, longer than me, and I overstepped my authority.   Did I overreact?  Am I on a power trip?\n\nNow that I've heard the feedback, I'm wondering if maybe it was too much.  They've been a good counselor in the past. I think I might be the A-Hole because I was kind of giving an ultimatum that could be unreasonable.\n\nIf it matters: I have a Board of Directors over me, but I checked the bylaws, and they say that staffing decisions are the decision of the Camp Director alone.  The Board doesn't make any final decisions about how camp is run. If they disagree with me to an extreme, they can remove me from my position.  Some Board members have said they disagree with me, some say they don't, but all of them have stated that they don't think it's a big enough disagreement to remove me as camp director.",

Health is part of intersectionality.

Good on you for checking!\n\nIs it possible for you to leverage the camps\u2019 external comms resources to express solidarity during Pride month, or do something to otherwise signal your intentions to accept all? It may help mitigate a volunteer who wants to burn your reputation.\n\nEdit: NTA. And TY for the work you\u2019re doing!",

I would give the volunteer another chance by calmly explaining that they can not let their views affect their role as a counselor, and maybe see if you can find some LGBTQ bias training resources for them. If they're unwilling to treat all campers the same, I'd get rid of them, and make it clear that it's because of their treatment toward the campers and not their beliefs themselves.\n\nIf you have the resources to do a bias training session for all the staff and volunteers, that would probably be really helpful. Even if you can't afford a professional training service, you might be able to reach out to a LGBTQ organization and see if they do presentations or have any information they can provide you with. I volunteered at a children's nature center/museum where all volunteers were required to take training on how to accommodate children with special needs or behavioral problems and general sensitivity training in addition to basic first aid. I thought it was extremely beneficial, because sometimes people act inappropriately out of ignorance rather than hate.",
