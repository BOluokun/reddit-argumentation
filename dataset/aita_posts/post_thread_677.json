  "post content": "\nFor context, I\u2019m a quadriplegic (C7 complete) I was injured relatively and got out of rehab a month ago. There\u2019s someone who goes to school with me, let\u2019s call her Jade, that has hEDS (a joint connectivity disorder). Lately she\u2019s been messaging me a lot, trying to give me advice and kind of using me as a vent outlet. Normally this would be fine with me, but I\u2019ve had some of my own issues lately. \n\nThis week, the issue was mobility and public perception . She was ranting about how her disorder is invisible and how hard it is on public transport when she needs to sit down but doesn\u2019t \u2018look\u2019 sick. I do not relate to this issue. I\u2019m in a powered wheelchair most of the time (working on eventually being able to move to a manual one for ease of life- getting there.) I basically said \u2018that would suck.\u2019 She started to ask if I\u2019ve ever had someone tell me something like that. I haven\u2019t, and I explain that. \n\nForward to yesterday. I\u2019m on my way to physical therapy, and she texts me complaining about dislocating her knee. I look but was just arriving, so didn\u2019t immediately respond. So I guess I \u2018left her on read\u2019. After my PT session, I check my messages again. She left three question marks, each as separate messages. I say \u201csorry, was busy. Hope you feel better\u201d. Jade says \u201cthanks, what were you doing?\u201d I explain physical therapy and she starts ranting about how she can\u2019t afford physical therapy and insurance won\u2019t cover it. I respond with \u201cwell do you really need it?\u201d  \n\nI wasn\u2019t intending to be accusatory, more curious. She talks to me a lot but I\u2019m definitely not an expert on hEDS. She says that not everyone has a visible disability like I do and that she has it just as hard as me. And I know I probably should\u2019ve not said anything, but at that point a little part of me broke. She\u2019d been complaining for me for weeks about how hard it is to stand up on the bus, how hard it is to walk from a to b without dislocating something. And that sucks- I get it. But at the same time she\u2019s just been really dismissive of any issue I\u2019ve had, not really letting me bring it up. So I basically say \u201ccome back when you break your spine, at least you can walk.\u201d \n\nAfter that, she goes silent. I do feel slightly guilty and there\u2019s definitely a better way to have phrased that- but at that point I was just really fed up. Today I\u2019ve dealt with the repercussions in my friend group. She told everyone what I said, and the reception has been pretty mixed. I  don\u2019t really know what to think. I know that what I said was a bit rude- but I don\u2019t know if that makes me an asshole or if it was justified. Any opinions are welcome!\n\nEdit to address some comments: I\u2019m quadriplegic because all four limbs have limited function, with function in my legs being completely gone, and function in my arms only being somewhat gone. The way I was injured makes it so I have some movement in my arms, but yes that\u2019s still quadriplegia as function is still heavy impacted! A couple people were confused by this and I thought I\u2019d clarify.",

There is no doubt in my mind that Karen faces some serious and unique challenges as a result of her condition - and that she probably doesn't get a lot of understanding or empathy from other people in her life about these challenges due to the nature of her condition. That sucks and is understandable. \n\nWhat she's doing is latching on to you as an outlet for these feelings, under the presumption that because of your condition, you will understand and empathize where others wouldn't. The problem is that in doing so, she is projecting her own challenges on to you based on assumptions about your experience based on the way you look - in essence, the same sort of biased behavior she encounters in her own life. That isn't cool. \n\nI think you're N-T-A because you did your best here. She's not treating you like your own person or valuing your friendship on its merits - rather you're an emotional outlet to her **solely because of your visible disability**. That's exhausting and disrespectful to you, even if she doesn't mean it that way, and you snapped. \n\nI think she's N-T-A because this is a really complex social dynamic, not your run-of-the-mill obvious asshole behavior.
