We argue, we fight, sometimes even get into screaming matches but thankfully nothing physical, at least we agree on that.\n\nMy brother has always seemed to dislike the stuff I like mostly for reasons I don\u2019t understand, every time I say get my rollerblades on when walking the dog, he grunts at me or flat out tells me \u201cdon\u2019t bring your rollerblades\u201d even though he never explains why. Or whenever we decide to play a game of MTG commander, he always gets so annoyed or even angry whenever I so much as start getting the upper hand. He used to be very snoopy, although the last time I caught him trying to break into my phone or enter my room was 2 years ago so I\u2019m not as angry about that. He also always thinks my friends (which are mostly online) and even my lover are fakes and lying to me without any proof or reasons, whenever I tell him he\u2019s being dismissive he tells me \u201cdeal with it\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s mainly important is when we walk together, him and I both walk to school at the same time, and most of the time we \u201ctalk\u201d. However he always starts rambling about anime which he knows I don\u2019t like, whenever he asks why I don\u2019t like it or don\u2019t wanna watch it I usually give him the same reasons, typically one of which is because he keeps spoiling it for me, but then he goes back to rambling anyway and then complains whenever I wanna put music in, and even tells me \u201cdo you even care?\u201d When I try and change the subject or try to bring up something I know we both like.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might be a**hole. Today I couldn\u2019t take anymore of him being dismissive (or at least I think so) and snapped at him during our walk to school today, calling him out for talking constantly about stuff he knows I don\u2019t like, being dismissive of my likes and friends, and overall just being a jerk. He fell silent and started to cry, calling me an uncaring brother and telling me I\u2019m the only person he can talk to, I brought up his friends at school (he talks to them online after school), and he said \u201cthey aren\u2019t always on\u201d and kept going off on me about how I don\u2019t care, that I\u2019m a bad brother, that all I do is hate him, etc. we didn\u2019t talk for the rest of the walk.\n\nAITA? I love my brother still, we wouldn\u2019t talk or play MTG together otherwise, but I felt like this needed to be addressed, if I\u2019m wrong please put me in my place",

This will pass and you're relationship will keep changing and growing as you get older. I council patiance (i'm the eldest of 5) and just trying to roll with whatever the younger ones want to talk about.
