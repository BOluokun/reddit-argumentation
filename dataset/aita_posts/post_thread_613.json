I love him dearly. My brother struggles with his self confidence a great deal. I try to build him up as much as i possibly can but he refuses to listen. \n\nI guess this is what I struggle with most. He is always asking for advice on every problem but will not take my advice. I've tried being \"the therapist\" by liistening to his concerns and taking the time to give him what I think is good sound advice. Like he has had trouble making friends. I found a couple meetups for him with people of shared interests but nothing came of it. Or he wants to start a YouTube channel. I gave him some ideas, channels to watch and places to start. That was 2 years ago and he's still wanting more ideas. I could go on and on, he just ignores it all. He'll get it off of his chest and then a week later he's back asking me for more advice. One day it's his job, another his finances, another his sex life, another, etc. It's like an endless river of complaints. I've tried the tough love route bytelling him to man up and stop complaining but that got me nowhere. I've gotten so drained emotionally that I've spend a few days holed up in my room trying to avoid him. *Side Note-I'm an introvert by nature and things like this can easily drain me. Also I have depression and anxiety so sometimes it just adds to it because I just take on his problems.* Does avoiding him work? No, he's woken me up at night in tears because of his problems....three times. It's been the same broken record for five years. These are all easy changes he can make but he refuses to make them. He doesn't have many friends so I feel this contributes to his loneliness but then again he chooses not to go out and find friends.\n\nIt all came to a head today. I just couldn't take it anymore and told him to never ask for my advice again if he wasn't going to take it. I told him he needed to see a real therapist and unless he was going to pay me 200 a hour then go away. Now I feel so guilty that I erupted. I don't know if he's depressed, anxious or just lazy. I've asked him many times and encouraged him to talk to a doctor. It fell on deaf ears. AITA?",

      "content": "NAH. Based on what you've said, it does sound like your brother is struggling with his mental health. He should seek help for sure, but sometimes getting people to go to therapy is like trying to pull teeth from an unsedated tiger. It sounds like you just have to calmly state that you don't have the capacity to help him in the way he wants you to, because it's becoming too much for you. Putting yourself first, at least in this situation, is completely understandable. I hope yall can work it out and that your brother gets some help!",
