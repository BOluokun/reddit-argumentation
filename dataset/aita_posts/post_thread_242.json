  "post content": "\nMy f32, sister f28, and her husband m32 moved in with us 2 days ago after they lost their apartment to medical debts for their child (my nephew). My husband and I are more than happy to have them stay for few weeks til they get this resolved.\n\n\nHowever, Yesterday at 7pm, I was in the kitchen when my husband rushed in and said that he saw both my sister and her husband walk out of the bathroom. They'd most likely taken a shower together. My husband said that it irked him and I agreed that what they did was somewhat inappropriate. He asked me to speak to my sister on the matter and I did. She got defensive asking how this is affecting me or my husband in any way. I told her that it made my husband feel uncomfortable and would rather that they just take their showers seperately. She started ranting about being overwhelmed by their son's health problems and not having some alone time together as a married couple and found this activity as a bonding time to spend together. I apologized for how she felt but requested that she just do as asked. She got mad at me and said that I was being inconsiderate and she didn't understand my husband's hangup on what she and her husband do. We started arguing and she stormed off to the guests room where my nephew and BIL are.\n\n\nShe's not speaking to me but my husband said I did the right thing by speaking to her and setting this boundary.\n\n\nAITA? Am I (and my husband) overreacted to this?\n\n\nSome infos:\n\n1. My husband did not mention hearing anything, just that he saw them get out of the bathroom. And yes they were clothed.\n\n2. It's the only bathroom in the house.\n\n3. They spent apprximately 10+ in the shower according to my husband.\n\nEDIT* I'm gonna bring my husband to look at the responses and help answer some questions down here, okay? Just give me a few minutes.\n\n\nEDIT* I'm sorry I can't respond to every single comment but my husband says he's uncomfortable and doesn't want to expand on the situation.",

Leave them alone they're stressed enough as it is.\n\nEdit: \nObligatory wow I didn't expect all the updoots and awards, thanks! \n\nMore importantly - I was a bit flippant in my original comment, so I want to use my newfound fame and glory (lol) to say something to everyone saying \"your house your rules\" or \"they need to get a hotel\". That's all fine and good, we're here to give our opinions on the situation, but can we remember:\n\nThis couple just lost their home. \nThey are in serious medical debt. \nThey have a very sick child. \n\nThe likelihood of their marriage surviving the immense stress and hardship they are experiencing is statistically low. \n\nCan we get some compassion for these people? Can you leave your personal hangups behind and give them some support? Can you find happiness that they are making time and effort to spend together? What's really more important here?",

He said Jessica Alba was hitting on him and in his dream he apologized and said he was happily married.  He's like 'That's  weird right?'  I'm like 'No, it's literally the sweetest thing I've ever heard.'\n\nMy mother is someone who is not good about demonstrating emotions.  Neurodivergent, bad childhood, etc.  She was super pissy one day, just miserable to everyone.  I don't typically break confidences, but sometimes a rap on the noggin' is kindness when you haven't necessarily earned it.  I had been holding onto the 'Jessica Alba Dream' story for awhile so I was just talking about relationships and the ways people demonstrate love, loyalty, etc.  And I told her the story and she just looked at me and teared up.  She got really quiet and shortly after my father walked in she looked at him and in a completely different tone asked what he wanted for dinner and served him and picked up his dishes and was very kind to him all night.  To my knowledge he still doesn't know she knows.\n\n\nThey have had more than their fair share of struggles but I think the little things like showering together, meals together, etc have made the difference in keeping them together.",

Then OP immediately acquiesces and does so - even though she apparently cannot articulate *why* the concept of a married couple taking a quiet shower together is very offensive. Then, after OP starts a whole shit show by this demand that her sister and spouse MUST WASTE WATER AND TIE UP THE SINGLE BATHROOM IN THE HOUSE for even longer by showering separately...OP's husband still declined to elaborate on why this made his so very uncomfortable. The only explanation that would make him reluctant to elaborate would be something that involves the OP's sister....naked and showering ALONE.  Because the husband being there with her sister must have completely spoiled his little fantasy somehow...(I'm aware this is speculation on my part, but the absolute ignorance behind this post entitles me to a little creative license).
