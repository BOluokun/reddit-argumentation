  "post content": "Hi,\n\nSo I run a youth group and myself and the other youth leaders were talking about dressing as the entire scooby doo gang for halloween. I was gonna be Scooby, and get a Scooby Doo onesie from Amazon. It's the whole body costume with ears etc., and a hole for a face.\n\nI was telling a group of friends what we were doing, and how I was going to then paint my face brown with some of the Scooby freckles etc. One in particular suddenly had a face was like I'd just slapped him. \"You can't do that!\" he said. \"That's blackface!\"\n\nTurns out he, and several others at the table, think that me, as a white guy, painting my face Scooby-Doo brown, would be blackface. To me I hadn't even considered that there would be any racial connotations whatsoever - it's a dog, not a person of another race - and that I shouldn't do it. Not sure whether it matters, but everyone saying it would be wrong was white, the one black guy at the table had no problem with it at all.\n\nTo me, this seems like an incredibly unhelpful level of insensitivity which is only aimed at getting outraged wherever possible, not at actual injustice.\n\nSo, if I go ahead with dressing as Scoob for Halloween, face painted brown (AS A DOG) - WIBTA?\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, one guy said \"Even if it's not wrong, if you took off the costume you'd just be left with a brown face and that'd be really bad\" which I guess is true that I'd have a brown face but I don't think brown face instantly equals racism so I think unless I run for prime minister of Canada in 40 years time and the photos resurface I should be good?\n\nEdit 2: I'm gonna scooby dooby do it",

Other people aren\u2019t psychic and are not required to wait for a white guy\u2019s explanation that \u201chey I know it looked exactly like brown face but I totally have a reasonable explanation\u201d.\n\nAlso, given your defensiveness on the issue, part of you doing this now would be influenced by a \u201cI\u2019ll show THEM\u201d attitude, them being your friends and, frankly, any not-white person who might see you and need to roll the dice on assessing whether this was your way of doing a racism \u201cbut not teeeechnically\u201d.\n\nI would encourage you instead to read up on blackface and brown face, and not by people who think it\u2019s bunk.
