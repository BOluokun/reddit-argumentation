Altough i always loved my stepmom, i never called her mom, the maximum i would do is refer to her and my dad as my parents. \n\nWhen i was 18, my stepmom asked me and my siblings if she could adopt us. My siblings said yes but i refused, i explained that i loved her but i wanted to keep my mom as my legal mom. \n\nFrom that moment she started to treat me differently. I moved out soon after but i would always visit, she was cordial to me like you are with strangers, she introduced my siblings as her kids and my as her husband's son. Me and my dad tried to talk to her but she just bruched us off saying that it was all in our head. \n\n3 years ago, me and my sister became parents. With my son my stepmom would be inpatient and rude but with my niece she would be the calmest person in the world. \n\nI had enough and asked what did i do for her to go 180\u00b0 on me. She said i was reaping what i sowed, that i rejected her as a mom so that she rejected me as a son. \n\nAfter that i had gaven up in our relationship, we were cordial and that was it. My dad tried many times to reconsile us to no avail. \n\n1 1/2 ago she got diagnosed with a terminal illness. Out of family i'm the one most well off so my father called me and asked me to pay for her treatments. \n\nI visited and had a talk with her. She apologized for treating me badly and said she loved me like a son and that she had a bad reaction to my refusal of the adoption and regret it. \n\nShe died a week ago, i only found out because my father called after and explained she didn't wanted me there because she only wanted \"family\". \n\nMy siblings have aproached me and asked me to pay for her funeral expenses and i have refused. \n\nThey called me and a-hole saying that i couldn't be mad for being excluded because i did it to myself when i refused to be adopted. \n\nMy wife is on my side and even tough my dad says he understands me he said i should do it for my siblings because my stepmom was their mom",

I get that on a societal level for various reasons but where individuals are concerned, I would say that you have no obligation even if you guys got along.  Your stepmom sounds like she was an embittered person who craved holding onto a good grudge.",

Write them all an email saying that you extended yourself to pay for her treatments, in spite of the complicated feelings and family situation that existed. And while you don\u2019t want to hurt them the way that you were hurt by being excluded from stepmom\u2019s final moments on earth even after you helped with her treatment, you are simply unable to pay for the funeral too. You join them in their grief, love them dearly, and urge them not to displace any feelings of sadness/anger they may have onto you.
