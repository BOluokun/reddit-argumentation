Tom has another child with his ex-wife, Connor (13M). \n\nAt the time of the divorce (I only met him 3 years later) Tom had a stable job that paid well, so the judge ruled child-support for his son very high and Tom had no problem paying. He h\u00e1s visits on weekends. \n\nAfter 1 year of our son, Tom was fired and found a job that paid much less than the previous one. For comparison purposes, the old salary the child support took 30% and with the current one, it takes 85%. \n\nThis created tension between us. I had to start working hard and twice as normal, because Tom couldn't help almost anything at home, as there was only 15% of his salary left after paying my stepson's child support. Even though I talked to him, he said he didn't want to downsize so as not to harm Connor and and I really tried to be understanding.\n\nThis reached my limit, when I had an accident and I was out of work for 3 months, I am self-employed and my salary has decreased by 95%. In those 3 months, we didn't go hungry because my sister helped. \n\nAnd if he was 1 day late in paying child support, Tom's ex would call him and charge him, not caring that we were tight. \n\n2 months like this, I sat down with Tom and told him that our son had the same quality of life rights as his brother, which is not happening and is harming my health (the accident was due to stress). So, it was his decision, but that I would do whatever was necessary for my son to have a good quality and it was time to realize that it is not possible to maintain this value of child support without interfering in the quality of life of his other son without I have to cover the hole.\n\n He tried to argue, but he saw my point of vira and after 1 month seeing this, the judge asked for a reduction in the value of child support ( it was proven that it was far beyond what he could pay without interfering in his life and other kid). He fixed it to 30% of his salary. \n\nSince Tom has never complained about it, it's pretty clear that I \"influenced\" himand his ex is texting me, saying that I'm knowingly lowering my stepson's quality of life and that I should feel ashamed for doing this to a child. \n\nThis is a pretty mess and it's left to me, like the \"monster\" who did this to a child. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for my english",

IMO child support isn't mean to support an entire family, but to provide support to a child. \n\nAlso, how was his ex \"charging him\" for being 1 day late? There are people who are YEARS behind on child support payments still walking around!",

Her hubby was laid off from his job and then rehired a month later at a lower pay (he worked by contract). Proved to the judge that his pay was about 30% less than before. Judge agreed but stated that \"between his pay and his wife's pay (my friend) they could maintain the same child support\". Which really pissed off my friend. Not that she had any problems with the kids but the youngest was in 8th grade, the other two in high school. And the ex didn't work. At all. So my friend was basically paying all of their bills while nearly all of his paycheck went to child support. And they didn't have any kids between them. Ugh!",

But looking deeper, spousal income *is* typically household income. It is often vitally important that it is considered as such in cases of stay at home parents, creative professionals with highly variable incomes, disabled individuals with caregiver partners, etc. I'm not sure I'm comfortable granting an exception for prior existing children. Minor children are not a debt incurred prior to the marriage, they are an ongoing liability like a mortgage. If your new wife gets demoted and now her entire paycheck is going to the mortgage of the house that's solely in her name, you will have to pick up the slack on the rest of the bills. It isn't a perfect analogy.\n\nBoth my parents got legally fucked over in their divorce because of shit like this. My dad was very involved and wanted half custody but he had to quit his wellpaying job to have enough time to raise us. He went flat broke paying my mom child support that was based on former income rather than actual current earnings. It took years and by the time they got it recalculated, he married my stepmom. Well she basically made as much as he used to so my dad's household became wealthy, but he no longer had to support my mom's household to the same degree. She had a teaching degree ffs. She then struggled because she got the house in the divorce and couldn't afford it without help (part of the reason for the high payments in the first place). Once his household income increased via my stepmom, my dad paid my mom more than ordered. It was less than before, but enough to compensate her teaching salray and cover the high property expenses. \n\nI'm lucky my parents got there in the end. One of my friends had a mom who remarried rich but never worked and a dad who had to live in a van because the mom took so much of his paycheck even though she didn't need it.
