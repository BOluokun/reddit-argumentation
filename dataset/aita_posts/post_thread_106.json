  "post content": "Every time my wife (32F) and I (27M) go anywhere together, whether it be out to a restaurant, my parent's house, shopping, etc., we always end up having a fight before we leave, because she'll always try to leave with her 4 inch heels on. I tell her she shouldn't be wearing those for where we're going, she gets mad and tells me how much she spent on the shoes, I tell her I'm not leaving until she puts on something practical, she finally does, and she pouts for 15 minutes in the car. \n\nHere's the thing. I have no problems with her wearing heels as a concept. I don't care that she's already taller than me by 4 inches and they add on another 4 inches. I don't care that they're basically Gothic dominatrix heels. None of that matters to me. \n\nThe problem is that she is an absolute *klutz*. \n\nShe wore those heels out to a restaurant on my birthday a few years ago, and one of the heel spikes (which aren't thin) slipped into a hole in a grate on the street. She landed flat on her ass and it took a while to get the shoe unstuck out of that grate. She ruined her favorite dress in the process and got a bruised tailbone. \n\nLast year, she wore them to my parent's house, where it was raining. She slipped as soon as she got out of the car on the wet road, fell, and sprained her ankle. That was a rather expensive trip to the ER.\n\n4 months ago, she wore just two inch heels to a job interview. You can probably guess what happened, but she lost her balance in the office where she was being interview at and whacked her head on a chair, breaking her glasses as a result. Had to get evaluated for a concussion and get a new pair of glasses out of pocket. No, she did not get the job. \n\nSo every time we have this argument, I keep reminding her about all the times that she's hurt herself while wearing heels, and how its a really bad idea to wear them, especially since we live in an area that constantly rains and we go places that require a fair bit of walking in that rain. She says she's willing to accept the risks, but I really don't want our experiences ruined because she hurt herself again. \n\nI keep telling her to look for practical shoes in a style that she likes, but she complains about how she \"can't find any\" because she has size 12 feet (which okay, I get it, but online shoe stores are a thing, you know?). \n\nI'm kind of at my last straw because we argued about it again last night. We were going to go out for dinner and it was rather rainy. Once again I refused to go out unless she wore practical shoes for safety reasons. She called me a controlling jerk and we didn't end up going out at all. \n\nSo reddit, *am* I a controlling jerk? I kinda feel like I am, but I really don't want to keep pitching in for ER bills because she keeps wrecking herself because of her freaking shoes.\n\nEdit: one very important thing I forgot to mention is that she has Meniere's disease, where you get random bouts of vertigo. She has stumbled and fallen while wearing sneakers before from having vertigo episodes, so it's very high risk for her to be wearing heels at all.\n\nEdit 2: So it seems pretty 50/50 so far of whether I'm an AH or not. The YTA comments are shedding some light on my behavior that I didn't really think was a problem until now I guess. So in light of that, next time we to out and she wants to wear them, I won't say anything, but I'm gonna hope that nothing bad happens as a result.",

But, as someone who is also a klutz, I've gotten in the habit of bringing flats in my purse in addition to my heels.\n\nSo. Wear the flats from the car on the walk to the restaurant. Swap them out for heels when ready to enter since all you'll be doing is sitting, eating, and occasionally walking to the restroom. Then, when dinner is over, swap em back out for flats when walking back to the car.\n\n#PROBLEM SOLVED, EVERYONE IS HAPPY AND SAFE.",
