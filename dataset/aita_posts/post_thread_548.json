I got this new microphone for Christmas, a Blue Yeti to be precise. I know it\u2019s a really good microphone and it\u2019s what a lot of great youtubers/streamers use, but my computer is in a very open area. All my brothers play with their toys in here, and it\u2019s not far from the kitchen so my two viewers can hear everything. The thing is, I already had an amazing microphone that\u2019s meant for singing, so it has a very unidirectional pickup. I don\u2019t have the heart to tell them that the blue yeti is worse than the mic I was already using, but I seriously want my stream to take off and it\u2019s not going to help to have all of my background noise in the stream. I think I\u2019m going to sell it, but would I be the A-hole for selling it?",

I always love hearing updates about how people use my gift and I\u2019m sure they would too.",
