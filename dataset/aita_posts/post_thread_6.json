  "post content": "Yesterday was my sister's (25F) engagement party. Me and my two brothers (one is 22, two of us are 21) have been on the other side of US for the majority of 2023 and didn't think we were going to be there for the party, but plans shifted and we ended up arriving home last Wednesday. \r  \n\r  \nNow I'm honestly not sure if I was invited so much as we simply happened to live where the event was being hosted, because it was held in my parents' house. My sister didn't outright say she didn't want us there, but we didn't see much of her in the lead up. We didn't really know any of the people at the party, so we're going around introducing ourselves to people, mingling, doing the party thing. At some point, someone mentions the family photos on the well and how they were surprised to see a ton of us on the wall when they didn't even know my sister had siblings.\r  \n\r  \nThis sent me down a whole rabbit hole of confusion. This person elaborated and said she was surprised to see this type of photo on the wall because apparently my sister has told all of her friends that my parents were extreme workaholics. We have a really nice house so they weren't surprised by that, just that it felt properly homey and lived in. Once again, I was thrown for a loop.\r  \n\r  \nGrowing up, our home was THE house. We had friends over constantly who were basically like extra siblings. My parents worked the normal amount, and they were home with us as much as possible. We got chauffeured around to sports practices, my parents took the time to get to know all of our friends well, etc. I would even go so far as to say they were more involved in our lives than average. It was my sister who really separated herself from everyone and chose to exclude herself from activities.\r  \n\r  \nAt some point during this conversation, a few other people overheard and soon enough there was a decent crowd of her friends around my brothers and I, listening to stories of us growing up that were blowing these people's minds because it's apparently common knowledge among their friend group that our parents were so hands on, and UN common knowledge that we even existed. I ended up having a really good time and felt like I made some new friends.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the event, apparently my sister was crying because I embarrassed her in front of all of her friends and that the work she had put in to separate herself from us \"golden children\" had been undone.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r  \n\r",

When your friends were over, we\u2019re hers?   Did parents drive to her after school activities?  Did she even have any?  \n\nI see a woman who didn\u2019t want her brothers around.  If childhood was so great, why?\n\nEDIT:  OP states that his experience might have been different to his in replies to other posts. I suggest checking out the comments he has made. It looks like he plans on talking to her so he can better understand her perspective.",

Very few families resemble the Brady Bunch or any other perfect family depicted on television. Unfortunately for those of us that grew up before the internet we would compare our families by these examples, not realizing that in reality this depiction was a fairytale.\n\nWhat is my reality? I grew up in a family of substance abusers. I used to lie to my friends about what a great family I had. As I aged telling the truth set me free. I wasn't ostracized by my friends, on the contrary I was praised for escaping, and becoming successful. I do not have a substance abuse problem, I do however carry the weight, and the scares growing up in that environment will leave. As for my siblings, I lost my last brother in 2019. All of them gone before their time from substance abuse. Painful? You bet, every day of my life. I have tears in my eyes just writing this. \n\nMy escape was joining the military where I spent 12 years Navy Spec/Ops, and am now employed at a well known university in a career. Am I someone to be admired? No, it was only by the grace of God that I took this path or I would have one foot in the grave by now without a doubt. \n\nNow this is for you OP. \nAre you the A-hole? I do not believe that you or your siblings intentionally set out to hurt your younger sister. I do however feel you knowing your sister could have been a little more sensitive to her state of mind concerning her perception of her childhood regardless of how you feel. \n\nYou say you had a wonderful childhood? I'm happy for you, but obviously your sisters recollections do not paint such a pretty picture. \n\nSo in closing OP, instead of feeling the need to defend your parents in situations such as this, you and yours might ask yourselves why does my sister feel this way, and what can we do to support her? \nShe obviously has some deep seated emotions that cut her to the core!\nMy question to you OP is why don't you know this, and why aren't you giving her what you know she needs?\nShe is your sister, your blood. With all the flaws that led to all my siblings early deaths, I would give anything to have just one sitting beside me right now!\n\nGodspeed.",

Younger sibling MUST be able to be included in anything we do. Parents have date night? Well you can\u2019t go to work or do your homework, younger sibling needs a sitter.\n\nSpeaking out against any of these things, or being upset about or acknowledging the pattern, all meant that I was a bad big sister who hated my brother and was a mean and bitter person. \n\nWe didn\u2019t realize until later that much of my brothers episodes were related to his autism, but my suggestion many many years ago we get him assessed also meant I was a bad sister who hated him and just wanted a reason to be a dick to him (no, he was struggling in school and needed help, but whatever). \n\nI was a very handy child and learned things quickly, but the second my brother was old enough, I also was excluded from typically male chores I\u2019d once enjoyed learning, even though I loved them and my brother hated them. So I just didn\u2019t hang out with my dad at all and learned the adult version of those skills on my own. \n\nWhen you\u2019re the older sister, especially if your parents wanted a boy and got one later, sometimes your life experience is *very* different. My brother only recently became aware of this, and now gets why I was often called hostile and angry as a child, and feels really grossed out that most of his \u201chappy family\u201d memories came directly at the expense of my own wants and needs. \n\nBefore I moved back to my hometown area, many of my friends also were not super aware of my sibling either, and just knew my parents were pretty much absentee for me unless they were toeing the abuse line (or jumping across it). My parents and brother were similarly hurt to realize this misconception during my wedding events, but lots of therapy and arguments still happening later, now get why it happened. \n\nSounds like OP is about to get clued in on the same thing.",

So parents set up a play date for daughter. Daughter gets her one play date. Then parents arrange for Boy A to have a play date.

The first two years or so happened *before you were born*.

Listen first, affirm her feelings (even if you're not sure about the facts - but don't say that part!), think about it later. Do not confuse listening with arguing. Those are two different things. If, upon reflection, you decide that you disagree with her on some point or another you can always tell her *later* if it seems important.\n\nQuestion (you don't have to actually answer it on this thread, but see if you can answer it in your own head for yourself): Do your parents tell as many stories of the first two years of your sister's life as they do about those two hectic years after you were born?

Our parents were both completely focused on us BUT they treated us differently, our interests matched up with family interests or didn't in very different ways, we had different levels of assertiveness, and the family circumstances--money, tension level between my parents, how many kids were still at home to divide up attention, how \"modernized\" the family was, how emotionally close we were to our nearest siblings, whether or not the oldest boy bullied us, whether or not there were neighborhood kids who matched up to us in age and interests and were available as playmates--that was all completely different in each case.  \n\nHow could it be any different?\n\nIt's the parents' job to make sure the family works for everyone.  In a large family, very few parents do an equally good job with all their children.\n\nWhen I read your comments, it doesn't sound like there was any space at all for your sister.  Reading books and being good at school doesn't mean you need less of your parents' attention.  It might mean you need more.  Were your parents skillfully meeting your sister on her own ground?  If your kid loves sports it's easy to sign them up for one sport after another, and there's a good chance they will make friends and have a great time.   The parent contribution is easy...but incredibly time-consuming and often quite expensive.  If your kid is introverted and loves books and school, you need to find the opportunities that let them thrive, too. \n\nDid your sister get as much praise/excitement and support for her interests and achievements as you and your brothers did?  Does she have a legitimate reason to see you as the golden children?",

But for about 5 years now my siblings and I keep a basic tally to make sure we're all being treated fairly financially. I'm lucky to have siblings that care enough that we back each other. For us it's just forcing them to keep their word after preaching about it for so long. My parents have since gotten on board and we can have open and calm and even sometimes happy conversations about it now. But I'm fully aware if my younger siblings reacted differently to any of this my situation would be entirely different.",

If her siblings are still blaming her for what happened as kids then there's really no way that they're supportive, understanding, or even a little empathetic. In a similar situation I'd probably be tempted to come up with the same stories she did just for the sake of simplicity and not having to constantly delve into that trauma when connecting with friends over upbringing and family history. Honestly, reading into it deeper it doesn't even seem like she outright lied it sounds more like she just said very little. Not talking about siblings can certainly seem like she might be an only child, the reaction from her friends sounds like she never mentioned one way or another and they made an assumption. Just saying she didn't have a good relationship with her parents because they worked a lot is way easier than going into the muck of her full experience. That would make a lot more sense as the reality of how she discussed her family when this party was hosted in her parents house. If she had said outright she was an only child I imagine there would be worse feelings than just slight confusion among her friends, because to be fair that's a pretty big lie to tell. These siblings have a lot to unpack, individually and together. And seriously, I hope so many good things for big sis.

If his sister was trying to get sympathy, she could have stuck far closer to the likely truth of \u201cmy brothers had a fantastic childhood, they were popular and my parents attended all their sports games. I was never given the same amount of attention, and was mostly on the sidelines because I wasn\u2019t athletic and my interests were naturally seen as less important. My parents did attend some of my awards ceremonies, but only if they didn\u2019t clash with my brother\u2019s sport events, and often one would attend while the other supported my brothers. My house was always full of other friends, but those friends were rarely mine. My childhood was quiet and quite lonely and I\u2019ve never been able to explain this to my brothers, because to them childhood was perfect.\u201d\n\nIt seems to me that she\u2019s actually downplaying her childhood difficulties. \u201cMy parents were workaholics\u201d raises far fewer questions than \u201cI was the odd one out\u201d. Not mentioning her brothers means she doesn\u2019t have to talk about how alien she felt. To me, it\u2019s an embellishment that hides a far sadder truth.\n\nI know some will see this as a bit of a reach, but OP\u2019s not given any indication that his sister has a habit of lying or manipulating. What he has clearly shown is that he\u2019ll always see his view of events as the \u201ctruth\u201d and will apply this view to others around him without thinking twice.\n\nOP, it would have been so straightforward for you to say something like \u201cour parents both did indeed work and I was at sports games a lot during childhood; my sister and I weren\u2019t that close. I can\u2019t speak for her experience, as I wasn\u2019t around her much and often had friends over when I was home. I love my sister and am so thrilled for her engagement and to get to meet all her friends\u201d. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all you had to say. Exposing her as a \u201cliar\u201d before even speaking with her didn\u2019t serve anyone other than yourself.\n\nInstead, you took this as an opportunity to \u201cmake friends\u201d by \u201cexposing\u201d your sister as a liar and holding court at HER ENGAGEMENT PARTY while her friends avidly listens to tales of YOUR fantastic childhood (important: not hers).\n\nYou didn\u2019t just \u201cembarrass\u201d your sister, you directly threatened the ecosystem she\u2019s built for herself since leaving home. I\u2019d be skeptical of a friend who felt the need to lie like you told them your sister did. I\u2019d likely look to distance myself from that person. You have no clue about the potential damage you\u2019ve caused, at an event that was supposed to be a celebration of your sister\u2019s milestone. Somehow, you managed to make yourself centre of attention on a day dedicated to her, which gives me a good idea of how her childhood likely played out. \n\nYou\u2019ve said yourself that your sister often wasn\u2019t the one with friends over, it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s ever made friends as easily as you do. You were in a room full of people who wanted to celebrate her engagement, and jumped at the opportunity to discredit your own sister, who has likely spent her life in the shadow of your narrative.\n\nI know you\u2019re pushing back against all the negative comments, and I\u2019m late to the party so you\u2019re unlikely to read this. But, for the sake of your sister, please reflect on your behaviour here. Please ask yourself whether your sister was actually \u201clying\u201d or whether she was leaning on a white lie to hide a much more painful truth. Take a second to imagine a childhood in which you had 3, close, academically gifted sisters who\u2019s weekly commitments to debate club, after school classes etc were always celebrated and attended by your parents. They tried their best to attend your sports commitments, but only if they didn\u2019t clash with one of your sister\u2019s events. If the roles were reversed, I imagine you\u2019d have told a similar story to your friends as an adult. Sometimes a lie is used as a shield, rather than as an act of malice. \n\nYTA OP, based on the information you\u2019ve provided, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve matured much since highshool. Every sibling in a family has a different childhood, and not only did you invalidate your sister\u2019s experience, you actively worked to discredit her to her entire support network. You used her event as an opportunity to make \u201cfriends\u201d and take centre stage. If you were my brother, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever speak to you again.",
