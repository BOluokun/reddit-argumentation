  "post content": "I (28m) have been dating my girlfriend (23f) for a few months. Things have gone well; we get along well so far and I really care about her and hope things work out with us.\n\nAnyway she recently invited me to come over and have dinner with her parents at their home.  She still lives with them for now. We are getting more serious and they wanted to meet me. If it's relevant her parents are Indian immigrants to the US and I am white.\n\nSo, I thought it was a completely casual meeting and I wore an Iron Maiden T-shirt. I do happen to like the band but that's not even why I wore it; that's just how I dress and that shirt just happened to be clean that day. I went and met her parents and thought we'd had a good meeting.\n\nHowever my girlfriend is NOT happy with me. She feels as if me dressing in a T-Shirt rather than a nicer button-up shirt was bad enough, but that wearing a shirt with skulls on it was--in her words--\"just obnoxious.\"\n\nI honestly just dressed for the meeting the way I usually do and didn't even think about it. I think that if she had certain standards that she should have communicated them to me beforehand. But she thinks that what I did was \"obviously stupid and inappropriate\" and that I should have known better. Is she right or is she being too critical?",

There probably should have been some conversation here first, and I tend to be of the feeling that a certain amount of onus falls on the one whose parents are being met.

You are the only one going into this with intimate knowledge of both parties. (Lest someone accuse me of sexism, I'd hold this view whether the SO happened to be male or female.)  In an ideal world, the SO might inquire themselves or intuit these things, but they may have grown up in families or communities where these things weren't viewed as important, and it may not occur to them that they would be expected to present themselves differently.\n\nIf you know that your family is ultraconservative and is going to object to the skimpy clothes your SO favors, that there are cultural expectations your SO may not understand, that their tendency to dress to the nines may feel out of place in the small rural farming community you grew up in, etc. why not help facilitate things? \n\nI'm more the \"come as you are, as long as you're covered, clean, and your attire is appropriate for whatever it is that we're going to be doing\" sort, and would likely be more uncomfortable if a hypothetical kid's SO showed up overdressed than underdressed.

If she\u2019s not wearing those kinds of clothes, then her parents would not expect OP to wear those kinds of much, much more casual clothes. Like, you must admit: the most possible casual clothes other than PJs. The SO\u2019s parents may not think particularly *badly* about OP, or judgmental, but because he dresses so much more casually compared to their daughter, they may get the impression that he\u2019s *just not a good match* for her. They may not be totally supportive of the relationship, she could be subtly mocked at home, and OP will have to work harder to win over the parents approval because he\u2019s starting at a deficit with them. OP needs to be OP, nothing should stop him from that, except his choices have consequences.

I think your girlfriend sees this as her being relatively more invested in the relationship, because you wore whichever clean t-shirt you had lying around to meet her parents for dinner. For you, it's just how you dress to meet anyone. I can see both sides.",

I would never let my SO walk into a social situation with my family without outlining their weird or quirky expectations. My only question would be if his usual style of dress was something different than a tshirt and he usually wore a button down shirt - if this shirt/style of dress was unusual and he wasn\u2019t prone to dressing in tshirts or band tshirts then she may have thought it was unnecessary to say something because he ALWAYS previously looked appropriate/dressed appropriately and that his usual style would be acceptable. You don\u2019t bring home boys to parents who are judgmental without prepping/warning them.",
