  "post content": "To start, free bleeding is essentially not wearing any form of protection on your period (so you are bleeding freely - clues in the name).\n\nI'm currently staying at my MILs house with my husband for a family get together (six birthdays in one week).\n\nI have horrifically painful periods and bad mobility. I can not use cups and am allergic to all brands of pad I've used (rashes on all genitalia, which does not feel good). I do have cloth pads but I only brought a couple small ones for my trip as I wasn't due on until days after we got home, but we're on day four of our trip and I started my period on our first night. \n\nI tried to use some disposable pads I picked up but I broke out in a rash and have blisters everywhere they should not be, so two days ago I decided to say what the hell and free bleed like I do at home.\n\nI bring my own towels to my MILs, so I have been sitting and sleeping on those. I have bled through twice but cleaned the mess and left no stain. \n\nMy MIL is pissed off to say the least. She's disgusted by my lack of decorum and carrying my bloody towel around everywhere. She also hates that I'm washing them in her machines and is now saying we need to pay to have them professionally cleaned (which we will do).\n\nEverything kinda came to a head last night when she lost it on me for \"behaving like an animal\". She wants me to leave, but my husband stay, which isn't possible (one car, I can't drive that far, especially not with the amount of pain I'm in).\n\nMy husband is on damage control but I just feel so shitty. Am I in the wrong here? I understand that it's not super sanitary but my health matters more than some bed sheets. I'll replace them if she wants.\n\nI'm close to just gritting my teeth through the pain and putting a pad on, but I really don't want to. I don't want open sores down there when we're driving home - sitting for that long will suck.\n\nAITA? I feel like I'm choosing the lessar of two evils but now I don't know.",

Period suppression is also an option with contraceptives, for the future. \u201cFree bleeding\u201d in someone else\u2019s home is never an option.

I once spilt an entire water bottle and it didn't get through...\n\nIn this situation if I felt pressure to stay I'd have gone to the baby section at Walmart and gotten those thick ass Gerber fabric baby diapers that look like they're from 1940. \n\nThose things can absorb so damn much and tbh I only know this because a housekeeper I worked with swore by them for dusting and cleaning rags because they're soft, easy to wash, and absorbent.\n\nI'd also be like getting a shitty hand towel from Walmart or whatever and putting them in undies if they didn't have those.\n\nIdk there were things OP could have figured out \n\nEven if I am pro-period, even if I think very often people are weird about encountering evidence of menstruation, it makes MIL uncomfortable/it's MIL's house/it's MIL's sheets and guest bed. At this point IDK if we can believe OP re: no stains. \n\nThe washing machine bit is whack, though, and would still be a problem. Gross shit is guaranteed washed in there. Cleaning rags? Mops?

Also, putting health first would mean seeing ob/gyn about this combo of heavy bleeding and skin sensitivities/allergies impeding hygiene.\n\nOP, why are you staying at your MIL's home? If it is remotely about celebrating others' birthdays, you are clearly making that difficult for the host and other family, while bleeding on to furniture. Either go home with your spouse (be a team committed to free bleeding), or layer up. For myself, I learned that heavy days require period underwear (a few pairs of Thinx to switch out between washes, with maximum coverage preventing leakage), with a thick overnight adhesive winged pad, and super+ cotton tampons I change frequently. I also gently wash myself with water and a light soap (external parts) every few hours during heavy days because period blood can have a strong scent. \n\nHygiene is a social agreement, so you have to decide if you want to be around others (not free bleeding in their home) or return to your personal space. Demanding others to accommodate your practices (bloodborne pathogens exposure, furniture stains, etc) would make YTA.",

Dispose of any paper towels the way you would a used pad or tampon by using the trashcan. Mostly I was trying to rinse it enough so that it wouldn't become a slippery projectile, and technically you don't HAVE to rinse it, just empty and reinsert.
