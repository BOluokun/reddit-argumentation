  "post content": "I went out the past weekend with 2 friends.  I'm 29 but I have a \"babyface\" so I still get carded regularly.  I'm used to that and have no issues. \n\n\nWell we went to a sports bar/restaurant place and the bartender \"Trent\" carded me. No big deal. Then some random guy was sitting a few seats away said \"how old is she?\"  Trent said \"well she was born in '92 so...29\" I was holding out my hand expecting to get it back because I thought he was done. Random guy said \"no way let me see\" and Trent walked over and  handed him my license. I said \"um excuse me can I have my license back?\" Bartender said \"yea just a sec\". Then the guy next to random guy took it and looked at it. \n\nWhen Trent finally gave it back I sarcastically said \"thanks for passing my personal information around \". \n\nMy friend Lilly that knows Trent said \"they were just messing around calm down \"  so I didn't say anything else about it til when we were on our way home.  \n\nI said \"I can't believe you're friends with that tool\". Lilly said \"he was just kidding around you need to lighten up\" and apparently him and \"Billy\" and \"Rob\" are friends.  \n\nIf it was something that just had my age, I wouldn't care but my license (like everyone's) has my first name last name, address, and I don't know Billy and Rob from a hole in the wall.  \n\nWhen I told my boyfriend he laughed and said \"they were probably trying to flirt \" and I should just let it go, that my past is causing me to be paranoid.  Because I had a coworker borderline stalking me a few years ago, luckily he didn't know where I lived but he'd \"show up\" randomly when I was in public A LOT. I'm sure if he knew where I lived he'd have shown up there too. \n\nIt bothered me Sunday and Monday. I could easily not go back there, and probably won't but my thinking is if he's passing around my ID he's doing it to other people.  \n\nI called the place yesterday and asked to talk to a manager and said what happened.  \n\nLilly called and yelled at me earlier, she said that \"they were just messing around,  it wasn't serious enough for me to call and get him in trouble, that I embarrassed her by acting like a uptight bitch and making a big thing over a joke\".  \n\nMaybe they are harmless and it was probably just a joke, but it's more the principle of it. \n\nAITA should I have just let it go?",
