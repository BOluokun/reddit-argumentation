  "post content": "On mobile, sorry for formatting.\n\nSome of you may remember me from the post I made about my brother talking through 'Supernatural, so I'm just here to see if I'd be the a-hole for this situation.\n\nSo, every now and then, my mom gets it into her head that she has to share a favorite movie of hers and dad's. Last night, we watched 'office space' and I  (f16) really liked it, but for whatever reason, my brother (m14) was super stressed for pretty much the entire movie. Now, the stress isn't what I have a problem with, I get stressed easily too (I'm autistic, and tend to get overstimulated  a lot), it was the way he handled it. \n\nFor example, my little sister (f5) was wandering around our living room, doing little things like gently tapping on a xylophone, like you could barely hear it, if at all, and he WOULD NOT let my mom or dad handle the situation, he kept stepping in, taking control of the situation, getting mad at me for silently browsing Reddit, and generally  just acting... subpar, to put it lightly. Eventually, it got to the point where me and my dad couldn't stand to be in the same room as him, and my dad LOVES that movie.\n\nI really don't want to do movie night anymore, but I know that my mom will be mad at me if I say as much. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I feel like I may be the a-hole because I know how much it means to my mom, and I really don't want her to be disappointed in me, but I have literally  ZERO motivation to ever do movie night again. Ever.",

There are compromises to be made and you don't see it because you are seeing it as punishment or obligation.\n\nYou mom wants movie night have movie night.\n\nDuh. You'll be 18 and an adult soon enough. Learn patience, negotiation skills and learn to do something that you don't really want to do. \n\nDon't get a job, don't get into a relationship or have friends. Doing it always your way is a lonely life.",
