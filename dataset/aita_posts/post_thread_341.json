  "post content": "My ex and I had an peaceful divorce. We co-parent our 3 children together and there haven\u2019t really been many issues. My ex is getting married to Stephanie. I like Stephanie she has been great with my kids and makes my ex happy. My ex invited me to their wedding and I was happy for him. It was my day with the kids so it made sense for me to come was his reasoning. When I arrived at the wedding Stephanie thanked me for dropping the kids off and brushed me off. We had never had any issues before.\n\nI explained that I was going to stay for the reception and she was very upset. I was confused because I assumed she knew I would be in attendance. It turned out she didn\u2019t consider that I would actually accept the invitation. I told her that I was invited and since I took the 2 hour drive I would be staying for the entire duration. She didn\u2019t like this response. Stephanie asked me to leave and I stood my ground. She went on to complain about my dress upstaging hers. My ex and former mother in law helped her to calm down and the wedding shortly began.\n\nI thought that was the end of it, but later in private Stephanie accused me of trying to ruin her special day. She is convinced that I wanted to show off and make the wedding about my divorce. She said it was rude for me not to leave after the bride requested it because it was her special day. I told her that I am not responsible for her insecurities and once again reminded her that I have no interest in \u201dstealing\u201d my ex back.\n\nEdit: the dress is posted on my page and since this is a throwaway i don\u2019t remember the random password i typed up. i will also be active on u/closureseekingex2",

This post itself isn\u2019t even that subtle.\n\nThe very best of this sub is when the other party finds the post and gives their side.",

She deleted everything prior to posting here to try to deceive everyone.

All were people either asking if or was true or people just spreading this \u201crule.\u201d \n\nMoreover, literally billions of women get married in red (China, India etc), many more than get married in white. I\u2019ve only ever seen and heard the whole red means they slept with the groom, and generally tacky to wear red, in America. In India it\u2019s not just the bride but many of the female guests too. My first wedding was in a dress made from a red sari. \n\n\n(I know Reddit is America heavy but not only is it world wide, America itself is a melting pot with significant numbers of women whose cultures are red dress affairs. I always find it curious when declarations are made about how things are done - without any obvious awareness the rest of the world exists.)\n\nETA I still think OP is an AH though because she wore a dress sold as a wedding dress, it was not a guest outfit imo. Plus the bride asked her to leave - that should have been enough in and of itself. She clearly didn\u2019t care what the bride wanted so why stay at for a wedding when you can\u2019t wish the bride well enough to respect her wishes at her own wedding. YTA OP.",

But, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for wearing a pretty dress and not leaving. Reason being: Stephanie had two chances before her wedding day to address this. First, she could have made sure you were not sent an invite. Second, she could have rescinded the invite once you RSVP\u2019d \u201cyes.\u201d It\u2019s her own fault for waiting until you showed up to deal with this. She ruined her own wedding day.",
