  "post content": "My girlfriend (22F) and I (26M) have been together for almost 4 years and live together. \nShe has a stable career and has bought herself a car and was taught to drive in high school. \n\nI was never taught to drive, and it\u2019s not really necessary because I can uber, take the bus, or my girlfriend can drive. She\u2019s offered before to teach me to drive, but I decline because I\u2019m not really interested in learning because I don\u2019t plan on getting a car since they\u2019re a lot of money. \n\nSo, my birthday was yesterday and my girlfriend was really excited to give me my gift. It was private driving lessons, which admittedly cost her several hundred dollars. I was really offended because I don\u2019t want to learn to drive. She hyped the gift up like I\u2019d love it, but I honestly hate it. It seems more like it\u2019s for her because she wants me to learn to drive, than it is for me. \n\nI got really upset and disappointed when I opened it and she kept pushing to ask why I didn\u2019t like it. I told her again that I don\u2019t care for driving and it seemed like a really impersonal gift, because I don\u2019t even want my license or a car so why would I want this? I felt like she doesn\u2019t even know me. And she got really upset so I suggested she return the lessons and get me something I would like better. \n\nNow she\u2019s calling me an AH and said the lessons are non-refundable, and is really upset with me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH because I\u2019ve told her before that I don\u2019t want to drive and I feel like she\u2019s trying to change me. So now she\u2019s being immature and won\u2019t drive me anywhere and tells me I can uber if I want to go somewhere, even if it\u2019s somewhere she was going to go already. Like she went thrifting and to the grocery store without me (we always go together) and said if I really wanted to go that badly, I can uber. \n\nIt\u2019s not even like I ask her for rides ever, I just tag along if she\u2019s already going somewhere. I get uber\u2019s to and from work and have a good job. So it\u2019s pointless for me to even get a car or license. \n\nWhen I told her that she said that she\u2019s tired of always being the driver and likes to be the passenger sometimes, but to me it sounds like she gave me a gift that *she* wants. Because if she hates being the driver so much, I suggested that I could get lessons for *her* birthday, not mine, and that upset her even more. She said that isn\u2019t a gift for her and she\u2019d be upset if I got myself driving lessons for her birthday. I told her basically \u201csee, so you\u2019d be upset if I got you something that you think is for me for YOUR birthday\u201d and she said yes. So even though I explained to her there\u2019s a double standard, she\u2019s still insisting that I\u2019m the AH.",

I have to though, especially if we want groceries or to run out to the store. It doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but always having to drive can put strain in relationships.

If I NEVER got that free time because I felt obligated to always take my partner who refuses to drive, I think I would be thinking of ways to convince him to drive before the 4 year mark too. Plus she gave him an expensive gift of driving lessons while he mentions the monetary reasons why he doesn\u2019t drive. She could possibly be thinking she was helping take some of the money off his plate that he complains about.",
