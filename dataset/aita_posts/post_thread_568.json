  "post content": "so i've had this friend for years, online as she lives in cali but travels for work. we used to talk a lot when we were younger and then it slowed down but now, for the most part, our longest conversations happen when she is bored or lonely or looking for some sort of validation. the other night we started talking while she was out at a bar and eventually she asked me if i would essentially validate her and make her feel better about herself (she thinks she is overweight) and i might get something for it. Of course i agree and we keep chatting and it kinda gets side tracked as we talk about a bunch of other things, all while i still manage to complement the fuck out of her and build her up. at one point she made the point to say \"we're basically in like a loooooong distance poly-emotional relationship\" (she's actually in a poly relationship with someone else) and also say how great i am for always being there for her no matter if she talks to me for hours on end or just once a month and how she appreciates me. after a few hours of talking and me staying up way past my usual bed time to keep her company, she falls asleep on me, which is nbd. but the next morning she read any messages i had left her and then just doesn't reply, no thanks for keeping me company or hey i appreciate that, she just goes right back to not replying. \nAITA for being annoyed even tho she explained the night before that that is basically just how she is? im just sick of building people up only to be ignored when they dont need the confidence boost for the time being\n\nEDIT: i also would feel like the A-hole if right after she was like \"im so glad youre always here for me even if i dont reply all the time\" and then i come back with \"yeah im mad you're not as good of a friend as i want you to be\" if that makes sense",

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole because your needs aren\u2019t being met, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s purposefully being an asshole either. \n\nDo you reach out to her when you need her, or only wait for her to message you? Long distance friendships are a two way street. If you want to talk more, you could reach out more often! If she actively never answers your messages, then you\u2019re NTA.",

I\u2019m kind of like her - I have a hard time keeping up long distance conversations because I honestly don\u2019t have an interesting life so unless something major (usually bad tbh) happens, I don\u2019t have much to say. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to let her know you\u2019d like her to be better about replying because it makes you feel sad/angry/lonely/etc when you message and she doesn\u2019t answer. If she doesn\u2019t change after saying that though, I don\u2019t think pushing the issue will help",
