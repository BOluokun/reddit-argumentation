  "post content": "Throwaway Acct. Not new to Reddit.  \n\nI **[Male, 31]** am a Sr. Administrative Assistant and Undergraduate Registrar at an American university.  I built and maintain the department's website, handle our social media, book travel for our faculty and guest lecturers, process honorarium payments, reimburse personal expenses, process expense reports, list all our courses, track all our students grades and progress in the major, handle all work requests, hire student workers to assist me in the office, on-board new faculty and a whole lot more. \n\nTo the heart of this issue; there are many older faculty members who have been in the department since the 70's and remember a time when they had secretaries.  Many of them will make a mistake now and then and refer to me as a secretary.  Oh well, shit happens. We do not have any secretaries here at this point, and there is a genuine difference between a secretary and an administrative assistant.  Aside from the dated connotations behind the word secretary, I am not a receptionist.  I have an office with a door that locks, I set my own hours and can even work from home when needed.\n\nOne professor has, for the last 4 years I have been in this role, often referred to me as *his* personal secretary.  He is currently the chair of the department (just started his appointment this fall), and will do things like: \u201cDear guest, please continue this correspondence with my secretary, cc\u2019d on this conversation\u201d, or will come by my office to ask, \u201cwhat are you and the other secretaries up to this weekend\u201d.  He is mid 60\u2019s and not insanely old or out of touch and it always seems to be incredibly intentional.  \n\nI have politely asked him to not refer to me as his secretary at least 10 times, and my Operations Manager has spoken with him about it.  Two WEEKS ago, I had enough after he said to another professor \u201cisn\u2019t our secretary fantastic! They really don\u2019t make them like they used to!\u201d (note I am 31 years old so\u2026 not *that* old).  I reported this along with documentation from previous offenses to HR and it escalated to the point that he has been *asked* (re: told) to step down as chair before the start of next semester.  He also has to attend some 30 hours of training.  \n\nOther admin asst.\u2019s and sundry staff have heard about all of this and are adamant that I am an asshole for costing him a prestigious posting (and the money that comes with it) and that I needed to just suck it up because he is a product of a different era.  I feel that I worked hard to get where I am and take pride in my role.  Even if I was a receptionist I do not think that *secretary* has much of a place in modern lingo.\n\n**EDIT** weeks not months\n\n**EDIT EDIT** I am a man, added to the top as well.\n\n**THE RETURN OF THE EDIT** I do not take offense to being called secretary so much as I take offense to him refusing to respect my 10+ polite requests *not* to be called it. Most faculty refer to by my name, the rest as the admin.  Some call me the registrar if I am fulfilling that role.  \n\nI even included that randomly other professors have called me secretary and I move on, as shit happens.  His specifically was repeated and on purpose, in defiance of polite requests and a request from my supervisor. That is what sucks and what my issue is with him.",

The general counsel (lawyer) for a corporation is usually designated the \"board secretary\" because he or she is the secret-keeper.

More women didn't start entering the job until the 1930s (because typing) and it didn't become female-dominated until after WWII.\n\nI used to be a lawyer and I honestly vastly prefer the term \"secretary,\" because to me that connotes a close co-worker who can be trusted with secrets and confidential work; an administrative assistant keeps calendars and works the reception desk. A secretary can keep your FILES and can type confidential memoranda and is your second, external brain who can be trusted with your internal and attorney-client privileged thoughts.\n\nI call people admin assistants when they ask! (Because I do not suck.) But if I work closely with an assistant who is privy to my confidential work and who assists me on all the tricky parts and knows all the corporate secrets I know, I would vastly prefer to call them my \"secretary.\" And sometimes I call them my secretary in my office and when I recognize them on secretary's day, and my administrative assistant in recommendation letters.

My goal is to have the best assistants, not to force them to comply to particular and outdated definitions of specific terms! And if they said, \"I totally understand why you prefer secretary, but I prefer administrative assistant,\" that would be FINE and I would comply.))\n\nI would add that I am a woman and I am SUPER aware of how sexist the term \"secretary\" can be, and I always try to avoid using it in contexts where it might sound sexist, and would and do always absolutely respect my assistants' desires w/r/t the term and its sexist connotations.

Your college has secretaries, they're just called \"Administrative Assistant\" because I guess some people (like yourself) are sensitive and want to sound more important (btw, a good secretary is pretty important so it's pretty lame that you're being offended over this).\n\n>there is a genuine difference between a secretary and an administrative assistant.\n\nThat's debatable. I mean, of course not all assistants are secretaries but your job description sounds more or less the same as the secretaries of any college I've been too. And like I said, considering this place doesn't have \"secretaries\" just means that they have that same position  but it's just under a different name. Colleges need secretaries. Sounds like you're just insecure about your job and you want to sound as important as possible. You getting offended by being called a secretary (when you technically are one) is just an insult to secretaries and to yourself.",

The professor is refusing to call OP by his name.  He is using this word for a reason.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out why \"they sure don't make 'em like they used to!\" is a joke.
